March has come and gone and everyone is learning a new way of life and staying safe at home when possible due to the impact of the COVID-19 virus. We've chose to use this time to strengthen our relationships with Christ through more time in His Word and in prayer and clinging to the positives of our world being put "on hold". With that, we officially shared the name of our church. We are Inspiring Hope Church. In March, we shared through a Facebook live video this huge announcement. We are so excited to begin sharing the heart behind our church and our mission as “we exist to inspire hope by helping people discover God’s purpose for their lives through a relationship with Jesus.” God has inspired us through His Word and prayer to be a church that wants to meet people where they are and to bring the hope of Jesus, through a daily relationship with Him. We see God continuing to do amazing things in our lives as He is growing us closer to Him and others during this journey. I’d like to say that everything has been great, but as you know we are all living in a world that is so different than it was a short time ago.

We have had to restructure the home group which we are now calling our “Inspire Group” that was supposed to start in March. Originally, it was going to be for those we were connecting with in the community, but now it’s been a time for us to connect via Zoom with our core team back in Oklahoma to worship, study and pray together. Even though this is different than what we planned, we realize God’s plans are always better than our own and it has been such a sweet time for us. The great news is that even though we haven’t been able to connect with people the way we have wanted, we have still been able to meet some more of our neighbors (from a distance of course). One of them said they are very interested in what we are doing and want to come to our Inspire Group when we are able to meet again. We know that if God is for us who can be against us? That includes this whole virus that is changing the course of our church planting journey. God is moving and we are believing in faith that He is going to bring about a great movement in our community one person at a time as they discover God’s purpose for their lives through a relationship with Jesus.

## Please Pray:

- FOR OUR FAMILY AS WE CONTINUE TO ADJUST TO OUR NEW COMMUNITY AND ESPECIALLY DURING THIS TIME AWAY FROM OTHER PEOPLE.
- FOR OUR NEXT FUNDRAISING GOAL TO ADD 25 NEW PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING ANY AMOUNT MONTHLY TO OUR MINISTRY.
- FOR OUR INSPIRE GROUP AND CORE TEAM AS WE WORK TO FIND NEW WAYS TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE.
- FOR WISDOM AS WE NAVIGATE THE NEW NORM DURING THIS VIRUS.

## A God Story...

A verse that we have clung to is Hebrews 11:6.

We have believed and prayed that God would build His church and bring a team to help us plant Inspiring Hope Church. He answered our prayers by sending Brock and Jenna, along with their daughter Brooklynn, to plant with us. This couple's faith has been so inspiring to us. They are an amazing addition to our leadership team here and their calling is filled with so many faith steps of saying yes to Jesus.Please be praying for their transition here in May and for all those who will miss them dearly in Oklahoma. God IS building His church! We praise Him for sending this couple to plant alongside us.

## Many Thanks...

You are moving mountains! God is hearing your prayers and using your financial support to help plant Inspiring Hope Church. Thank you so much for continuing to help us share the hope of the Gospel to those around us. We thank God for you and know that we couldn’t do this without you!
