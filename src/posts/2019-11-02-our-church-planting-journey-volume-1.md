This is our first official monthly newsletter for our family ministry. Thank you so much for letting us know that you want to be on the mailing list to stay up-to-date with what God is doing through our ministry. For those who don't know we have officially sold our home here in Tahlequah, OK and are currently staying in the parsonage by CVBC, our current home church. We will be moving to Cincinnati, Ohio around January 1st. This past week was extremely hard and I know as the weeks go on things will get harder as we close one chapter and move on to the next. Currently, we are working on trying to get the rest of our funding in order to get on the ground in Cincinnati. We are 45% funded as of today. Ben will be meeting with other pastors soon trying to get church partnerships. We are also still talking with individuals.

This is what we will be doing while we are still in Oklahoma as well as finishing up work, kids finishing this semester of school, and spending the holidays with our families. We are excited to continue to share this journey with you monthly. God is already doing some amazing things.

We can't wait to see the Lord continue to move throughout the process.

> ...If Your Presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here.
> EXODUS 33:15 NKJV

## Please Pray:

- That we receive the remainder of our funding
- That we will continue to be obedient to the call through the good and the challenging
- For the people of Cincinnati to be ready to hear the Gospel as it's presented
- That the Lord will surround us with a community of believers.

## A God Story...

We've had a lot of God stories along the way but we wanted to take the time to share a recent one with you. When we move to Cincinnati in January the North American Mission Board will be providing transitional housing for the first year. We had originally been told they would not be able to provide this housing close to where we wanted to plant because other church planters will be using the home in the future which meant it needed to be in a central location. We were informed last week that the home we will be living in is in EXACT AREA we are wanting to plant! God is always at work and this is going to help us in making connections and developing relationships right away. God is so good!

## Many Thanks...

We want to say thank you again to everyone who has partnered with us so far whether it was through an up-front gift or a monthly contribution. We mean it when we say we can not do this without your willingness to give. Thank you for being apart of this endeavor with us. Thank you for helping us reach the greater Cincinnati area with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We will continue to share ways along this journey of how you can further give to this mission. Thank you for being vessels and willing. We love you all!!
