## Update...

February has come and gone and it seems like it really flew. We are finally starting to feel like Ohio is home even though we miss our friends and family tremendously. We realize more than ever the importance of having a group of people that we do life with daily. Speaking of that, we are excited that on March 23rd we will start our first home group where we will meet people, study the Word, and develop a church planting team. God has been really growing us and reminding us over and over again that He is planting this church. We are trusting Him to provide people who will come to our group and be a part of what He is doing. We are looking to plant a church in a city called Hamilton which is right outside of the Cincinnati area and right next to where we live. We have been spending a lot of time getting out in our community. We are doing this and also research as tools to get to know our community and understand the people we are trying to reach. In doing this research, we have found that 51% of the homes in Hamilton that have children are single parent homes. Hearing this (among other things) has made us aware of how many families may need help and schools who may need support to provide needs for them. The task we have in front of us is bigger than we can handle but with God all things are possible! We are here to help reach a city and lift the name of Christ above all we do. Coming up soon... we will be sharing some exciting news! We can’t wait to tell you all about it. God is opening doors and moving in a mighty way and we are excited about the days ahead. Stay tuned.

## PLEASE PRAY:

- FOR GOD TO OPEN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE WE MEET AND FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO SHARE CHRIST WITH THEM.
- FOR BEN AS HE CONTINUES HIS TRAINING AND WORKS ON COMPLETING THE MISSION, VISION AND VALUES OF OUR CHURCH.
- FOR THE START OF OUR HOME GROUP ON MARCH 23RD AND FOR THOSE WHO MAY ATTEND.
- FOR OUR NEXT FUNDRAISING GOAL OF AN ADDITIONAL \$5,000 A MONTH IN SUPPORT.

## A God Story...

(From Ben)

There are several stories that we could share about how God has been moving but we want to share with you the story about us connecting with our neighbors. We have been trying to get to know anyone around us that we can. We have had several opportunities to just hang out and get to know several of our neighbors. We have even had gospel conversations with some of them and told them about us planting a church. They seem to be very interested in learning more about Christ and possibly being a part of what we are doing. We are seeing God work through these new relationships and are praying that God would draw them to Him and for them to come to faith in Christ.

## Many Thanks...

Without the prayers and support of each one of you we would not be able to be here to share the hope of the Gospel to those around us. Thank you so much for your generosity and willingness to sacrifice. There's not a day that goes by that we don’t thank God for all of you. You encourage us and spur us on to do the work that God has called us to do.
