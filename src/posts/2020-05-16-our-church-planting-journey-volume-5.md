## Update...

The last couple of months have been so different than we had expected them to be. Even in the midst of different, we have found an overwhelming peace with where God has us and what He is doing. We have clung to our faith and the things we could control and we prayed and let go and let God work in the ways we couldn’t. In April we celebrated Ben’s birthday by surprising him with a zoom call with many of his friends to wish him a happy birthday. Thank you to all of you who were able to be a part of that. It meant so much to him.

In May, Ben finished his training with the North American Mission Board. This training has been so valuable to him. It has given him the direction to help our church plant be strong and has helped him be confident in the church that God is wanting to plant.

One of the most encouraging things that happened in May was we were able to come back to Oklahoma and see all our family and some of our friends. Ben got to preach the live-streamed service the Sunday we went back. It was an emotional day for us. Coming back and not being able to see our church family was so hard. So many people at Crescent Valley have prayed for, encouraged, and supported us from the day we first started attending CVBC. We wouldn’t be where we are today without each one of them and that day all the emotions hit us as we remembered each one them. We were however able to see some of them during the week and that was so refreshing!

Since being in Cincinnati, we haven’t been able to meet and get to know too many families with the stay at home orders. Being completely honest, it’s difficult when at times you feel so alone yet know God has you right where He wants you. The trip to Oklahoma was good for us and the greatest part was when we came back, we were able to welcome Brock, Jenna and their daughter Brooklyn to Cincinnati. They moved the same day we came back and are getting settled. There are bright days ahead for our family and the ministry here. We are clinging to God’s promises and trusting the process.

## PLEASE PRAY:

- For direction and wisdom on how to meet people and getting involved in our community this summer.
- For our family and the Cherry family to cling to the Lord and live the lives God is calling us to live where we are.
- For our community, neighbors and city to be open to the Gospel and for God to send labors to partner with us to go engage people.
- For our next fundraising goal to add 25 new people who are giving any amount monthly to our ministry.

## A God Story...

In everything that happens in life we should give God glory. That's why every month we want to highlight what God’s doing to build His church. God continues to add team members to our launch team. We are so excited to introduce you to Riley! Riley had committed to coming to plant with us at the end of last year, but still had to finish college at Northeastern State before moving out this fall. The more we have gotten to know her, we realize that God has been working in and through her life over the last several years preparing her to be a part of our team here in Cincinnati. We can’t wait to have her move here and join us in this great work! Please be praying for her during this transition over the next several months. Welcome to the team, Riley! Inspiring Hope is incredibly blessed to have you.

## Many Thanks...

We don’t take for granted the amount of people that have prayed, encouraged and supported us over these past 5 months. We want to say thank you for joining us in this mission to plant Inspiring Hope Church in order to inspire hope by helping people discover God’s purpose for their lives through a relationship with Jesus.
