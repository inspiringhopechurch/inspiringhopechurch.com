00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.720
i know uh we have several missing&nbsp;
today i've had several text messages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.960
either today or last night that says hey we're&nbsp;
going to be watching online we're filming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.040
under the weather which i'm always happy hey yes&nbsp;
go get well and so if you're joining us online&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.240
hope you're awake and uh if you're near pajamas&nbsp;
don't take pictures and post them online it's okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.000
but excited about starting um the second part&nbsp;
of our series so we have started a series uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.320
this christmas season called the season of&nbsp;
praise and so last week we got to talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.640
mary's praise and getting to hear her side of&nbsp;
the story of the what we would say is the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.720
christmas right as christ was coming mary gave&nbsp;
praise and it was interesting as mary gave praise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.800
how she gave praise not only for what god did for&nbsp;
her which i'm telling you guys i think that's one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.720
of the easiest things as believers to give&nbsp;
praise to god for what he's done for us but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.600
she gave praise to god for what he had also done&nbsp;
by sending jesus for her people for her people of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.000
israel so she understood the people in her life&nbsp;
that was most important to her that god had sent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.640
his son obviously to be born through her to be&nbsp;
the mother of this son to save her people and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.920
so she was giving god praise for that but one&nbsp;
of the last things we learned in the midst of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.320
mary's praise was how she was praising god that&nbsp;
he had sent jesus for everyone for everyone and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.600
and so this this praise reminded each one of us&nbsp;
that we have a reason to give praise right we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.520
have a reason to give praise because what god's&nbsp;
done for us what god's done for those in our city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.920
and in our neighborhood and in our families&nbsp;
and what god has done for everyone and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.400
is something that we miss sometimes in this season&nbsp;
because why this season is busy i think one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.720
text messages i got today and i totally get it&nbsp;
it's been a busy week and if you're anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.600
probably like most families you've already&nbsp;
started christmas dinners christmas meetups&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.800
or you're buying christmas gifts or there's&nbsp;
christmas parties at your work or you name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.120
it right and so we get easily distracted in this&nbsp;
season by everything else which i would say this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.800
i love everything else right we have decorations&nbsp;
we have presents we just had our um inspiring hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.840
christmas party on friday we loved it i mean i i&nbsp;
was excited about it and so those things are good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.120
but the greatest part of this season is so&nbsp;
much greater than those things it's jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.920
and so that's why we're talking about&nbsp;
the season of praise the season of praise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.960
and so as we kind of jump into today's we're going&nbsp;
to be in luke chapter two um we're going to read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.800
uh starting in verse run one going through 20&nbsp;
but we're going to kind of focus in on verses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.640
8 through 20. and um as we jump into this text&nbsp;
i want you to see this this is from a different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.080
perspective this is the angels and how they praise&nbsp;
god and what their praise led again they were they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.640
were praising god and they were really showing&nbsp;
themselves to the shepherds and their praise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.760
in this text ended up leading these shepherds to&nbsp;
experience a couple of different things one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.840
things that they did is is out after seeing the&nbsp;
angels praise it led the shepherds to go see jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.800
and then after they went and saw jesus it&nbsp;
led them to go tell others what they had seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.040
and after they had told others what they had&nbsp;
seen they had went back to go being shepherds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.480
and they gave god praise and we're going to learn&nbsp;
through this text how important it is for us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.240
that as we see other people praise as we see&nbsp;
in this this word how the angels praise that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.520
should go do those same three things we should&nbsp;
go see jesus we should have a relationship with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.120
jesus that we should go tell others what we have&nbsp;
experienced and that we should give praise to god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.760
as well not only during the season of praise but&nbsp;
in our season of life we should do this and so if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.400
you'll um join me in here again luke chapter two&nbsp;
i'm gonna start in verse one and uh if you found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.720
your place say amen all right we got three of you&nbsp;
good if you don't have it it's up on the screen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.080
so in those days a decree went out from&nbsp;
caesar augustus that the whole empire should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:27.280
be registered this first registration took place&nbsp;
while coernius was governor of syria so everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.400
went to be registered each to his own town and&nbsp;
joseph also went up from the town of nazareth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.920
in galilee to judea to the city of david which&nbsp;
is called bethlehem and because he was was of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.480
the house and the family line of david to be&nbsp;
registered along with mary who was engaged to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.920
him and was pregnant and while they were there a&nbsp;
time came for her to give birth and then she gave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.200
birth to her firstborn son and she wrapped him&nbsp;
tightly in cloth and laid him in a manger because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.280
there was no guest room available for them and in&nbsp;
the same region shepherds were staying out in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.200
fields and keeping watch at night over the flock&nbsp;
and then an angel of the lord stood before them

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.960
in the glory of the lord shone around them and&nbsp;
they were terrified but the angels said to them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.880
don't be afraid for look i proclaim to you good&nbsp;
news of great joy that will be for all people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.840
today in the city of david a savior was born for&nbsp;
who is the messiah the lord this will be your sign&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.760
for you you will find a baby wrapped tightly in&nbsp;
cloth and lying in a manger and suddenly there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.440
a multitude of hosts with the angel praising&nbsp;
god and saying glory to god in the highest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.120
and peace on earth to all people he favors and&nbsp;
when the angels had left them and returned to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.240
heaven the shepherd said to one another let's go&nbsp;
straight to bethlehem and see what has happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.560
which the lord has made known to us and so they&nbsp;
hurried off and they both found mary and joseph&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.960
and the baby who was lying in a manger and after&nbsp;
seeing them they reported the message they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.040
told about this child and all who heard it were&nbsp;
amazed at the shepherds had said to them but mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.600
was treasuring up for these things in her heart&nbsp;
and meditating on them and the shepherds returned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.200
to glorify glorifying god and praising him for&nbsp;
all the things they had seen and heard which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.840
they had just been told so let's pray lord jesus&nbsp;
we're so thankful lord for today and lord we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.920
so thankful for you and lord we know that you&nbsp;
are here to speak to each one of us in this room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.240
so lord i just pray that you open up our hearts&nbsp;
and minds and lord i just pray that those who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.360
may be joining us online lord are doing the same&nbsp;
thing lord that they are are here to hear from you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.920
and to be reminded lord to be praising you&nbsp;
during this season and to be thankful for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.200
what you've done by sending your son jesus and so&nbsp;
lord we just pray this in your heavenly name amen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.520
so as i was thinking through this&nbsp;
one i was thinking through is as we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.080
come into the story of jesus many of it in this&nbsp;
of us in this room may actually know you know hey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.560
so was jesus talked about before this point and&nbsp;
how many times was he talked about and that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.040
where we learned if you've ever studied the the&nbsp;
bible enough the old testament talks a lot about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.560
prophecies of jesus's coming and as i begin to&nbsp;
think about this is as god's you know eternal plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.240
what right was to have a perfect relationship with&nbsp;
us and that relationship was broken at the garden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.360
right whenever the adam and eve sinned um he had&nbsp;
a plan to redeem us and to save us and have that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.400
relationship with us again and so he decided to&nbsp;
begin to prophesy or begin to proclaim that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:40.320
coming messiah was was coming right all through&nbsp;
the old testament so as i began to study there was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:47.840
this this as i begin to study this is about 300&nbsp;
prophecies that had uh spoke about the coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.320
messiah jesus which i thought man that's that's&nbsp;
amazing so to begin to even study it more i came&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.960
across this article that said this that that&nbsp;
for many of those prophecies to come true it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:03.520
would almost be impossible and so this professor&nbsp;
decided to do a study with his students he took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.520
eight prophecies of jesus and began to say hey&nbsp;
what's the likelihood of these things coming true&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.280
and obviously they did come true because we'll&nbsp;
we'll find references in the new testament that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.760
says that they come true but he began to research&nbsp;
this and he says this is the and probability these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.320
eight would have come true it was um 1 in 10 to&nbsp;
the 17th power which y'all i don't know what that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.480
number is but whenever i started typing into&nbsp;
my calculator it was long right so he gave me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.320
a little bit more of an image when i started&nbsp;
looking at it he says take a half dollar coins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.400
lay them across the state of texas two feet&nbsp;
deep and that is one to the 10 i think it's 10&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.800
to the 17th power when we think about this and&nbsp;
so what he basically said was if you were to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:51.040
a person blindfolded take one coin mark it throw&nbsp;
it in that pile again state of texas two feet deep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.760
and let them roam wherever they wanted to pull&nbsp;
that coin out that would be one essay it's one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.680
but to the 10 to the 17th power right so what he's&nbsp;
saying is for these eight prophecies to come true&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.800
that had to happen and it did and we even know&nbsp;
there's more prophecies of jesus and so this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.480
idea behind is is jesus really the son of god&nbsp;
the one who has been sent by god to save us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:20.160
from our sins absolutely he is and the&nbsp;
improbability of this all coming true could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.120
only happen because of the divine intervention&nbsp;
of god and that i just again took some time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:34.000
just study about that because at times we miss&nbsp;
the awe of how jesus made it to this world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.400
how god had planned like at times like we think oh&nbsp;
it's just so simple and you know just whatever but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.760
no like god had been planning this for so long&nbsp;
and so when we see these people praise right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:51.280
we see mary prays and we see the angels praise why&nbsp;
are they praising because what has been prophesied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:58.400
for many many years is finally coming true i know&nbsp;
about you guys i know for me whenever i was in in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.040
high school and in college i couldn't wait for&nbsp;
the day i graduated that was exciting enough for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:09.760
me to get praised when i graduated but this is so&nbsp;
much bigger than that so much bigger than that so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.480
another thing i started thinking about as i began&nbsp;
to study through this is we're looking at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.200
angels praise them so what's the angel's role and&nbsp;
so i just again i'm not going in a deep study of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.480
like the angel's role in our lives but as i begin&nbsp;
to just look at what is the purpose of angels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.560
we see in this message the purpose of the angels&nbsp;
was to declare a message for us it's a message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:38.640
of hope right of the coming messiah but there was&nbsp;
more as i began to study in hebrews 1 14 it talks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:45.040
about angels it says are they not ministering&nbsp;
spirits sent out to serve those who are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.640
to inherit salvation so i thought that was&nbsp;
really cool that angels are ministering spirits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:57.360
to serve those who are going to inherit salvation&nbsp;
so if you have given your life to jesus there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.640
angels that are ministering to you as you begin to&nbsp;
probably study more and more in the word you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.760
angels are there to not only minister or to&nbsp;
proclaim but they are really servants of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:16.320
lord to help those around them come to know christ&nbsp;
or to know the message of god and i just thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.440
that was really cool to begin to think through the&nbsp;
role of an angel right and so in this one right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.120
the angels are delivering a message to encourage&nbsp;
the shepherds and so as we dive deeper in this i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:33.200
really want to to just challenge you to lean in&nbsp;
because i believe when the word of god speaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.840
we need to read it one in the context which&nbsp;
means what is the angel saying to the shepherds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.040
but every time you open up the word of god&nbsp;
the word of god is speaking directly to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:51.360
and and he's saying this he's saying this is for&nbsp;
you the individual right and yes we need to look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.720
into context and we need to say hey what did&nbsp;
it mean for them to apply what it means for me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.880
but god is speaking directly to us today and this&nbsp;
is what i think he challenges us to do right as we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:08.000
begin to answer this question what did the angels&nbsp;
praise lead the shepherds to do and what does the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.120
angel's praise leads you to do so let's answer&nbsp;
that question together the first thing that we see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.440
is when the angels praise and again we're going to&nbsp;
kind of go over this again in verse 13 and 14 it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.880
says suddenly there was a multitude of heavenly&nbsp;
hosts with the angels praising god and saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:30.240
glory to god in the highest heaven and peace&nbsp;
on earth to the people he favors so the thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:36.400
we see is the first announcement of jesus birth&nbsp;
was the angels to the shepherds see last week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.880
was before jesus was born speaking to mary this&nbsp;
week it's really in the process of jesus being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.800
born and next week we're going to talk about after&nbsp;
jesus was born all these different praises right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:54.320
but have you wondered why the angels went to the&nbsp;
shepherds rather than the priests and the scribes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.560
anybody want to answer that question why you think&nbsp;
that the angels went to get declare this message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:05.840
to the shepherds rather than the priests and the&nbsp;
scribes anybody what do you think that happened

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.320
would there be a specific reason&nbsp;
why god would want to send angels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.160
to the shepherds first to declare this message

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.040
anybody got a wild guess just&nbsp;
thinking off the top of your head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.320
what's that spread faster that's a good one yeah&nbsp;
to make a point what point would he be making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.200
there we go that's good too yeah yeah&nbsp;
absolutely i think those are those are solid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.360
thoughts and i think there's more and more as we&nbsp;
begin to think through this but as we think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.520
the shepherds if you were to study a little&nbsp;
bit the shepherds were the low of the lowest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:48.400
now they weren't as low as those who would um have&nbsp;
to be lepers but it would be basically a step up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.400
from that most people would think that they were&nbsp;
unclean because again they were around animals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:59.040
so you would say okay so this is god's speaking&nbsp;
to the outcasts the ones who would be lowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:05.040
and if you guys remember from last week and if you&nbsp;
don't it's okay last week we learned he says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.480
mercy is given to the poor and lowly not to the&nbsp;
rich and mighty i want to read this verse back in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:18.080
mary's praise it says this in verse 50 of chapter&nbsp;
1 of luke it says his mercy is from generation to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.800
generation on those who fear him he has done a&nbsp;
mighty deed with his arm and he has scattered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.360
the proud because of the thoughts of their hearts&nbsp;
and he has toppled the mighty from their thrones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:33.200
and exalted the lowly he has satisfied the hungry&nbsp;
with good things and he sent the rich away empty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:39.520
and so we look at that and we understand that that&nbsp;
god has come not only for the rich but really he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:45.520
come for the lowly those who actually recognize&nbsp;
their need for christ and so these shepherds would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:52.400
be ones that maybe would have a need right to&nbsp;
actually recognize and accept this message and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:58.320
when the angels left right left them their&nbsp;
first response the shepherd's first response&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.600
was to do what what was their first response the&nbsp;
shepherd's first response once the angels left

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.760
was it to go back to work and shepherding they&nbsp;
wanted to go check it out right they wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.960
go check it out they wanted to go see what&nbsp;
had happened if this was true and so they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.480
went straight to bethlehem and i started thinking&nbsp;
through this and again i'm going to share this a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.000
little bit different than what i had originally&nbsp;
planned but obviously recently we've heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.480
over the last two days tornadoes and lots of&nbsp;
families lives have been lost and we need to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.280
praying for them and seeing how we can participate&nbsp;
in supporting the efforts of recovery in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.160
but i started thinking through this message&nbsp;
this week before those tornadoes come i started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.200
thinking about oklahomans when tornadoes&nbsp;
are talked about on the weather channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.480
this is what they do they go outside to go look&nbsp;
for the tornado it's just how we do it in oklahoma&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.200
i know everywhere else you don't do that but&nbsp;
we literally hear on the news tornadoes coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:58.080
towards you and we don't go hide we go look for&nbsp;
it so i started thinking about this this is what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.720
the shepherds did they got this news and they were&nbsp;
like we're just not going to take your word for it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.640
we're not just going to go back to work we're&nbsp;
going to go see it for ourselves and so i asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:14.960
myself this question why would they want to go&nbsp;
see it for themselves because they wanted to i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.440
don't know about you guys like when i hear that&nbsp;
food's good at a restaurant i'm like eh we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.320
see and i'll go test it out for myself and you&nbsp;
guys are probably a lot like me in this you just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.840
don't take people's words for things even if it's&nbsp;
an angel maybe you're not taking words but i want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:35.200
to ask this question because again i love getting&nbsp;
you guys engaged in in the message share with me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:42.080
a time when you heard news about something that&nbsp;
you went immediately and responded to it it caused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:49.840
you to respond to something you heard news and&nbsp;
immediately you did something in response to it

00:16:53.680 --> 00:17:01.040
what what was that your food was burning okay yes&nbsp;
so there's a good reason why you wouldn't check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:06.000
that food because it would probably cut the house&nbsp;
on fire right okay that's good what's another time

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.600
when a baby's born right so when your water&nbsp;
breaks at home you're going to respond quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:28.240
because you don't want to have that baby at home&nbsp;
right that's good so i'm bringing that up in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.280
fact of saying i think many of us and i'll just&nbsp;
give you a couple of examples uh many of us have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.440
probably received a phone call of a death of a&nbsp;
loved one right and so your your first response&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:44.560
is to go to family maybe it's weather as what&nbsp;
we've talked about also you know whenever we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.880
knew that the world was shutting down everybody&nbsp;
ran to the stores they immediately responded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:55.120
um here's another one if there's a cell i know my&nbsp;
grandma when she knew there was a sale going on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:00.320
she was out the door as quickly as possible so i&nbsp;
started thinking through this we respond quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:06.960
because it is important news and information&nbsp;
that needs a quick response so i think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:12.400
this right the angels just gave the shepherd some&nbsp;
amazing news the messiah the savior of the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:17.840
for all people has made his arrival right to bring&nbsp;
peace on earth and whenever you think about this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:23.600
time the romans had proclaimed a political peace&nbsp;
which means this they said it was peaceful times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.080
but the people of israel knew it&nbsp;
was not peaceable times so they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:34.400
looking for peace and so when the angels which&nbsp;
again it says don't be afraid right it's always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.120
every time an angel appears to somebody usually&nbsp;
the first statement they say is don't be afraid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.800
right but they know this is an important news&nbsp;
that they need to go respond to it quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:52.800
i started thinking through this how many times&nbsp;
do you wake up and you spend time with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.880
lord in the morning and you leave out of that time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:06.000
with important news that causes you to to respond&nbsp;
immediately that somebody one you need to go see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.720
how god's gonna respond in your life whatever&nbsp;
he taught you but two who needs to hear it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.440
maybe not enough and i was just challenged by that&nbsp;
as i began to think through how quickly they left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:24.800
right how quickly they left so as they went to&nbsp;
go see jesus um they obviously found him so i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.080
going to read these verses over again it says&nbsp;
when the angels had left them and returned to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.320
heaven the shepherd said to one another let's&nbsp;
go straight to bethlehem and see what happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.800
which the lord has made known to us and so&nbsp;
they heard often found both mary and joseph&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:44.320
and the baby line in the major so as we see&nbsp;
the praise and proclamation of the angels led&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:52.800
them to go see jesus how important is it for us to&nbsp;
continue to praise and proclaim jesus has arrived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:58.800
to bring peace to all people how important is&nbsp;
that anybody think that's important okay good i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.760
glad we're on the same page with that what do you&nbsp;
think would happen if we spent more of our lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.840
consistently praising and proclaiming christ to&nbsp;
those around us what do you think would happen

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:12.960
anybody

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:22.320
nothing would happen okay don't ever proclaim&nbsp;
christ then don't ever proclaim christ i think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.920
we've just decided that one no i i say this if if&nbsp;
we were proclaiming christ more so we're thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:34.320
from the angels perspective they proclaimed christ&nbsp;
was coming and it caused people to go see jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:42.160
simple fact that we learn from this if we proclaim&nbsp;
jesus has come to save people from their sins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.800
it will cause more people to come to see jesus&nbsp;
come to see jesus how important do you think that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:55.040
is by raising hands you think that's important yay&nbsp;
we're getting some responses here that's important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:02.880
to know the proclaiming christ's coming and giving&nbsp;
praise to god will cause people to see jesus go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.600
see jesus then now let's get real because you&nbsp;
guys are answering my question what stops you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:14.160
what is stopping you from telling people about&nbsp;
jesus then if you know if you proclaim christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.520
and you praise christ that people will go see&nbsp;
jesus what's stopping you let's be honest we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:28.320
love being real here at inspiring hope rejection&nbsp;
okay what's another one pride what's another one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:38.240
inconvenience great thank you for being honest&nbsp;
let's get two more what stops you busy busy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:46.480
okay that's two i'm only gonna take that as&nbsp;
one though so one more peer pressure okay so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:54.000
we all have excuses now let's work together i love&nbsp;
solving problems you know i'm not just here to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.680
preach i always tell people this my what i have to&nbsp;
share is a lot less important than what we have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.040
learn i'll say that again what i have to share is&nbsp;
a lot less important than what we have to learn so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.160
how do we overcome everything you&nbsp;
just shared how do we overcome

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.120
okay we as we spend time with jesus that's&nbsp;
great right it's gonna motivate us to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.400
overcome some of those things because&nbsp;
the word addresses every one of those

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.120
i'm gonna i'm gonna challenge you in this thought

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:31.680
if you guys saw fire coming out of your&nbsp;
neighbor's house how many of you by raise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:37.120
the hands would call 9-1-1 immediately and run&nbsp;
over there see if you can help great because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:43.040
you're so motivated that the need that they&nbsp;
have is immediate that you run and you call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.440
how we overcome everything that we're talking&nbsp;
about here is you see the message you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:56.080
received is so important and so immediate&nbsp;
that it drives you to forget anything else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.080
anything else that you can think that would&nbsp;
hold you back from sharing that message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:09.600
so amanda spoke about it right the more that we're&nbsp;
in the word that wells up in us to motivate us to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:16.000
overcome our pride and our busyness and the lack&nbsp;
of knowledge and the peer pressure and you name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.520
whatever else you said it overwhelms those things&nbsp;
and it says those things aren't excuses anymore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:27.200
because i see the house is on fire and i've&nbsp;
got to do something about it we've used this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:33.040
word before compassion jesus had compassion on&nbsp;
people which is this feeling inside that wells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:39.920
up so much you have to do something about it see&nbsp;
because the angels give us a great example that if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:47.280
we'll praise and proclaim christ that people will&nbsp;
go see jesus and as a church we desire to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:54.160
to challenge each other to go see&nbsp;
jesus so that others may go see jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.160
i don't want us to miss that part during&nbsp;
this season of praise we cannot neglect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.320
praising god and proclaiming to&nbsp;
them or him to those around us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.000
i pray if you haven't given your life to&nbsp;
jesus that our proclamation today of jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:17.840
will lead you to jesus but my hope is is that you&nbsp;
take this opportunity to invite this is the season&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.120
to invite people are more receptive to coming to&nbsp;
christ during this season than any other season&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:29.040
don't miss it don't miss it and after the season's&nbsp;
over don't wait for next season either okay but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:35.840
i'm saying right now today is important to make it&nbsp;
the season of inviting people to jesus so what did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.600
the angels praise lead those shepherds to do to&nbsp;
go see jesus but once they saw jesus the savior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.480
of the world had come right they saw it with&nbsp;
their eyes somebody tell me what did they go do

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.520
in the next couple of verses what&nbsp;
did they go do after they saw jesus

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:59.840
they rejoiced okay that's the last one so you're&nbsp;
getting there what happened in between there

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:06.080
we'll read it together it says they hurried off&nbsp;
okay actually let me verse 17. after seeing them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:12.320
they reported the message they were told&nbsp;
about this child and all who heard it were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.440
amazed at what the shepherds said to them so&nbsp;
they went and told others so they physically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.400
saw it with their own eyes they heard it&nbsp;
they went to go see jesus and then they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.440
shared that message with others it was&nbsp;
a natural transition they came to jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.040
and then they left others left to tell&nbsp;
others about what they had experienced

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.160
how many of you have received good news before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.440
or experienced a great event where you&nbsp;
couldn't wait to tell someone about it anybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.680
ever went okay give me a couple of those i know&nbsp;
we're getting you guys involved what's a couple of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.800
events that you've been to and experiences you've&nbsp;
had that you couldn't wait to go tell somebody go

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.480
getting engaged yes flaunt in the ring

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.040
what else

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.880
getting a new job that's another good one

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.360
anybody won the lottery i mean&nbsp;
that's a good one to go do

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.680
not yet okay but when you&nbsp;
do you make sure and call me

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:27.280
so i i say that to say this is is good news is&nbsp;
easy to share and it's one that you can't wait&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.920
to get on the phone to call somebody and tell&nbsp;
somebody and in this season of church planning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:37.520
for us there's been many times where something&nbsp;
cool will happen and like i'm just like running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.360
downstairs to tell bernie and she's in the middle&nbsp;
of school and she's like can you wait a minute i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.760
like no i've got to tell you this good news right&nbsp;
so it was good enough news for the shepherds as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:51.520
they saw jesus they went and saw jesus they had&nbsp;
to go tell people they had traveled a long way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:57.600
to experience jesus and they couldn't help but&nbsp;
share with others now i know what you're thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:04.160
if angels had come to you today and proclaimed a&nbsp;
message you might say it would be easy to go tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:09.280
people that message because angels appeared to me&nbsp;
right i don't know anybody that same way i mean if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:14.240
i don't know if you've ever said this before well&nbsp;
if god spoke to me audibly i'd listen to him every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.400
time well that's not true because we see that in&nbsp;
the old testament where they ignored him too so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:24.480
that's not a true statement so i started thinking&nbsp;
hebrews 13 2 says this it says don't neglect shown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:31.680
hospitality for by doing this some have welcomed&nbsp;
angels as guests without knowing it see many of us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:37.920
want an angel's experience but then many of us are&nbsp;
forgetting that angels could be arrested present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:44.160
around us all the time where again what is an&nbsp;
angel's role it's a messenger to his people it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:50.720
a minister to his people so i started thinking you&nbsp;
may have had angels in your life multiple times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:55.520
but maybe you've missed it so we can't use that&nbsp;
excuse anymore because i again that's i'm starting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.920
to think in this whenever i preach i preach&nbsp;
from the heart of going what if what's my excuse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.680
and so that was one of my excuses so&nbsp;
i couldn't couldn't use it anymore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.840
so i think we forget that god is working in our&nbsp;
lives in many ways to bring the truth of christ to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:16.080
us and to others but we don't recognize it and so&nbsp;
i started thinking about this this room you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.560
it's it's an emptier room than normal on a sunday&nbsp;
do you know that every person that's in this room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.120
and every person that's online is there for a&nbsp;
divine reason that god literally has you here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:30.480
for a reason and i started thinking about this a&nbsp;
couple of days ago hey when we read this message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.920
do you know that every one&nbsp;
of us has heard from an angel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:43.120
what are you talking about it says the angels&nbsp;
said that jesus had come to bring peace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:48.720
to all people you just heard from an angel you&nbsp;
can't say it anymore you can't say if i would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.320
you just did see i get really practical when i&nbsp;
read the bible because i start realizing this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.320
that whenever i say i wish god would speak to me&nbsp;
audibly all i have to do is read out loud i'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.800
say that again if you want god to speak to you&nbsp;
audibly open the word of god and read it out loud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:10.080
he just did see i'm telling you guys i'm there&nbsp;
with you i love the excuses and the reasons why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.400
the message may not be motivating enough to me to&nbsp;
go share with somebody well nope that's not there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:20.000
the the the god's not speaking to me audibly it's&nbsp;
not angels man i'm telling you guys we have every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.880
bit of those experiences that we have from the&nbsp;
bible so when we start working our way away from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:30.320
our excuses we start leaning into what we truly&nbsp;
do have right and what have i said i've preached&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:35.760
messages on this before the power of remembering&nbsp;
all that god has done for us and then all that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:41.760
god is doing presently to give us access to him&nbsp;
oh my gosh it's amazing what he has done right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.680
so over 2000 years ago god sent his son jesus to&nbsp;
this earth to live a perfect life so that we could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:54.720
one experience who god is in the flesh but also&nbsp;
to die in our place right so that we can have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:01.200
saving relationship with him to go tell others&nbsp;
to go tell others god is meeting with us today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:09.680
the story is not only about the shepherds&nbsp;
and the angels it's a message directly for us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:18.240
that god is using this story this story for you&nbsp;
to come to jesus and to go tell others about him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.680
for those of us i know that have given our&nbsp;
lives to jesus here's my challenge to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.200
share your testimony share what god&nbsp;
is doing in your life with others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:36.240
so that others may come to jesus don't miss&nbsp;
the opportunity don't miss it your testimony is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.920
not just your salvation i'm always reminded&nbsp;
of this it's not just your salvation story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:47.360
it's your daily story with jesus it's your&nbsp;
daily story with jesus and so these shepherds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:54.160
who were lowly who were one of the least of&nbsp;
the least were met by angels to tell them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.440
about jesus's coming and they went and saw&nbsp;
him and they were so impacted by the story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:04.400
that they went and told others to me it's&nbsp;
simple it's not complicated it's simple

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.520
so let's see what else the&nbsp;
angel said so the angels

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.920
by praising god right and proclaiming that&nbsp;
jesus was coming it led the shepherds to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.120
see jesus to go tell others and to go praise god&nbsp;
we see this in verse 20 it says this it says the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.920
shepherds return to glorify and praise god for&nbsp;
all the things they had seen and heard which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:35.840
were just as they had been told so ultimately it&nbsp;
led the shepherds to praise god too so as we said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:42.640
before the angels are god's servants there to help&nbsp;
fulfill god's plan to save people from their sins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.640
they fulfilled their role the angels fulfilled&nbsp;
their role and these shepherds gave praise to god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.880
because they had what they had seen and heard&nbsp;
so we see this based upon just walking through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:58.080
what the shepherds experienced they had a&nbsp;
changed life because of the angels doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:04.240
what god had called them to do see we we talk&nbsp;
about the body of christ which is all the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:09.440
that would be believers followers of jesus every&nbsp;
one of us has a role and when every one of us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.240
follows what god has called us to fulfill in the&nbsp;
role as the body of christ we'll start seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:21.520
changed lives that's the result i see the changed&nbsp;
life says is them giving praise to god not giving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.560
praise to themselves not giving glory that they&nbsp;
traveled all that way and that they were that hey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:32.000
you want my autograph i've seen jesus no that's&nbsp;
not what it was it was all praise to god for what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:39.840
god had done for them to them and to others and&nbsp;
for others it's similar to what mary was doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.280
and so we know that there's changed&nbsp;
lives whenever god uses people

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.000
so

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:54.640
let me ask you this question so we know that&nbsp;
the the shepherds lives were changed because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.240
they were praising god how can you know&nbsp;
that your life has been changed by god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:09.840
how do you know what's evidence in your life&nbsp;
that you know that you've been changed by god

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.400
okay so good luck or you see god's&nbsp;
blessing hand in your life okay

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.240
joy right joy is not based upon circumstances&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.280
but by the presence of god in the midst&nbsp;
of those circumstances that's good

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.200
i would say this if we're&nbsp;
consistently praising god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:41.280
as evidence of a changed life shepherds&nbsp;
was the last thing right it was evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.240
of a changed life that they had&nbsp;
been changed by the presence of god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:51.840
in this and so when we praise him we recognize our&nbsp;
need for him and not just about ourselves right

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:58.400
i'm going to challenge you with this as we we kind&nbsp;
of conclude here have you ever thought that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:06.320
only reason you're alive is because of what&nbsp;
god has done for you if you wonder is there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.320
a reason to praise god is there a reason&nbsp;
to share his message with other people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.000
um man what's god done for me lately i&nbsp;
don't know if you've ever been in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.840
pity party before what's god done for me lately um

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.120
in the last five seconds you've probably&nbsp;
taken three breaths it's from god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:32.320
and the last day you probably talked to&nbsp;
hugged a loved one spent time with some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:39.360
great friends and the last week you probably&nbsp;
have had a job that provided an income for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.360
your family and i could go on and on again&nbsp;
and you may say well it's because of me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:50.240
who who allowed you to be born and who created you&nbsp;
and who knit you in your mother's womb it was god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:56.000
and so i started thinking through&nbsp;
that how can we give god praise

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:03.920
whenever we feel like sometimes it's&nbsp;
tough and i'll challenge you with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:13.040
i've said this statement the other day that my&nbsp;
worst day as a follower of jesus is still better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:18.880
than my best day not following jesus&nbsp;
i'll say that again my worst day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:27.040
as a follower of jesus is still better than my&nbsp;
best day not following jesus how can i say that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:38.960
because god has changed my life because someone&nbsp;
shared that jesus had come to provide peace hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.920
joy salvation in my life and if that one person&nbsp;
and actually there was multiple people to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:51.440
me to that church to hear that message if those&nbsp;
people would not have heard a message from god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:52.880 --> 00:36:00.000
and shared it with me where would i be oh&nbsp;
my gosh guys this is a season of praise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:05.840
because not of only what god's done for you&nbsp;
me and not only for what god has done for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:13.840
but what god has done for everyone and may we&nbsp;
let mary's praise may we let the angel's praise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:22.560
lead us to go see jesus lead us to tell&nbsp;
others about him and lead us to praise him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.160
because he is good and worthy to be praised

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:33.920
because i don't want to miss an opportunity to&nbsp;
see one more person join me in the presence of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:42.480
god one day in eternity in heaven what&nbsp;
is stopping you from saying yes to jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:48.240
and you may say but i'm a believer what&nbsp;
is stopping you from saying yes to jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:55.920
in the next phase of your relationship with him&nbsp;
is it commitment to his church is a commitment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:01.440
to give is a commitment to invite i don't know&nbsp;
what it is only you know that i don't know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:07.200
but i know this that god is consistently&nbsp;
doing exceedingly abundantly more than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.320
we could ask or think according&nbsp;
to the power that works in us

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:19.760
if we surrender i'll go back to mary's praise&nbsp;
it says that mercy is given to those who fear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.920
the lord not fear as though we're scared but&nbsp;
fear and understanding is placed in our lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.800
so i don't know about you&nbsp;
where you're at in this season&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.360
but i know each of us should walk away to take&nbsp;
a next step so during this time of reflection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.480
we always have a time of reflection so here in a&nbsp;
minute brock's gonna lead us in some uh a song of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:45.440
worship this is time for you to just ask god this&nbsp;
question lord what did you teach me what did you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:53.520
teach me what are you speaking to me about through&nbsp;
this message for some of us it could just be to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:59.200
see jesus right to give your life to jesus and if&nbsp;
that's you i want to talk to you what it means to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.720
give your life to jesus every week i offer this up&nbsp;
i'm going to be back in the back because i want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.080
talk to you because it's so important for you to&nbsp;
give your life to jesus that's where it starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.360
to be able to give praise to god during the&nbsp;
season it starts with a relationship so please&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:19.520
come and talk to me for some of you you may be&nbsp;
sitting here convicted because you may be saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:27.440
i'm not motivated to share christ the way i&nbsp;
should i need to overcome that and this is for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:33.120
you to lay that down before the lord and the lord&nbsp;
say it's okay i knew because god knows everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:43.280
and to ask him to use you to be confident to share&nbsp;
with others the message that you've been given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:50.000
right the message of peace and hope and mercy the&nbsp;
last one is praise right guys during this season&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:56.960
it is easy to get distracted but my challenge&nbsp;
for you to refocus that you make it priority&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.360
to give god praise during this season and every&nbsp;
season of your life give him glory for every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:09.760
ability and everything you have and in response&nbsp;
if you do if you give god praise you will see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:15.120
change lives not only your life but in the&nbsp;
lives of those around you so i challenge you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:19.200
during this time to just ask the lord what it&nbsp;
is and the step you need to take and if i can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:25.120
be a part of helping you in that you let me know&nbsp;
so let's pray lord jesus we love you and lord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:31.920
we're thankful for your word and we're thankful&nbsp;
for the examples lord of mary and the examples&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:38.080
of the angels lord and how they praised you&nbsp;
because lord out of both of their praises

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:45.840
lord word challenges to us lord they're not&nbsp;
just opportunities to see something in your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:51.920
word and go man that was great they did that&nbsp;
but lord they're messages that are directly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:53.120 --> 00:40:02.560
written for us today in the season of celebrating&nbsp;
christ's birth or rather than getting distracted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.800
by every other thing that is going on in our&nbsp;
lives lord that doesn't have to do with you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:16.320
lord may we see that this is a season of praise oh&nbsp;
god you have done some amazing things in the lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:21.760
of your people and lord there you've done some&nbsp;
