00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.030
Well, good morning everybody.

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:12.509
I haven't got the opportunity to jump
up here and say Happy Mother's Day.

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:13.440
So Happy Mother's Day.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.050
To all the ladies in the room.

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.090
I always say at, at um, days like
today are a great time to remember.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.210
Um, especially the mothers who created us.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.000
And so mom, if you're watching,
cuz typically my mom and dad watch.

00:01:27.315 --> 00:01:28.095
Happy Mother's Day.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.155
Um, and then also my lovely wife.

00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:32.055
Happy Mother's Day to you.

00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:34.905
Thank you so much for all
you do for our kiddos.

00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:40.155
So, um, today is special for mothers and
I think today's message, interestingly

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:43.425
enough, even though we're continuing
our series, Shalom Shalom, which

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:44.655
is God's Perfect Peace, right?

00:01:44.655 --> 00:01:47.235
How do we find God's perfect peace
in the midst of our mental struggles?

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:50.655
I think worry is one of the
greatest topics to talk about

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:52.065
when we're talking about mothers.

00:01:52.285 --> 00:01:54.145
Uh, I think mothers worry the most.

00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:57.535
Doesn't any of the mothers here agree that
you guys tend to worry a little bit more?

00:01:57.555 --> 00:01:57.905
Never.

00:01:58.285 --> 00:01:58.705
Never.

00:01:58.735 --> 00:01:59.485
Okay, great.

00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:00.715
None of y'all gonna admit that.

00:02:01.345 --> 00:02:02.335
You can rip into that later.

00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:03.955
It's okay.

00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:10.134
Um, but I, I think worry is something that
actually all of us deal with, uh, and it's

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.325
one that most of us probably would not.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.090
Connect to like a mental struggle.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.940
We would just think, isn't
that just normal to worry?

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.630
And so we'll actually learn that
it's, it's normal to worry, yes.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.070
But it's also something that
should not cause us or, uh, to

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.870
be distracted or to cause um, us
to be consumed with these things.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.440
And so the last couple of things that
we've talked about the last couple weeks,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.460
technically, I guess we've been talking
about these mental struggles with anxiety.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.610
And depression.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.070
And so today we're gonna jump into worry.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.450
Um, and I would say this, most of us
probably worry about things like our

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.080
finances or our health or our family or
our jobs or what's going on in the world.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.110
Or you may even worry about what the
weather's gonna be tomorrow because

00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:57.190
it's gonna change all of your plans.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.360
Um, and so we worry sometimes with
the smallest things all the way

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.010
to some of the biggest things.

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:07.934
Here's a crazy statistic from the World
Health Organization, found that America,

00:03:08.445 --> 00:03:12.524
uh, Americans have bigger problems, uh,
are the biggest problem with worry than

00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:14.415
any other people in the world, right?

00:03:14.415 --> 00:03:18.345
Americans have the biggest problem
with worry than any other people

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:21.945
in the world, and it's crazy to
think about a society like us in

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.404
America that has way more things.

00:03:25.335 --> 00:03:28.335
Yet is the one that struggles
with worry the most.

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:31.845
Um, and I would say this,
uh, great, we won, right?

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:32.655
America, we won.

00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:35.085
That's probably not something
we wanna win at, uh, when it

00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:36.675
comes to, to something to win at.

00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:40.995
But I would say this many of us battle
with what we would call chronic worry,

00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:44.945
uh, something that continually is
on our mind and ever present, uh,

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.935
and it really takes our peace away.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.225
That's what we're talking
about here, right?

00:03:48.315 --> 00:03:48.795
Shalom.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.625
Shalom is God's perfect.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.540
Peace and worry is something that
still kills and destroys, um, our joy.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.600
And really even, I would say this,
sometimes worry will even prevent

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.299
us from spiritually growing the
way that God has called us to grow.

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.609
And so just, uh, raise their hands here.

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.230
Who here has worried before?

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.540
Yes, I've got everybody to raise their
hands for something because you would be

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.969
a straight up liar unless you're a newborn
baby that doesn't worry about anything.

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:18.825
Okay.

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:21.015
And I'm not calling newborn babies liars.

00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:21.734
I'm not gonna do that.

00:04:21.765 --> 00:04:22.005
Okay.

00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:23.505
But everybody else, okay.

00:04:23.775 --> 00:04:28.034
Uh, we've all worried at some point
in our life, uh, and Barner research

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:33.405
says that over 60% of adults in the US
struggle with worry and stress Daily.

00:04:33.455 --> 00:04:33.805
Daily.

00:04:34.784 --> 00:04:37.034
Uh, so what I would just say
with this, here's just a, a

00:04:37.034 --> 00:04:37.844
great way to look at this.

00:04:38.235 --> 00:04:39.164
Take half the room.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.530
This isn't quite divided,
but half this room.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.370
Let's just shift this side.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.990
60% of you are worried.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.440
It's you.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.370
You guys are great.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.420
You came in good.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.990
This side over here worries
and is stressed today.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.360
And no, that can be intermixed.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.540
But basically that's what we look
at in a room this size today.

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.390
You came in with stress and
worry on your minds and hearts.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.050
Isn't that crazy?

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.440
You came in that way and it
may not be crazy to you because

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.310
you deal with it every day.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.430
Um, but again, we talk about
if you're dealing with this

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.115
today, Then let's talk about it.

00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:10.965
How do we deal with, how
do we deal with our worry?

00:05:10.965 --> 00:05:12.285
Why do I always worry?

00:05:12.285 --> 00:05:14.715
And so we're gonna talk through this,
we're gonna use God's word to do

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:17.025
that, um, and, and talk more about it.

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.985
But I think when we think about
why we wor struggle and battle with

00:05:20.985 --> 00:05:24.195
worry, um, I, I think that it's
number one, it's gonna be crazy.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.995
You're gonna hear me
say this, but it's true.

00:05:26.745 --> 00:05:29.685
We battle with worry
because we're sinners.

00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:34.455
That, that may not sound really good to
you, but we're sinners, and lemme just

00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:39.345
explain this as sinners, which means this,
we're experiencing god's not god's best.

00:05:39.345 --> 00:05:42.465
I always communicate this, that sin is
not experiencing God's best for our life.

00:05:43.095 --> 00:05:47.745
Um, and that means that when we are
worrying, we're taking all of our life

00:05:47.775 --> 00:05:49.545
and all of our worries in our control.

00:05:49.755 --> 00:05:52.095
So worry is when we're trying
to figure out how to fix it.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.300
Trust and faith is when we trust
and put it all in God's hands.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.750
And so that's actually a sin when
we end up, uh, trying to control

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.159
things and do things on our own.

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:06.180
And again, it's taking life into our own
hands and that should not consume us.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.729
And we say again, that worry
is just part of our lives, but

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:10.510
it shouldn't be, but it is.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.409
Um, and a couple weeks ago when we
talked about anxiety, you may be

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:14.909
saying the same statement as well.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.479
Isn't worry and anxiety the same thing?

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.130
No.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.875
And here here's really
just the difference of it.

00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:25.965
Worry tends to be
experienced in our minds.

00:06:25.965 --> 00:06:30.375
It's something where we think on
it over and over and over again.

00:06:30.855 --> 00:06:33.525
Um, but anxiety we tend to
experience in our bodies.

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:35.565
It ends up actually
going and consuming us.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.245
And so I just wanna give
you a quick example here.

00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:39.585
Um, you may be worried that
you're gonna miss a flight.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.510
In the morning, if you're gonna go fly
somewhere, you're, you may be worried

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.370
you're gonna miss the flight, so you
wanna make sure you set your alarm

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.940
clock, but you may be anxious over
flying, which means it becomes something

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.300
that you can't hardly get on the plane
because you're so nervous and you're,

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:53.070
and it just begins to consume you.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.030
Um, and so again, worries a little bit
more specific and, and that, and so

00:06:57.034 --> 00:07:00.120
Matthew six today, if you wanna know where
we're going today, Matthew, chapter six,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.969
we're gonna be in verses 24 through 34.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.429
Um, this is where Jesus, and
I love this, Jesus addresses

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.770
worry and he says, don't worry.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.799
Um, and, and I love this because,
you know, there's sometimes I'm

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:16.650
reading in God's word and I'm
like, you know, is, is this true?

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.500
But whenever Jesus says something, it's
just like I lean in a little bit more.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.109
And today, I hope you
lean a little bit more.

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:23.849
So, uh, let's jump into this.

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:24.870
Matthew chapter six.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.359
We're gonna again read
TW verses 24 through 34.

00:07:27.359 --> 00:07:28.109
Here's what it says.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.520
It says, no one can serve two
masters since either he will hate

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.289
one and love the other, or he will be
devoted to one and despise the other.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.590
You cannot serve both God and money.

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:45.900
And then he says, therefore I tell
you, don't worry about your life, what

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.849
you will eat, what you will drink.

00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:50.445
Or about your body and what you will wear.

00:07:50.445 --> 00:07:52.604
Isn't life more than food?

00:07:52.695 --> 00:07:54.705
And isn't the body more than clothing?

00:07:55.245 --> 00:07:57.705
Consider the birds of the
air and birds of the sky.

00:07:58.125 --> 00:08:01.395
They don't sow or reap or
gather into Barnes, yet your

00:08:01.395 --> 00:08:02.685
heavenly father feeds them.

00:08:03.344 --> 00:08:06.436
Aren't you worth more
than they can any of you?

00:08:06.645 --> 00:08:09.435
Add one moment to his
lifespan by worrying.

00:08:09.435 --> 00:08:11.625
I want you to lean into that verse.

00:08:11.865 --> 00:08:16.185
Can any of you add one moment
to his lifespan by worrying?

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:19.364
Why do you worry about clothes?

00:08:19.364 --> 00:08:22.905
Observe how the wildflowers and
the field grows, don't they?

00:08:22.905 --> 00:08:26.835
Labor and spin thread yet I tell
you, not even Solomon in all of his

00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:28.635
splendor was adorned like one of these.

00:08:29.025 --> 00:08:32.505
And if that's how God closed the grass
of the field, which is here today

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.025
and thrown into the furnace tomorrow,
won't he much do much more for you?

00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:41.115
You of little faith, so don't worry
saying, what will we eat or what

00:08:41.115 --> 00:08:44.925
will we drink, or what will we
wear For the Gentiles eagerly seek

00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:48.824
all these things and your Heavenly
Father knows that you need them.

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:53.685
But seek first the kingdom of God and
his righteousness, and all of these

00:08:53.685 --> 00:08:55.005
things will be provided for you.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:09:00.105
Therefore, don't worry about tomorrow
because tomorrow will worry about itself.

00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:02.745
Each day has enough trouble of its own.

00:09:03.405 --> 00:09:04.035
So let's pray.

00:09:04.425 --> 00:09:06.405
Lord Jesus, we thank you
so much again for today.

00:09:06.405 --> 00:09:07.755
We thank you for bringing us here.

00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:10.829
On this special, uh,
mother's Day occasion.

00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:15.089
And Lord, as we begin to discuss
this topic of worry, I'm so thankful

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.170
that your word brings to light
how we can address this and how

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.359
we can continue to overcome worry.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.109
Because as we even know, Lord, there's
so many in this room that has walked

00:09:25.115 --> 00:09:26.949
into this room with worry and stress.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.190
Lord, I pray that you begin
to just renew their mind.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.010
You begin to, uh, help
them see a hope in you.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:36.640
And as they seek first you Lord,
that they will overcome that

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.110
worry, Lord, in their lives.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.120
And so, Lord, we just pray
this in your heaven name.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.230
Amen.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.060
So what?

00:09:43.905 --> 00:09:44.715
Not to worry about.

00:09:44.715 --> 00:09:44.925
Right.

00:09:44.925 --> 00:09:47.415
This is the first thing we're gonna
talk about is what not to worry about.

00:09:47.685 --> 00:09:51.435
Um, I actually grew up, um, with my
grandma, uh, would take, usually my

00:09:51.435 --> 00:09:54.405
grandma and grandpa would take us on
the weekends and, uh, usually the next,

00:09:54.465 --> 00:09:57.314
uh, Monday morning, they would take
us back to our parents and my grandma

00:09:57.319 --> 00:10:01.005
would take us in her van and originally
was in her Jeep, that she had been

00:10:01.005 --> 00:10:06.480
in her van and she would put on this
song, Called, don't worry, don't worry.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.430
A bee happy now.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.250
Ooh, okay, so you don't wanna
hear me sing anymore, right?

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.590
So we used to listen to this and
when she used to like pump the brakes

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.090
to this thing, like, we loved it.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.110
We loved it.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.590
And so as I'm preparing this
sermon, my mind goes back to those

00:10:19.595 --> 00:10:21.510
moments we're in those moments.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.130
We were having so much fun in the van.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:23.880
We didn't worry.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.530
We didn't worry about anything.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.800
And, and I look at this text
and I go, this is, I feel like

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.150
the Lord's singing to us today.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:31.260
Don't worry.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.770
Be happy now, again, that may sound
annoying to you because you don't

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.400
wanna worry and you wanna be happy.

00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:40.095
I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm telling you
the, the times that I've said that to

00:10:40.095 --> 00:10:41.685
myself, I don't wanna worry about this.

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:42.465
I wanna be happy.

00:10:42.465 --> 00:10:45.465
I wanna, you know, and, and Nate, I
think the Lord's gonna speak to us about

00:10:45.465 --> 00:10:49.425
what not to worry about, but then he's
gonna give us a help and a hope on what

00:10:49.485 --> 00:10:51.795
to overcome in the midst of our worry.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.066
And so the first thing he says, uh,
and that's why I read verse 24, because

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:59.325
that verse 25 says, therefore, he says,
don't worry about money, basically.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:10:59.655
Right?

00:10:59.775 --> 00:11:00.945
Or finances.

00:11:01.095 --> 00:11:03.165
And then he goes on and he
talks about, don't worry about.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.829
Basically your food or drink.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.560
Uh, and then he goes on and he says,
don't worry about your clothing.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.099
And then later on in verse 34, he
says, don't worry about your future.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.459
So as pastors, we do a great
job of kind of helping all

00:11:14.459 --> 00:11:15.300
of us remember these things.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.500
So here's what basically Jesus said, don't
worry about your finances, your food, your

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.449
fitness, your fashion, or your future.

00:11:21.469 --> 00:11:24.479
Don't worry about your finances,
your food, your fitness,

00:11:24.479 --> 00:11:25.979
your fashion, or your future.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.770
I'm pretty sure that covers pretty
much everything we deal with.

00:11:29.305 --> 00:11:30.780
Pretty much everything we deal with.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:35.370
And so what verse 25 says
is, it says, don't worry.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.020
So everybody say that with me.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.689
Everybody say, don't worry, don't worry.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.870
See, we need to remember these
things in God's word as we go about

00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:44.130
our lives, says, okay, don't worry.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.650
But what do we not worry about?

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.329
And then I'm just gonna kinda
walk through this pretty quickly

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.040
and kind of break this down.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.350
So again, he says, don't
worry about finances.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.329
Typically, we worry about finances
because we have a lack of finances.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.250
I've learned in life.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.670
You know, I've kind of lived a little
bit of, of life at this point in the,

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.990
the corporate world and, and in ministry
and in just taking care of my family.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:12.060
And I've learned the more money I make,
it seems like the more money I need.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.270
It seems like I can never get enough.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.260
Anybody ever feel that way?

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.710
And so I, I've, I've learned
after all these years, it's

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.920
taken years that Jesus is right.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.540
Hey, he's always right, but he's right.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.640
I'm, I'm, it's like I, I can't keep
worrying about finances, and I think

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.600
we typically lack finances, and
that's why we are worried about them.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.860
But some of us may make a lot of
money and we worry about how we

00:12:37.865 --> 00:12:41.430
should spend it or where we should
invest or what we should do with it.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.110
And then when we buy things, I mean,
I'm telling you, I know some people

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.210
that make like 10 times as much as
me, and they have all these boats in

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.710
these houses, and they're so stressed
out because they feel so consumed

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:53.790
by the things in which they have.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:54.900
So that may be you.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.550
And if it's you, hey, I
wanna ride on your boat.

00:12:56.819 --> 00:12:57.270
Call me.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.760
Um, I'll take care of that
for you for the weekend.

00:13:00.704 --> 00:13:02.145
Um, just joking.

00:13:02.805 --> 00:13:06.194
So these are obviously something that
we would worry about his finances,

00:13:06.194 --> 00:13:10.425
and so Jesus knows this, and so
it's a constant battle when we think

00:13:10.425 --> 00:13:12.495
about worrying about money, but
Jesus says, don't worry about it.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:12.824
Right?

00:13:13.035 --> 00:13:15.135
And then we see in verse 25,
he says, don't worry about your

00:13:15.135 --> 00:13:17.175
life, but then he gets really
specific with your life, right?

00:13:17.204 --> 00:13:18.865
He says, don't worry
about eating or drinking.

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:21.584
Really, if you want to think about
it, don't worry about your body.

00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:24.125
Uh, I use that word fitness and
some of you may be like, what?

00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:25.535
I don't ever worry about my fitness.

00:13:25.715 --> 00:13:27.755
Um, let's just think a
little bit about this.

00:13:27.755 --> 00:13:27.905
Okay.

00:13:27.905 --> 00:13:32.165
So for some, Jesus is speaking
to some who may be poor that are

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.335
worried about their next meal.

00:13:33.335 --> 00:13:37.175
So it makes sense, but what Jesus is
telling them, if I take care of the birds

00:13:37.385 --> 00:13:38.805
and I take care of the flowers, like.

00:13:40.035 --> 00:13:41.025
I'm gonna take care of you.

00:13:41.055 --> 00:13:42.435
You're my greatest creation.

00:13:42.435 --> 00:13:45.255
So he's telling them, those who
would worry about getting food or

00:13:45.255 --> 00:13:47.565
drink daily to not worry about it.

00:13:48.165 --> 00:13:51.015
But you know, and I think the funniest
thing is, is those of us that the

00:13:51.015 --> 00:13:53.865
biggest worries we have, especially
somebody, you're gonna deal with this

00:13:53.865 --> 00:13:55.365
today, you're gonna get in the car.

00:13:55.365 --> 00:13:58.225
And what's the question that
somebody's gonna ask you?

00:13:58.835 --> 00:14:00.495
Where do you want to eat?

00:14:01.065 --> 00:14:02.205
Where do you want to eat?

00:14:02.295 --> 00:14:03.915
And you know what they're gonna say, UR.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.120
And I'm gonna say, well,
I don't care either.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.239
Well then the next thing you know, 15
minutes later we're stressed out, worried,

00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:11.160
and in a fight and we're not talking.

00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:16.050
And when this happens,
text me say it happened.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:16.530
Okay?

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:22.319
So most of us worry about food
and drink in a different way, and

00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:26.131
it becomes this, don't wanna make
decisions and it stresses you out.

00:14:26.489 --> 00:14:29.819
And then it's just like, Oh man, it's
crazy that that's what we deal with,

00:14:29.819 --> 00:14:31.200
but that's exactly what we deal with.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.760
And so he is saying,
don't worry about this.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.060
Right.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.180
But I would even dive a little bit
deeper cuz sometimes we get consumed.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:40.020
Some people in my world, again, i I
I coach, uh, CrossFit, uh, during the

00:14:40.025 --> 00:14:43.319
week, some of the people I get around
is they get so consumed with eating

00:14:43.319 --> 00:14:44.500
the right things, their fitness.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.780
That they get so consumed by it, but
it seems like all day long they're like

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.540
thinking of these things and tracking
these things, and how many macros

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.860
am I eating and how much do I weigh?

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.040
And all of a sudden it consumes them that
they don't have enough or they're not

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.080
skinny enough or they're, you name it.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.580
And we become consumed with that.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.140
And it's not saying not to be healthy.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.270
That's not what Jesus is not
saying, but he's saying, Hey,

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.150
don't worry about those things.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.100
Um, and I've learned over time,
anybody ever done this before?

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.850
You go eat an expensive meal and
three hours later you're hungry.

00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:15.780
And I'm just like, it doesn't matter
what I eat, it really doesn't matter.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.910
Um, and so he says,
don't worry about that.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:22.440
Then he goes on in, in verse uh,
25, he says, don't worry about what

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.900
you will wear, what you will wear.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.310
Uh, anybody really focus on what you
wear specifically on Sunday mornings.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.230
I mean, like, do you ever
spend some extra time?

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.450
Ladies, you, you ever fix
your hair a little bit longer?

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.740
No, not, not James.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:35.700
He's good.

00:15:37.515 --> 00:15:39.375
I'm telling you though, it happens.

00:15:39.375 --> 00:15:40.875
Where this it, it's okay.

00:15:41.055 --> 00:15:41.895
Let me just tell you.

00:15:42.105 --> 00:15:42.765
I love this.

00:15:43.335 --> 00:15:45.225
I like wearing gray with gray.

00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:46.725
Britney's not in here.

00:15:46.785 --> 00:15:47.475
I don't know where she went.

00:15:47.565 --> 00:15:48.615
I like wearing gray with gray.

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:51.615
You know what she tells me every
time I put it on that does not match.

00:15:51.705 --> 00:15:53.115
I say it matches perfectly.

00:15:53.625 --> 00:15:54.645
She doesn't agree.

00:15:54.765 --> 00:15:56.345
So then I have to stress
about what I wear.

00:15:56.895 --> 00:15:58.545
I'm joking, but that's true though.

00:15:58.755 --> 00:16:01.965
I used to actually wear an orange
shirt with red pants and then

00:16:01.965 --> 00:16:04.095
that really was just not okay.

00:16:04.305 --> 00:16:07.845
But sometimes we get so consumed
with what we wear that it causes

00:16:07.845 --> 00:16:10.785
us to worry and stress because
we don't have the right clothes.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.845
And then all of a sudden, if we took
all the time, we focused on what we

00:16:13.845 --> 00:16:17.204
wore and spent that time with Jesus,
our lives would be transformed.

00:16:17.324 --> 00:16:18.675
I'm just taking a side note here.

00:16:18.975 --> 00:16:23.025
If we took all the time, we worried
about what we wore and exactly how we

00:16:23.025 --> 00:16:25.005
looked and folks said, all on Jesus.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.960
We could really be
transformed in our lives.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.350
So he is saying, again, don't
worry about our clothes.

00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:35.189
And then the last, in verse 34, he
says, don't worry about tomorrow.

00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:36.090
For tomorrow.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.500
Worries about itself.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:41.280
Anybody ever stress and
worry about the future?

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:41.939
Anybody?

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.500
I think so many of us do, right?

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.310
The future of what job am I gonna have?

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.270
Am I gonna have a job?

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.699
What are my kids gonna, you
know, are they gonna grow up

00:16:50.699 --> 00:16:51.600
and they're gonna love Jesus?

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.490
Are they gonna make the right decisions?

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:57.990
You know, all these different
future things that consume us,

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.410
we begin to worry about right
where we're gonna go to school.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.750
Uh, and Jesus addresses that.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:09.120
He says, do not worry about these things
because he says today has its own worries.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:09.420
Right?

00:17:09.425 --> 00:17:12.000
And he is the one that controls tomorrow.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:16.980
So to hear Jesus say, don't worry about
these things may kind of frustrate

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.650
you because you worry about them.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.920
I, I'm telling you these, these are
the things about the Bible that I.

00:17:23.474 --> 00:17:27.014
Get frustrated with, but then I
have to kind of reconcile with

00:17:27.075 --> 00:17:28.155
the things I get frustrated with.

00:17:28.155 --> 00:17:30.554
The Bible is when they contradict my life.

00:17:31.665 --> 00:17:32.925
Anybody, anybody.

00:17:32.925 --> 00:17:35.685
Maybe I'm the only one, but
I'm reading and I'm studying

00:17:35.745 --> 00:17:36.764
and God says, don't worry.

00:17:37.605 --> 00:17:38.355
And I'm like, but I do.

00:17:39.254 --> 00:17:39.915
What do I do?

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:42.196
And a lot of times we
don't know what to do.

00:17:42.435 --> 00:17:44.024
And that's what I love about the Bible.

00:17:44.145 --> 00:17:46.065
Usually it doesn't just say, don't worry.

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:49.725
God's giving you guidance
on how to overcome worry.

00:17:50.655 --> 00:17:52.740
And so, so, you know,
I'm the, the same way.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.680
So if you're saying, Hey, I walked in
here with worry and stress, I get it.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.290
Here's what I've learned recently.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.310
What I preach on, I tend to struggle
with within the weeks coming up to it.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.540
I told Brittany this last
week, next sermon series, I'm,

00:18:06.545 --> 00:18:07.680
I'm preaching on blessing.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.960
I just wanna be blessed, like that's it.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.330
Because it seems like over the
last couple weeks I've dealt with

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.100
anxiety, depression, and worry.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.330
I'm like, why?

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:16.980
And here's what I've learned.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.770
God's using it for the
benefit of those around me.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.350
And he's, he's asking me this
question like you asked me this week.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.150
He says, do you trust me here?

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.160
So let me just kind of
fill you in real quick.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.090
So last week if you were
here, I dealt with Arick neck.

00:18:30.225 --> 00:18:34.575
I dealt with my car breaking down
on Saturday and my hou my roof

00:18:34.575 --> 00:18:35.985
had a leak on Sunday morning.

00:18:36.705 --> 00:18:38.025
Uh, bad weekend.

00:18:38.085 --> 00:18:38.895
It's totally fine.

00:18:38.925 --> 00:18:40.065
Everybody has a bad weekend.

00:18:40.395 --> 00:18:43.005
I get my car, so I bring my car
and they fix something on Monday,

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.985
Tuesday, I get it out of the shop.

00:18:44.985 --> 00:18:47.025
The next day, Britney's
Transmission goes out.

00:18:48.105 --> 00:18:50.805
I mean, literally the next day,
Britt's transmission goes out.

00:18:50.805 --> 00:18:51.195
Gone.

00:18:52.425 --> 00:18:53.085
Well, great.

00:18:53.205 --> 00:18:56.145
We can't, we got a car that doesn't even
fit all of our family legally in it.

00:18:56.655 --> 00:18:57.254
Left.

00:18:57.855 --> 00:19:03.435
Uh, so anyways, I'm like starting
to worry and I'm literally preaching

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:05.475
on wor that, I mean, seriously,
the first thing comes to my mind.

00:19:05.475 --> 00:19:06.075
Great.

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:08.865
I've actually gotta
apply what I'm preaching.

00:19:09.135 --> 00:19:09.935
Like it's those moments.

00:19:10.245 --> 00:19:15.135
And then I ask this question in my mind,
why, why are we going through this?

00:19:16.185 --> 00:19:18.225
And I just realized God's saying this.

00:19:18.645 --> 00:19:19.784
Do you trust me here?

00:19:21.405 --> 00:19:22.785
Do you trust me here?

00:19:23.355 --> 00:19:26.625
Because I'm gonna, I'm just gonna, I
mean, it's, it's easy at times, like

00:19:26.805 --> 00:19:28.005
I've given my life to you, Jesus.

00:19:28.005 --> 00:19:33.585
I trust you with my salvation, but not
my job, not my family, not my future, not

00:19:33.585 --> 00:19:37.335
my health, not my life, but my salvation.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:37.755
I got you.

00:19:38.085 --> 00:19:38.746
I don't worry about that.

00:19:39.375 --> 00:19:41.115
But I'm gonna kick everything
else under control.

00:19:41.565 --> 00:19:45.405
And so that's where I felt like right
now, the Lord is, is challenging me.

00:19:45.405 --> 00:19:47.835
So if you're wondering, Hey,
do you struggle with worry?

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.585
Yes.

00:19:48.645 --> 00:19:53.145
And God is teaching me to trust him
even in the midst of some crazy things.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.315
So how do we respond?

00:19:54.315 --> 00:19:54.645
Right?

00:19:54.885 --> 00:19:55.995
There's too much to worry about.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.985
How do we respond?

00:19:57.435 --> 00:19:59.655
Um, and I would say, this is,
if I don't worry about it,

00:19:59.655 --> 00:20:00.585
who's gonna worry about it?

00:20:01.324 --> 00:20:04.949
And I realize that Jesus is the one
that doesn't even worry because he's

00:20:04.949 --> 00:20:06.360
already knows what's gonna happen.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.760
So let's gonna go on
to the next thing here.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.100
So now we say, what do we worry about?

00:20:11.129 --> 00:20:15.449
We already talked about that, how to not
worry, and it starts with remembering.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.219
Let's look at verse 26.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.150
So verse 26 says this,
um, I gotta get back here.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:22.620
Consider the birds of the sky.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.350
They don't sow or reap or
gather into Barnes yet your

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.790
heavenly father feeds them.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.710
Aren't you worth more than these?

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.980
And then he says, can any of you add
one moment to his life about worrying?

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.430
And then he goes on about, uh,
clothing and, and all these

00:20:35.435 --> 00:20:36.301
flowers and all these things.

00:20:36.306 --> 00:20:39.000
And so he says, consider this.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.460
And, and I'll just tell you
this, like, I like birds.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.530
But I feel like I'm pretty important
compared to birds and Jesus is backing

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.080
that up and, and it really just helps me.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.050
So we have to remember sometimes
if God is taking care of them,

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.540
won't he take care of me?

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.040
Won't he take care of my family?

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.600
Won't he take care of my health?

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.920
Won't he take care of the
relational issues that I'm

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.080
having with family or friends?

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:02.120
You name it.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.400
Whatever it is, you are
more worthy than that.

00:21:05.955 --> 00:21:09.735
And so we can learn to not worry
because we know that Jesus will

00:21:09.794 --> 00:21:13.665
always be and has always been a
provider in our times of needs.

00:21:14.415 --> 00:21:17.294
And, and I would look at this, sometimes
this timing may not be perfect for

00:21:17.294 --> 00:21:21.014
you and it's because sometimes we
don't see the perspective, and I'm

00:21:21.014 --> 00:21:22.665
remembering this over and over again.

00:21:23.235 --> 00:21:28.485
My perspective in life is
limited, my perspective in life.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.425
So just so you know right now,
I can see you guys' perspective.

00:21:31.455 --> 00:21:32.594
This is what I can see.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.565
But God sees everything.

00:21:35.625 --> 00:21:39.315
There are so many working parts in
this world, and he's working every

00:21:39.315 --> 00:21:42.795
one of them in such a way so that
not only he gets glory, but other

00:21:42.795 --> 00:21:45.735
people experience him in a unique way.

00:21:46.335 --> 00:21:49.065
And so sometimes the trials in what
you're going through, the things in which

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.365
you're worrying about is for something.

00:21:51.705 --> 00:21:54.465
It is preparing you or the
other person for something.

00:21:54.585 --> 00:21:59.385
It's allowing you, just like for us, in
that midst of the transmission, going

00:21:59.385 --> 00:22:01.875
out of God saying, do you trust me here?

00:22:02.235 --> 00:22:06.195
It's God asking that question because
it's constantly that loyalty idea.

00:22:06.585 --> 00:22:07.635
Do you trust me here?

00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:09.015
Do you trust me there?

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:12.345
And it's over and over again where we
go back to his word and we remember

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.375
if he provided for the birds, if he
provided for this, if he takes care

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:17.595
of that, then he'll take care of me.

00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:20.159
And it's interesting when
you think about birds.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.800
See, birds don't just sit
there and God provides for 'em.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:27.030
Birds actually have concern, Hey, I'm
hungry, and they go do something about it.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:30.750
Knowing that God will provide the food
for them or provide the nest for them.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.070
So I really wanna talk about two words.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.679
Number one, the difference
between concern and worry.

00:22:34.889 --> 00:22:39.450
Concern is focusing on challenges
and it moves you to action.

00:22:39.929 --> 00:22:42.450
So I would say this, if your
marriage is struggling, you

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.350
go to a marriage counseling.

00:22:43.649 --> 00:22:45.510
You don't sit there and
worry about your marriage.

00:22:45.689 --> 00:22:47.219
You go and you do something about it.

00:22:47.219 --> 00:22:50.699
Knowing that God wants to restore
that marriage, if we think about,

00:22:50.699 --> 00:22:54.629
Hey, I've gained 12 pounds, you don't
sit there and worry that you're gonna

00:22:54.629 --> 00:22:58.560
continue to gain weight, you're going
to recognize that and know that God can

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.100
help you make the right decisions to
eliminate some food and to choose the

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.480
right things to help you be healthy.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.149
So concern actually moves you to action.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.630
In faith, knowing that God has
provided a way to handle that

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:14.910
worry, but worry focuses on what's
beyond your control and the results.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.680
It results in inaction.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:17.550
So I'm gonna say this again.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:23.431
Worry focuses on what you cannot control,
and it causes you to inaction, right?

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.310
You begin to be consumed on it.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.240
So let me just give you this statement.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.910
It's stewing, overdoing, right?

00:23:29.915 --> 00:23:32.100
It's stewing over what you're
worrying about rather than

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.870
actually doing something with it.

00:23:33.875 --> 00:23:35.010
And that can be crippling.

00:23:35.535 --> 00:23:40.335
Worry can become crippling in our lives
where we become so consumed by him.

00:23:40.965 --> 00:23:45.765
And so he says this, can any one of you
add a moment to your life by worrying?

00:23:46.305 --> 00:23:49.215
So in other words, has
anyone ever gotten better?

00:23:49.725 --> 00:23:51.615
Like anything ever gotten
better about worrying?

00:23:51.615 --> 00:23:53.716
Like if you worried on it,
did, did life get better?

00:23:54.085 --> 00:23:54.575
Anybody?

00:23:56.205 --> 00:23:56.775
No.

00:23:56.775 --> 00:24:02.445
100% of the time when you worry, it
actually distracts you from being able to

00:24:02.445 --> 00:24:03.945
overcome whatever you're worried about.

00:24:04.455 --> 00:24:06.135
Let me, let me just share this with you.

00:24:06.165 --> 00:24:14.445
100% of the time when you worry, you
will not have peace 1% of the time.

00:24:15.524 --> 00:24:19.335
I, I like the odds of this idea of
sitting here thinking if I worry something

00:24:19.335 --> 00:24:25.004
may come true, but if I don't worry
1% of the time, I don't have to worry.

00:24:25.004 --> 00:24:26.225
Like it, it's God's gotta taken care of.

00:24:26.504 --> 00:24:28.305
It's, it's not going to hold me back.

00:24:28.575 --> 00:24:30.615
And I think that is so
important to remember.

00:24:30.885 --> 00:24:32.505
That God is in control.

00:24:32.565 --> 00:24:35.505
He is the one that says that he
provides for the birds of the air.

00:24:35.535 --> 00:24:37.875
He'll provide for each one of us.

00:24:38.175 --> 00:24:41.505
And so you may not have a password
God has provided for you, but here,

00:24:41.625 --> 00:24:43.125
let me just remind you of this.

00:24:43.245 --> 00:24:48.465
A lot of times when something tragic
happens, and I keep using our cars as

00:24:48.465 --> 00:24:52.125
an example, but it could be loss of a
love one, it could be something else.

00:24:52.635 --> 00:24:59.490
But when something happens where you begin
to worry, We end up getting so consumed

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.590
with, well, where's God at in this?

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.150
Where's God at in this?

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.470
And we forget all the time before when you
didn't have anything to worry about how

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:12.960
God had provided every day he was there
every day, he provided life every day.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.710
He provided for every instance
that you used to worry

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.980
about, he provided every day.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.600
But the moment that we begin to lose a
transmission or begin to have struggles

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.495
with other family members, the moment
that we do that, And we see that.

00:25:24.495 --> 00:25:25.605
We wonder, where's God at?

00:25:25.665 --> 00:25:26.115
Where's God at?

00:25:26.175 --> 00:25:27.255
He's always been there.

00:25:27.285 --> 00:25:31.275
He's with you in the midst of
worry and he says, don't worry,

00:25:31.845 --> 00:25:32.775
I've got it taken care of.

00:25:32.775 --> 00:25:33.495
Don't worry.

00:25:33.495 --> 00:25:37.155
Trust me in this relationship that you're
having to struggle with, whatever you're

00:25:37.155 --> 00:25:39.645
struggling with, God says, don't worry.

00:25:40.545 --> 00:25:43.245
And so if God's gonna take care
of the birds of the ear again, how

00:25:43.245 --> 00:25:44.655
much more will he take care of you?

00:25:45.135 --> 00:25:48.795
And so when we are saying that, we
worry, this is a hard statement, but we

00:25:48.795 --> 00:25:50.505
need to hear this when we say we worry.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:54.330
When we do worry, we're actually
saying, God, I don't trust you.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:55.919
God, I don't trust you.

00:25:56.129 --> 00:25:57.240
I don't trust your plan.

00:25:57.419 --> 00:25:58.680
I don't believe you're for me.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:25:59.700
I don't believe you're good.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:05.340
And that, that's hard for me to say, uh,
because I want to be like, no, but I do.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.620
But when I worry, I'm
actually saying I don't.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.590
And so this is a statement I've
shared before, but what we worry

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.430
about most reveals where you trust God
the least, I'm gonna say this again.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:19.379
What you worry about most is
where you trust God the least.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:23.925
And so again, if you think,
you know, I'm judging you, I, I

00:26:23.925 --> 00:26:25.004
struggle with that same thing.

00:26:25.275 --> 00:26:28.695
And that's why I tell you there's
those moments in life when things

00:26:28.695 --> 00:26:33.345
come reigning in and you're
like, oh man, what am I gonna do?

00:26:33.345 --> 00:26:34.245
And how are we gonna handle this?

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.925
And what are we gonna, how
are we gonna overcome this?

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.605
All this worry comes in on my life.

00:26:37.695 --> 00:26:40.395
I have to go back to
and remember God's word.

00:26:40.935 --> 00:26:45.555
I have to go back because it's easy
to hang out and worry the what ifs.

00:26:47.219 --> 00:26:49.199
But God says that he'll take care of us.

00:26:49.199 --> 00:26:52.110
And what I think is so important with this
is just like with the birds of ver, cuz I

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.730
think we have to keep thinking about this.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:58.709
They don't worry about food because
they know God has prepared it for 'em.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:02.699
Even if they have to search a
little longer, even if they have

00:27:02.699 --> 00:27:04.590
to search a little longer, they
know it's going to be there.

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:09.060
So for us, at times, in the midst
of our worry, we have to have in

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.540
faith, know that God is going to
provide a way out, a way to overcome.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:16.800
It may take a little bit
longer, and that's in his timing

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.540
because he knows what you need.

00:27:19.379 --> 00:27:21.540
So right where you're sitting, I
want you to just begin to think

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.700
about what you've worried about.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.740
And the reason why I want you,
I'm preparing your hearts.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:28.080
I want you to begin to think about
what you've been worrying about lately.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.770
Maybe it's a relationship
that has gone astray.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.889
Maybe it's a, a child
that you're worried about.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.930
Um, maybe it's your marriage.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.200
Um, maybe it's your health or your job.

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:42.525
Maybe you, you fill in the blank.

00:27:42.525 --> 00:27:44.145
Be begin to be thinking about that.

00:27:44.145 --> 00:27:46.995
Because what will happen in
days like today is you'll say,

00:27:46.995 --> 00:27:48.615
Hey, this is a great message.

00:27:49.065 --> 00:27:52.065
Um, and then you're gonna walk out
and then tomorrow morning you're gonna

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.505
worry and you're gonna forget that.

00:27:53.895 --> 00:27:56.595
So as you begin to think about worry
today, you're gonna get an opportunity

00:27:56.595 --> 00:27:58.005
to cast that over to the Lord.

00:27:58.485 --> 00:28:02.565
And so once we've identified what we've
worried about, what are we supposed to do?

00:28:02.625 --> 00:28:03.465
That's always the question.

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:03.975
Okay.

00:28:03.975 --> 00:28:07.425
I, I'm worried, what do I do with it?

00:28:07.814 --> 00:28:08.925
What do I do?

00:28:08.985 --> 00:28:10.784
And this is where we look at verse 33.

00:28:11.385 --> 00:28:12.314
Verse 33.

00:28:12.435 --> 00:28:14.145
Well actually, actually
it's 31 through 33.

00:28:14.145 --> 00:28:15.135
Let's look at this together.

00:28:15.495 --> 00:28:17.205
He says, don't worry.

00:28:17.235 --> 00:28:17.895
So don't worry.

00:28:17.899 --> 00:28:21.405
What, what you will eat or
what you will drink, or what

00:28:21.405 --> 00:28:23.534
we'll wear for the Gentiles.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.844
And really what he's saying,
Gentiles says, unbelievers.

00:28:26.764 --> 00:28:31.455
So people who don't know Jesus, Worry
about these things, but if you came

00:28:31.455 --> 00:28:34.274
into this room and know Jesus, or if
you haven't given your life to Jesus and

00:28:34.274 --> 00:28:37.905
you want to, if you have a relationship
with Jesus, he says, then you don't

00:28:37.905 --> 00:28:38.835
need to worry about these things.

00:28:38.835 --> 00:28:42.524
He says, the Gentiles eagerly seek these
things and your heavenly Father knows

00:28:42.524 --> 00:28:47.355
you need them, but seek first the kingdom
of God and his righteousness, and all of

00:28:47.385 --> 00:28:48.735
these things will be provided for you.

00:28:49.665 --> 00:28:52.905
I underlined the word all because
there, you know, it's those moments

00:28:52.905 --> 00:28:54.315
where I'm like, well, sometimes, right?

00:28:54.345 --> 00:28:55.875
No, he says All.

00:28:56.729 --> 00:28:57.780
Will be provided for you.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:01.949
Does this mean that we're gonna be poured
out blessing where we now have $10,000

00:29:01.949 --> 00:29:03.270
in our bank account whenever we go home?

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.010
Probably not.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.330
That's not what he's saying.

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:10.020
That if I just seek firstly Kingdom,
my Godd, my, you know, credit score's

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.129
gonna go up and my family's gonna come
over and say, Hey, I am totally wrong.

00:29:13.439 --> 00:29:17.639
I, you know, that, that may
happen, it could, that's not

00:29:17.639 --> 00:29:18.689
exactly what he's saying.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:21.360
And my neck thing is
just totally twisted now.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.719
Um, sorry, side note.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:29.850
So whenever you're worried, whenever
you're consumed with, with whatever

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.180
you're stressed about, he says
to seek first the kingdom of God.

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:38.400
So when I ask this question
is, are you seeking first God?

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.040
I mean, I, I think that's the simple part.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.750
Today, if we wanna talk
about this, I worry.

00:29:42.755 --> 00:29:43.660
And I don't know how to overcome worry.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:45.360
What do I do?

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.340
Seek first God?

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.800
Now the question is, are you?

00:29:50.895 --> 00:29:54.405
For those of you that walked in this
room, you may say, I walked in and I've

00:29:54.405 --> 00:29:56.565
been a believer of Jesus for 27 years.

00:29:56.955 --> 00:29:58.695
50 years, one month.

00:29:59.085 --> 00:29:59.595
Yeah.

00:30:00.195 --> 00:30:01.455
I put God first in my life.

00:30:02.985 --> 00:30:05.774
But do you, do I?

00:30:06.435 --> 00:30:09.195
I mean, in writing this message,
I had to truly ask that question.

00:30:09.435 --> 00:30:11.956
Seek first the kingdom of God.

00:30:12.615 --> 00:30:12.975
You know what?

00:30:12.975 --> 00:30:14.445
Wanna know what a lot
of my days look like?

00:30:14.685 --> 00:30:17.774
I'm like rolling outta bed, running late.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:21.555
And I'm rushing to get in the
shower and put on the right

00:30:21.555 --> 00:30:23.655
clothes because they didn't match.

00:30:24.075 --> 00:30:28.485
And I'm hungry, so I gotta get food or
I've gotta stop by somewhere and get food,

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.135
which is gonna make me late for work.

00:30:30.345 --> 00:30:34.065
And all of a sudden my day's
gone on and I'm seeking first

00:30:34.455 --> 00:30:39.335
food, water, what I'm wearing.

00:30:40.725 --> 00:30:42.285
Does that sound familiar to you?

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:43.980
Does anybody else do that?

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:48.300
Because we're so consumed with seeking
First what we have going on in our

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:54.149
lives, which causes the worry, and so in
saying, seek first the kingdom of God.

00:30:54.155 --> 00:30:58.909
Seek first Jesus, when you
wake up, seek first Jesus.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.710
When you have a worry
or a care in your life.

00:31:02.294 --> 00:31:05.355
Where do you go whenever
something goes wrong in your life,

00:31:05.355 --> 00:31:06.405
where it causes you to worry?

00:31:06.585 --> 00:31:09.195
Do you go to God or do you try to fix it?

00:31:09.524 --> 00:31:13.725
Do you go to God or do you stew on it and
begin to be frustrated and consumed by it?

00:31:14.385 --> 00:31:17.475
That's the question that he's asking
today, that he's asking us, do

00:31:17.475 --> 00:31:20.185
you put your trust in Jesus or do
you put your trust in Jesus last?

00:31:20.715 --> 00:31:23.955
I mean, trust me, I, I'm, I love
having things in my control.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.034
I love, that's just me.

00:31:25.034 --> 00:31:25.965
I'm a control person.

00:31:27.209 --> 00:31:30.435
But typically, so something happens and
I'm like, I wanna control the situation.

00:31:30.705 --> 00:31:33.885
And then whenever it finally I
can't, that's when I go to God

00:31:34.935 --> 00:31:37.185
and he's saying, whoa, whoa,
whoa, you got that out of place.

00:31:38.145 --> 00:31:43.334
Seek first the kingdom of God, knowing
that he will lead you and guide you.

00:31:43.334 --> 00:31:48.225
And as you seek God, he will lead you in
the direction to control, not control,

00:31:48.524 --> 00:31:52.514
but to lead you to help the situation
or to walk through the situation.

00:31:53.295 --> 00:31:56.625
So we seeking, saying, seek first
the kingdom of God above all.

00:31:56.865 --> 00:31:58.275
And I say this over and over again.

00:31:58.275 --> 00:32:02.805
It's not about just seeking
Jesus, it's about saying, saying

00:32:02.805 --> 00:32:04.865
no to worry and seeking Jesus.

00:32:05.445 --> 00:32:07.185
Sometimes we just keep
saying, I shouldn't worry.

00:32:07.185 --> 00:32:07.785
I shouldn't worry.

00:32:07.785 --> 00:32:08.415
I shouldn't worry.

00:32:08.445 --> 00:32:10.425
And all I'm doing is
worrying about worrying.

00:32:11.775 --> 00:32:14.865
So it's saying I shouldn't
worry because God's word says

00:32:14.865 --> 00:32:16.245
seek first the kingdom of God.

00:32:16.245 --> 00:32:18.885
So I'm saying no to worry
and I'm saying yes to Jesus.

00:32:19.665 --> 00:32:21.765
It's two parts.

00:32:22.379 --> 00:32:24.270
Two parts when we look at this.

00:32:25.139 --> 00:32:28.919
So some of you may have just come to the
realization of the biggest problem with

00:32:28.919 --> 00:32:33.540
your worry is that you've never really
sought Jesus or you gave your life to

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:36.669
Jesus and you have him at number three.

00:32:37.379 --> 00:32:39.750
Or if you're anything like me, sometimes
I put him at number 10 and I never

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:44.490
get past seven in my daily tasks or
my daily process, or my daily times of

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.919
worrying, and I've already done seven
other things to try to fix this worry,

00:32:46.919 --> 00:32:48.540
and God's ate and I didn't get there.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.820
Some of you may have realized that today.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:57.375
And it's upon us to move and to cry
out to God and to ask him to help us.

00:32:58.215 --> 00:33:02.565
So the question is, is this is if
I put my hope and trust in Jesus to

00:33:02.565 --> 00:33:05.895
take care of what I'm worried about,
what's going to happen to worry?

00:33:06.165 --> 00:33:07.215
What's going to happen to worry?

00:33:07.335 --> 00:33:09.675
I wanna give you three things
before we head into imitation.

00:33:09.675 --> 00:33:14.355
Three things that will happen
when you worry Number one.

00:33:15.179 --> 00:33:18.030
When you begin to do a little bit
of research, Penn State actually

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:19.139
did this research, and I love this.

00:33:19.139 --> 00:33:20.159
You'll see this in your notes.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:23.820
They did some research, uh, over about a
month period where people wrote down all

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.929
the things that they were worried about.

00:33:24.929 --> 00:33:26.760
And after 30 days, how
many of them came true?

00:33:27.659 --> 00:33:31.350
And I think it's around 91% of the things
that they worried about never came true.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:35.939
So if we take that statistic and
we think about this, when you worry

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.899
nine outta 10 times, whatever you're
worried about will never come true.

00:33:43.095 --> 00:33:45.975
I think that's like, like that's,
that's something to think about this.

00:33:46.095 --> 00:33:49.275
So your worry though will rob
you of peace 100% of the time.

00:33:49.365 --> 00:33:50.685
Kind of going back to that same statistic.

00:33:51.585 --> 00:33:54.795
So when we worry 90% of the
time, it won't come true.

00:33:55.485 --> 00:33:59.295
So then it goes on a little
bit and it says this the other

00:33:59.295 --> 00:34:00.555
times what's gonna happen?

00:34:00.585 --> 00:34:02.685
Well, sometimes it doesn't
happen as bad as we thought.

00:34:02.805 --> 00:34:04.665
You ever worry you're gonna fail a test?

00:34:04.755 --> 00:34:05.535
I did that in college.

00:34:05.745 --> 00:34:06.525
I'm gonna fail a test.

00:34:06.525 --> 00:34:07.845
And I got like a 75.

00:34:08.175 --> 00:34:08.775
I didn't fail.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.840
You ever think that you know, your
marriage is gonna fall a bar completely

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.130
and we're gonna get a divorce?

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.400
No.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.890
You just fought for a day
and the next day yet made up.

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:20.790
I mean, sometimes we worry and
consume ourselves so much and

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:23.040
it ends up just not being as bad
as we thought it was gonna be.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.170
Not as bad as we thought it was gonna be.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:28.201
So that's another alternative to
what can happen, right when we worry.

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.750
But the last one, and here's
one that I think is the most

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:36.270
difficult, what we worry about may
happen, but here's the cool part.

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.610
God will get us through
it 100% of the time.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:45.240
See, if we don't worry about it, we can
now have peace, God's perfect peace.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.660
But when we worry about it, we're
guaranteed to lose 100% of our

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.460
peace because we've lost that.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:54.150
But statistics will tell you
here that odds are the things we

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:55.560
worry about will not come true.

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.720
And even if they do, God will
get you through those things.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:34:59.560
So.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.940
So what's our response to this?

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:03.330
Right.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.635
For some of us in this room, the
things we worry about, I, I can't even

00:35:07.635 --> 00:35:08.805
imagine what you're worrying about.

00:35:08.835 --> 00:35:10.695
It could really be some tragic things.

00:35:11.475 --> 00:35:14.715
It could be some deep things that,
this sounds too simple to you, that

00:35:14.715 --> 00:35:17.655
if you seek first the kingdom of
God, that he'll just take care of it.

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:18.465
It's that simple.

00:35:18.945 --> 00:35:22.615
No, it's something that I would
say this, I would add this in, and

00:35:22.615 --> 00:35:24.195
this is not me adding to the Bible.

00:35:24.195 --> 00:35:25.545
I believe this is what Jesus is saying.

00:35:25.815 --> 00:35:28.425
Seek first the kingdom of God every day.

00:35:29.355 --> 00:35:31.935
This is not a one-time decision,
and I'll even say this, sometimes

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.285
it seek first the kingdom of God.

00:35:33.805 --> 00:35:39.270
Every moment because we can't just
today, and this is my challenge to

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:42.180
you during invitation, it's always
the time to respond and begin to seek

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.160
the Lord and and cast off our worries.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:45.810
But you may do that on Sunday.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.350
But Monday's coming and
everybody knows what Monday is.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.240
Mondays are Mondays.

00:35:51.245 --> 00:35:54.900
Everybody had a Monday before and a
Tuesday and a Wednesday and a Thursday

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.170
and a Friday and a Saturday and a Sunday
and another, it's all back around again.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:58.470
Okay?

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:03.270
So what we take today is
important to apply every day.

00:36:03.795 --> 00:36:06.915
And every moment to keep this
in the front of our minds to

00:36:06.915 --> 00:36:08.595
seek first thinking of, of God.

00:36:09.315 --> 00:36:11.685
Here's the thing, uh, I understand.

00:36:11.895 --> 00:36:15.674
Um, when you look at this and you,
you think about, uh, taking your

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:21.765
worry to God, um, what you're worried
about is so difficult that it's

00:36:21.765 --> 00:36:23.904
hard to do that, but I think Jesus.

00:36:25.375 --> 00:36:28.484
We will continue to remind you every
day that you seek him that he is better

00:36:28.544 --> 00:36:29.955
than whatever you'll worry about.

00:36:30.044 --> 00:36:33.555
He is way better than whatever
is consuming your life.

00:36:34.334 --> 00:36:41.145
And so I know this is, that worry has
sucked the joy outta my life at times.

00:36:41.564 --> 00:36:45.194
And I have, I've just come to the
conclusion recently and the last, this

00:36:45.194 --> 00:36:48.404
really this year, and this sounds so
crazy, you've been a pastor for how long?

00:36:48.555 --> 00:36:50.865
But it's this year that
this is my statement.

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:51.884
It's fine.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:58.350
There has been so much that's happened
in the last year, and I'm just like,

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:02.520
I'm tired of emotionally going down
and then having this roller coaster

00:37:02.525 --> 00:37:06.060
emotion up and then smaller roller
coaster down because of worry and

00:37:06.065 --> 00:37:08.190
stress and anxiety and depress.

00:37:08.195 --> 00:37:10.890
I'm done with it, and so you know
what it is When something happens

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.080
that I could worry about, it's fine.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.120
It's fine.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:20.130
And the reason why it's fine
is because God is not surprised

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:21.180
by what I'm going through.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.910
God's not surprised by
what you're going through.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.299
We live in a sinful and broken
world and it is difficult.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:29.549
But you know where he said this?

00:37:29.549 --> 00:37:33.390
He says, the Gentiles seek these
things and worry about these things.

00:37:33.629 --> 00:37:36.180
And when I said the Gentiles, it is
the unbelievers people that don't know

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:39.600
Jesus and, and we should be broken
over people that don't know Jesus, who

00:37:39.605 --> 00:37:44.129
worry and are consumed that when things
happen, they have nobody to go to.

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:51.194
But as a believer, As a father of
Jesus, we have him and we know he

00:37:51.194 --> 00:37:54.855
is in control, and he's saying,
don't worry about your finances.

00:37:54.855 --> 00:37:57.345
Don't worry about your food
or your fitness or your body.

00:37:57.345 --> 00:37:58.935
Don't worry about your future.

00:37:59.294 --> 00:38:02.774
Whatever it is that you're worrying about,
he says to seek first the kingdom of God.

00:38:02.835 --> 00:38:08.805
I wanna challenge you to do that today
in this time of invitation, and I want

00:38:08.805 --> 00:38:12.734
you to also just, maybe you need to say
the statement that I said this week.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.990
If you're worried about something,
you need to ask the Lord this

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:18.240
question, do I trust you here?

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.510
And maybe that's what the Lord's saying.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.240
Wherever worry, you're worrying
about, he has seen this.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.060
Do you trust me here in this
relationship that's broken?

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.270
Do you trust me here in the future
of your life and your family?

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:37.290
And maybe today you lay down and you
say, I believe, but help my unbelief.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:42.060
That is a hard statement because
sometimes it's hard to say that you trust.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.520
Jesus.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:44.910
So let's pray.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:46.770
Lord Jesus, we thank you Lord for today.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:52.440
We thank you that your,
your word is truth.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.940
And when we know that your
word is truth, we can read it.

00:38:57.509 --> 00:38:59.940
We can believe it in faith,
and we can experience it.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:03.420
So today your word says, don't worry.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:05.250
Your word says, don't worry.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:13.050
And Lord, I know right now across this
room, you're filling in the blank of

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.540
whatever everyone's worrying about.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.370
And so, Lord, as they are thinking
about those things, Lord, I pray that

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.770
right now as we continue to pray.

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:26.190
Lord, I pray that they are casting
their cares on you, that they

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:29.310
are taking those worries and that
they're handing them over to you.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.280
That they're laying them down
and they're saying, Lord, I

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.570
don't wanna worry about this.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:36.480
I don't wanna worry about
my child or my marriage.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.870
I don't wanna worry about
my finances or my cars.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:41.160
I don't wanna worry about my job.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:44.910
I don't wanna worry about
my future and the unknown.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:50.730
Whatever it is, I'm, I'm challenging
all of you in this room to just begin

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:54.450
to pray and to lay those things down at
Jesus' feet and say, I don't wanna worry.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:56.550
I don't wanna worry.

00:39:58.785 --> 00:40:03.765
Just take a few minutes right now and
just begin to ask the Lord to take that

00:40:03.765 --> 00:40:04.935
worry from your heart and your mind

00:40:23.205 --> 00:40:24.265
as we continue to pray.

00:40:24.285 --> 00:40:26.265
Here's what I wanna
challenge you to do now.

00:40:26.825 --> 00:40:32.295
I, I challenge you to now say this, Lord,
I've cast my worry, whatever I'm worried

00:40:32.295 --> 00:40:38.504
about, down to you, and I'm picking up,
seeking you first in that area, seeking

00:40:38.504 --> 00:40:41.924
you first in my marriage, seeking you
first in my finances, seeking you first in

00:40:41.924 --> 00:40:45.654
broken relationships, seeking you first in
my future and in my job that I'm worried

00:40:45.944 --> 00:40:48.045
about or my family member or my child.

00:40:49.305 --> 00:40:52.275
Just begin to, to pray and
tell the Lord right now.

00:40:52.875 --> 00:40:54.285
Lord, I'm seeking you first here.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:00.240
I am placing you in the right place, not
second, not third, not after I figured

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.830
it out, but Lord, I'm seeking you first.

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:04.080
And so just take a few moments
to, to tell the Lord you're

00:41:04.085 --> 00:41:06.210
seeking him first in those areas.

00:41:30.045 --> 00:41:32.955
The last thing is we continue
to just seek the Lord.

00:41:36.015 --> 00:41:39.015
I know there could be people in
this room that have never sought

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:44.235
Jesus first ever, which means you've
never put your faith in Jesus.

00:41:45.615 --> 00:41:49.395
My pastor reminded me this so many
times before I gave my life to Jesus.

00:41:49.395 --> 00:41:52.065
There's never a better day to give
your life to Jesus than today.

00:41:52.395 --> 00:41:55.305
There's never a better day than to
give your life to Jesus than today.

00:41:56.715 --> 00:41:59.654
And so my challenge is, is if you
heard this message and you struggle

00:41:59.654 --> 00:42:02.895
with not only worry, but you struggle
with just not having a relationship

00:42:02.895 --> 00:42:06.285
with Jesus, you don't even know what
that is, that you came in this room

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:10.485
as an believer that today you can
seek first God for the first time.

00:42:11.505 --> 00:42:14.775
And so if you would like to give your life
to Jesus, if you would like to seek first.

00:42:15.045 --> 00:42:16.665
Jesus today, you can do that.

00:42:17.325 --> 00:42:20.415
I'm just gonna encourage you to raise
your hand, to raise your hand, to

00:42:20.415 --> 00:42:24.134
commit that you wanna give your life
to Jesus, that you wanna put him

00:42:24.134 --> 00:42:27.105
first in your life because you've
never done that in your life before.

00:42:27.585 --> 00:42:31.065
Today is an opportunity to stand boldly
to say you wanna give your life to Jesus.

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:49.710
I wanna encourage you, every one of
you are professing that you believe in

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:54.120
Jesus and that you trust him and that
you want to put him first in your life.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:43:00.660
So today, remember to take what
you've learned from God's word and

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:04.150
not only apply it today, but every
day in every moment of your life.

00:43:04.779 --> 00:43:06.810
Lord Jesus, we thank you again for today.

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:09.600
We thank you so much for your word.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.150
We thank you so much, Lord,
that you remind even me.

00:43:13.425 --> 00:43:14.055
Lord this week.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.055
I don't know why you are doing
what you're doing in my life, but

00:43:17.055 --> 00:43:21.345
Lord, I know you're doing it for a
reason and so I'm not gonna worry.

00:43:22.995 --> 00:43:26.865
I'm done with worry and I'm
gonna continue to seek you first.

00:43:27.615 --> 00:43:34.036
And Lord, I pray that every
person in this room did just that.

00:43:34.725 --> 00:43:39.510
Lord, I'm praying that every person in
this room, Responded to you and said,

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:42.120
Lord, that they wanna put you first
in the area where they're worrying.

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:45.780
Lord, I pray that this transforms
them this week, and they begin

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:49.980
to experience shalom, Shalom,
which is your perfect peace.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.270
God, I pray that over every person
that may, they may experience that

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:55.891
a renewing relationship this week.

00:43:55.896 --> 00:43:58.470
Lord, change our lives.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.420
We pray this in Jesus name.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:01.410
Amen.

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:02.790
Let's stand and let's worship.
