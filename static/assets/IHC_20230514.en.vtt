00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.030
Well, good morning everybody.

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:12.509
I haven't got the opportunity to jump
up here and say Happy Mother's Day.

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:13.440
So Happy Mother's Day.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.050
To all the ladies in the room.

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.790
I always say at, at days like
today are a great time to remember.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.170
especially the mothers who created us.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.960
And so mom, if you're watching,
cuz typically my mom and dad watch.

00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:26.055
Happy Mother's Day.

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:28.675
and then also my lovely wife.

00:01:28.675 --> 00:01:29.575
Happy Mother's Day to you.

00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:32.425
Thank you so much for all
you do for our kiddos.

00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:37.175
So, today is special for mothers and
I think today's message, interestingly

00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:40.445
enough, even though we're continuing
our series, Shalom Shalom, which

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:41.675
is God's Perfect Peace, right?

00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:44.255
How do we find God's perfect peace
in the midst of our mental struggles?

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:47.675
I think worry is one of the
greatest topics to talk about

00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:49.085
when we're talking about mothers.

00:01:49.255 --> 00:01:50.875
I think mothers worry the most.

00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:54.265
Doesn't any of the mothers here agree that
you guys tend to worry a little bit more?

00:01:54.285 --> 00:01:54.635
Never.

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:55.435
Never.

00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:56.215
Okay, great.

00:01:56.395 --> 00:01:57.445
None of y'all gonna admit that.

00:01:58.075 --> 00:01:59.065
You can rip into that later.

00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:00.685
It's okay.

00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:06.284
but I, I think worry is something that
actually all of us deal with, and it's

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.474
one that most of us probably would not.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.240
Connect to like a mental struggle.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.090
We would just think, isn't
that just normal to worry?

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.780
And so we'll actually learn that
it's, it's normal to worry, yes.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.400
But it's also something that should not
cause us or, to be distracted or to cause

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.299
us to be consumed with these things.

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.869
And so the last couple of things that
we've talked about the last couple weeks,

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:33.889
technically, I guess we've been talking
about these mental struggles with anxiety.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.039
And depression.

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:37.499
And so today we're gonna jump into worry.

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.129
and I would say this, most of us probably
worry about things like our finances

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:48.039
or our health or our family or our
jobs or what's going on in the world.

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:51.069
Or you may even worry about what the
weather's gonna be tomorrow because

00:02:51.074 --> 00:02:52.149
it's gonna change all of your plans.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.049
and so we worry sometimes with
the smallest things all the way

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.699
to some of the biggest things.

00:02:58.424 --> 00:03:02.624
Here's a crazy statistic from the World
Health Organization, found that America,

00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:06.504
Americans have bigger problems, are
the biggest problem with worry than

00:03:06.504 --> 00:03:08.394
any other people in the world, right?

00:03:08.394 --> 00:03:12.324
Americans have the biggest problem
with worry than any other people

00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:15.924
in the world, and it's crazy to
think about a society like us in

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.384
America that has way more things.

00:03:19.314 --> 00:03:22.314
Yet is the one that struggles
with worry the most.

00:03:22.654 --> 00:03:24.874
and I would say this,
great, we won, right?

00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:25.684
America, we won.

00:03:25.684 --> 00:03:28.244
That's probably not something
we wanna win at, when it comes

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:29.474
to, to something to win at.

00:03:29.504 --> 00:03:33.134
But I would say this many of us
battle with what we would call chronic

00:03:33.224 --> 00:03:36.744
worry, something that continually
is on our mind and ever present,

00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:39.034
and it really takes our peace away.

00:03:39.034 --> 00:03:40.324
That's what we're talking
about here, right?

00:03:40.414 --> 00:03:40.894
Shalom.

00:03:40.894 --> 00:03:42.724
Shalom is God's perfect.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.319
Peace and worry is something that
still kills and destroys, our joy.

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.379
And really even, I would say this,
sometimes worry will even prevent

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.079
us from spiritually growing the
way that God has called us to grow.

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.929
And so just, raise their hands here.

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:58.549
Who here has worried before?

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.859
Yes, I've got everybody to raise their
hands for something because you would be

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:09.289
a straight up liar unless you're a newborn
baby that doesn't worry about anything.

00:04:09.994 --> 00:04:10.144
Okay.

00:04:10.144 --> 00:04:12.334
And I'm not calling newborn babies liars.

00:04:12.334 --> 00:04:13.054
I'm not gonna do that.

00:04:13.084 --> 00:04:13.324
Okay.

00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:14.824
But everybody else, okay.

00:04:15.044 --> 00:04:19.034
we've all worried at some point in
our life, and Barner research says

00:04:19.034 --> 00:04:24.074
that over 60% of adults in the US
struggle with worry and stress Daily.

00:04:24.124 --> 00:04:24.474
Daily.

00:04:25.404 --> 00:04:28.249
so what I would just say with this, here's
just a, a great way to look at this.

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.569
Take half the room.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.934
This isn't quite divided,
but half this room.

00:04:31.934 --> 00:04:32.774
Let's just shift this side.

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:34.394
60% of you are worried.

00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:34.844
It's you.

00:04:34.964 --> 00:04:35.774
You guys are great.

00:04:35.924 --> 00:04:36.824
You came in good.

00:04:37.124 --> 00:04:40.394
This side over here worries
and is stressed today.

00:04:41.234 --> 00:04:42.764
And no, that can be intermixed.

00:04:42.764 --> 00:04:45.944
But basically that's what we look
at in a room this size today.

00:04:46.064 --> 00:04:48.794
You came in with stress and
worry on your minds and hearts.

00:04:48.794 --> 00:04:49.454
Isn't that crazy?

00:04:50.234 --> 00:04:52.844
You came in that way and it
may not be crazy to you because

00:04:52.844 --> 00:04:53.714
you deal with it every day.

00:04:54.204 --> 00:04:58.229
but again, we talk about if you're dealing
with this today, Then let's talk about it.

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.079
How do we deal with, how
do we deal with our worry?

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:02.399
Why do I always worry?

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:04.829
And so we're gonna talk through this,
we're gonna use God's word to do

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:06.669
that, and, and talk more about it.

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.864
But I think when we think about why we wor
struggle and battle with worry, I, I think

00:05:11.864 --> 00:05:13.514
that it's number one, it's gonna be crazy.

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:15.314
You're gonna hear me
say this, but it's true.

00:05:16.064 --> 00:05:19.004
We battle with worry
because we're sinners.

00:05:20.504 --> 00:05:23.774
That, that may not sound really good to
you, but we're sinners, and lemme just

00:05:23.774 --> 00:05:28.664
explain this as sinners, which means this,
we're experiencing god's not god's best.

00:05:28.664 --> 00:05:31.784
I always communicate this, that sin is
not experiencing God's best for our life.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:36.454
and that means that when we are
worrying, we're taking all of our life

00:05:36.484 --> 00:05:38.254
and all of our worries in our control.

00:05:38.464 --> 00:05:40.804
So worry is when we're trying
to figure out how to fix it.

00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:46.009
Trust and faith is when we trust
and put it all in God's hands.

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.039
And so that's actually a sin
when we end up, trying to control

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.449
things and do things on our own.

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.469
And again, it's taking life into our own
hands and that should not consume us.

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.019
And we say again, that worry
is just part of our lives, but

00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:58.799
it shouldn't be, but it is.

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.429
and a couple weeks ago when we
talked about anxiety, you may be

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:02.929
saying the same statement as well.

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.499
Isn't worry and anxiety the same thing?

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:08.149
No.

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.894
And here here's really
just the difference of it.

00:06:11.134 --> 00:06:13.984
Worry tends to be
experienced in our minds.

00:06:13.984 --> 00:06:18.394
It's something where we think on
it over and over and over again.

00:06:18.824 --> 00:06:21.254
but anxiety we tend to
experience in our bodies.

00:06:21.254 --> 00:06:23.294
It ends up actually
going and consuming us.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:24.974
And so I just wanna give
you a quick example here.

00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:26.959
you may be worried that
you're gonna miss a flight.

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:29.884
In the morning, if you're gonna go fly
somewhere, you're, you may be worried

00:06:29.884 --> 00:06:31.744
you're gonna miss the flight, so you
wanna make sure you set your alarm

00:06:31.744 --> 00:06:35.314
clock, but you may be anxious over
flying, which means it becomes something

00:06:35.314 --> 00:06:38.674
that you can't hardly get on the plane
because you're so nervous and you're,

00:06:38.854 --> 00:06:40.444
and it just begins to consume you.

00:06:40.874 --> 00:06:44.194
and so again, worries a little bit more
specific and, and that, and so Matthew

00:06:44.534 --> 00:06:47.174
six today, if you wanna know where
we're going today, Matthew, chapter six,

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:50.024
we're gonna be in verses 24 through 34.

00:06:50.844 --> 00:06:55.044
this is where Jesus, and I
love this, Jesus addresses

00:06:55.194 --> 00:06:57.384
worry and he says, don't worry.

00:06:57.844 --> 00:07:00.004
and, and I love this because,
you know, there's sometimes I'm

00:07:00.004 --> 00:07:02.854
reading in God's word and I'm
like, you know, is, is this true?

00:07:02.854 --> 00:07:05.704
But whenever Jesus says something, it's
just like I lean in a little bit more.

00:07:06.484 --> 00:07:08.314
And today, I hope you
lean a little bit more.

00:07:08.314 --> 00:07:09.764
So, let's jump into this.

00:07:09.764 --> 00:07:10.784
Matthew chapter six.

00:07:10.784 --> 00:07:13.274
We're gonna again read
TW verses 24 through 34.

00:07:13.274 --> 00:07:14.024
Here's what it says.

00:07:14.354 --> 00:07:18.434
It says, no one can serve two
masters since either he will hate

00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:23.204
one and love the other, or he will be
devoted to one and despise the other.

00:07:23.684 --> 00:07:25.504
You cannot serve both God and money.

00:07:26.384 --> 00:07:31.814
And then he says, therefore I tell
you, don't worry about your life, what

00:07:31.814 --> 00:07:33.764
you will eat, what you will drink.

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:36.359
Or about your body and what you will wear.

00:07:36.359 --> 00:07:38.519
Isn't life more than food?

00:07:38.609 --> 00:07:40.619
And isn't the body more than clothing?

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:43.619
Consider the birds of the
air and birds of the sky.

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:47.309
They don't sow or reap or
gather into Barnes, yet your

00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:48.599
heavenly father feeds them.

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:52.350
Aren't you worth more
than they can any of you?

00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:55.349
Add one moment to his
lifespan by worrying.

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:57.539
I want you to lean into that verse.

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:02.099
Can any of you add one moment
to his lifespan by worrying?

00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:05.279
Why do you worry about clothes?

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:08.819
Observe how the wildflowers and
the field grows, don't they?

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:12.749
Labor and spin thread yet I tell
you, not even Solomon in all of his

00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:14.549
splendor was adorned like one of these.

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:18.419
And if that's how God closed the grass
of the field, which is here today

00:08:18.424 --> 00:08:21.939
and thrown into the furnace tomorrow,
won't he much do much more for you?

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:27.029
You of little faith, so don't worry
saying, what will we eat or what

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:30.839
will we drink, or what will we
wear For the Gentiles eagerly seek

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:34.739
all these things and your Heavenly
Father knows that you need them.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:39.599
But seek first the kingdom of God and
his righteousness, and all of these

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:40.919
things will be provided for you.

00:08:40.924 --> 00:08:46.019
Therefore, don't worry about tomorrow
because tomorrow will worry about itself.

00:08:46.289 --> 00:08:48.659
Each day has enough trouble of its own.

00:08:49.319 --> 00:08:49.949
So let's pray.

00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:52.319
Lord Jesus, we thank you
so much again for today.

00:08:52.319 --> 00:08:53.669
We thank you for bringing us here.

00:08:54.374 --> 00:08:56.514
On this special, mother's Day occasion.

00:08:56.519 --> 00:09:00.774
And Lord, as we begin to discuss
this topic of worry, I'm so thankful

00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:04.854
that your word brings to light
how we can address this and how

00:09:04.854 --> 00:09:07.044
we can continue to overcome worry.

00:09:07.494 --> 00:09:10.794
Because as we even know, Lord, there's
so many in this room that has walked

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:12.634
into this room with worry and stress.

00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:15.874
Lord, I pray that you begin
to just renew their mind.

00:09:15.874 --> 00:09:18.464
You begin to, help them see a hope in you.

00:09:18.464 --> 00:09:22.094
And as they seek first you Lord,
that they will overcome that

00:09:22.154 --> 00:09:23.564
worry, Lord, in their lives.

00:09:23.894 --> 00:09:25.574
And so, Lord, we just pray
this in your heaven name.

00:09:26.354 --> 00:09:26.684
Amen.

00:09:27.704 --> 00:09:28.514
So what?

00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:30.169
Not to worry about.

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:30.379
Right.

00:09:30.379 --> 00:09:32.869
This is the first thing we're gonna
talk about is what not to worry about.

00:09:33.089 --> 00:09:36.019
I actually grew up, with my grandma,
would take, usually my grandma and

00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:39.109
grandpa would take us on the weekends
and, usually the next, Monday morning,

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.009
they would take us back to our parents and
my grandma would take us in her van and

00:09:43.014 --> 00:09:46.249
originally was in her Jeep, that she had
been in her van and she would put on this

00:09:46.254 --> 00:09:49.925
song, Called, don't worry, don't worry.

00:09:50.675 --> 00:09:51.874
A bee happy now.

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:54.694
Ooh, okay, so you don't wanna
hear me sing anymore, right?

00:09:54.964 --> 00:09:57.035
So we used to listen to this and
when she used to like pump the brakes

00:09:57.035 --> 00:09:58.535
to this thing, like, we loved it.

00:09:58.685 --> 00:09:59.555
We loved it.

00:09:59.734 --> 00:10:03.035
And so as I'm preparing this
sermon, my mind goes back to those

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.954
moments we're in those moments.

00:10:04.954 --> 00:10:06.574
We were having so much fun in the van.

00:10:06.694 --> 00:10:07.324
We didn't worry.

00:10:08.045 --> 00:10:08.974
We didn't worry about anything.

00:10:09.665 --> 00:10:12.244
And, and I look at this text
and I go, this is, I feel like

00:10:12.305 --> 00:10:13.594
the Lord's singing to us today.

00:10:14.224 --> 00:10:14.704
Don't worry.

00:10:15.455 --> 00:10:18.215
Be happy now, again, that may sound
annoying to you because you don't

00:10:18.215 --> 00:10:19.845
wanna worry and you wanna be happy.

00:10:20.569 --> 00:10:23.540
I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm telling you
the, the times that I've said that to

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.130
myself, I don't wanna worry about this.

00:10:25.219 --> 00:10:25.910
I wanna be happy.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.910
I wanna, you know, and, and Nate, I
think the Lord's gonna speak to us about

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.869
what not to worry about, but then he's
gonna give us a help and a hope on what

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.239
to overcome in the midst of our worry.

00:10:35.244 --> 00:10:38.216
And so the first thing he says, and
that's why I read verse 24, because

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:42.475
that verse 25 says, therefore, he says,
don't worry about money, basically.

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:42.805
Right?

00:10:42.925 --> 00:10:44.095
Or finances.

00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:46.314
And then he goes on and he
talks about, don't worry about.

00:10:46.569 --> 00:10:47.979
Basically your food or drink.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.420
and then he goes on and he says,
don't worry about your clothing.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.959
And then later on in verse 34, he
says, don't worry about your future.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.319
So as pastors, we do a great
job of kind of helping all

00:10:57.319 --> 00:10:58.160
of us remember these things.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.360
So here's what basically Jesus said, don't
worry about your finances, your food, your

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.310
fitness, your fashion, or your future.

00:11:04.329 --> 00:11:07.339
Don't worry about your finances,
your food, your fitness,

00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:08.839
your fashion, or your future.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.630
I'm pretty sure that covers pretty
much everything we deal with.

00:11:12.165 --> 00:11:13.640
Pretty much everything we deal with.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.230
And so what verse 25 says
is, it says, don't worry.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:19.880
So everybody say that with me.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.550
Everybody say, don't worry, don't worry.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.730
See, we need to remember these
things in God's word as we go about

00:11:25.735 --> 00:11:26.990
our lives, says, okay, don't worry.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.510
But what do we not worry about?

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.189
And then I'm just gonna kinda
walk through this pretty quickly

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.900
and kind of break this down.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.210
So again, he says, don't
worry about finances.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.189
Typically, we worry about finances
because we have a lack of finances.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.110
I've learned in life.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.530
You know, I've kind of lived a little
bit of, of life at this point in the,

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.850
the corporate world and, and in ministry
and in just taking care of my family.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:54.920
And I've learned the more money I make,
it seems like the more money I need.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.130
It seems like I can never get enough.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.120
Anybody ever feel that way?

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.570
And so I, I've, I've learned
after all these years, it's

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.780
taken years that Jesus is right.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.400
Hey, he's always right, but he's right.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.500
I'm, I'm, it's like I, I can't keep
worrying about finances, and I think

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.460
we typically lack finances, and
that's why we are worried about them.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.720
But some of us may make a lot of
money and we worry about how we

00:12:20.725 --> 00:12:24.290
should spend it or where we should
invest or what we should do with it.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.970
And then when we buy things, I mean,
I'm telling you, I know some people

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.070
that make like 10 times as much as
me, and they have all these boats in

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:35.570
these houses, and they're so stressed
out because they feel so consumed

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:36.650
by the things in which they have.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.760
So that may be you.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.410
And if it's you, hey, I
wanna ride on your boat.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.130
Call me.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.210
I'll take care of that
for you for the weekend.

00:12:43.115 --> 00:12:44.135
just joking.

00:12:44.795 --> 00:12:48.185
So these are obviously something that
we would worry about his finances,

00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:52.415
and so Jesus knows this, and so
it's a constant battle when we think

00:12:52.415 --> 00:12:54.485
about worrying about money, but
Jesus says, don't worry about it.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:54.814
Right?

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:57.125
And then we see in verse 25,
he says, don't worry about your

00:12:57.125 --> 00:12:59.165
life, but then he gets really
specific with your life, right?

00:12:59.194 --> 00:13:00.855
He says, don't worry
about eating or drinking.

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:03.574
Really, if you want to think about
it, don't worry about your body.

00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:05.885
I use that word fitness and
some of you may be like, what?

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:07.295
I don't ever worry about my fitness.

00:13:07.475 --> 00:13:08.855
let's just think a little bit about this.

00:13:08.855 --> 00:13:09.005
Okay.

00:13:09.005 --> 00:13:13.265
So for some, Jesus is speaking
to some who may be poor that are

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.435
worried about their next meal.

00:13:14.435 --> 00:13:18.275
So it makes sense, but what Jesus is
telling them, if I take care of the birds

00:13:18.485 --> 00:13:19.905
and I take care of the flowers, like.

00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:22.125
I'm gonna take care of you.

00:13:22.155 --> 00:13:23.535
You're my greatest creation.

00:13:23.535 --> 00:13:26.355
So he's telling them, those who
would worry about getting food or

00:13:26.355 --> 00:13:28.665
drink daily to not worry about it.

00:13:29.265 --> 00:13:32.115
But you know, and I think the funniest
thing is, is those of us that the

00:13:32.115 --> 00:13:34.965
biggest worries we have, especially
somebody, you're gonna deal with this

00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:36.465
today, you're gonna get in the car.

00:13:36.465 --> 00:13:39.325
And what's the question that
somebody's gonna ask you?

00:13:39.935 --> 00:13:41.595
Where do you want to eat?

00:13:42.165 --> 00:13:43.305
Where do you want to eat?

00:13:43.395 --> 00:13:45.015
And you know what they're gonna say, UR.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.220
And I'm gonna say, well,
I don't care either.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.340
Well then the next thing you know, 15
minutes later we're stressed out, worried,

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.260
and in a fight and we're not talking.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.150
And when this happens,
text me say it happened.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:57.630
Okay?

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:03.420
So most of us worry about food
and drink in a different way, and

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.231
it becomes this, don't wanna make
decisions and it stresses you out.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.920
And then it's just like, Oh man, it's
crazy that that's what we deal with,

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.300
but that's exactly what we deal with.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.860
And so he is saying,
don't worry about this.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:14.160
Right.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.280
But I would even dive a little bit
deeper cuz sometimes we get consumed.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.180
Some people in my world, again, i I
I coach, CrossFit, during the week,

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.090
some of the people I get around is
they get so consumed with eating

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.270
the right things, their fitness.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.550
That they get so consumed by it, but
it seems like all day long they're like

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.310
thinking of these things and tracking
these things, and how many macros

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.630
am I eating and how much do I weigh?

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.810
And all of a sudden it consumes them that
they don't have enough or they're not

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.850
skinny enough or they're, you name it.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.350
And we become consumed with that.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.910
And it's not saying not to be healthy.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.040
That's not what Jesus is not
saying, but he's saying, Hey,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:44.920
don't worry about those things.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.300
and I've learned over time,
anybody ever done this before?

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.050
You go eat an expensive meal and
three hours later you're hungry.

00:14:53.045 --> 00:14:55.980
And I'm just like, it doesn't matter
what I eat, it really doesn't matter.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.790
and so he says, don't worry about that.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.070
Then he goes on in, in verse 25,
he says, don't worry about what

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.530
you will wear, what you will wear.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.740
anybody really focus on what you
wear specifically on Sunday mornings.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.660
I mean, like, do you ever
spend some extra time?

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.880
Ladies, you, you ever fix
your hair a little bit longer?

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.170
No, not, not James.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:15.130
He's good.

00:15:16.945 --> 00:15:18.805
I'm telling you though, it happens.

00:15:18.805 --> 00:15:20.305
Where this it, it's okay.

00:15:20.485 --> 00:15:21.325
Let me just tell you.

00:15:21.535 --> 00:15:22.195
I love this.

00:15:22.765 --> 00:15:24.655
I like wearing gray with gray.

00:15:25.435 --> 00:15:26.155
Britney's not in here.

00:15:26.215 --> 00:15:26.905
I don't know where she went.

00:15:26.995 --> 00:15:28.045
I like wearing gray with gray.

00:15:28.045 --> 00:15:31.045
You know what she tells me every
time I put it on that does not match.

00:15:31.135 --> 00:15:32.545
I say it matches perfectly.

00:15:33.055 --> 00:15:34.075
She doesn't agree.

00:15:34.195 --> 00:15:35.775
So then I have to stress
about what I wear.

00:15:36.325 --> 00:15:37.975
I'm joking, but that's true though.

00:15:38.185 --> 00:15:41.395
I used to actually wear an orange
shirt with red pants and then

00:15:41.395 --> 00:15:43.525
that really was just not okay.

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:47.275
But sometimes we get so consumed
with what we wear that it causes

00:15:47.275 --> 00:15:50.215
us to worry and stress because
we don't have the right clothes.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.275
And then all of a sudden, if we took
all the time, we focused on what we

00:15:53.275 --> 00:15:56.635
wore and spent that time with Jesus,
our lives would be transformed.

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:58.105
I'm just taking a side note here.

00:15:58.405 --> 00:16:02.455
If we took all the time, we worried
about what we wore and exactly how we

00:16:02.455 --> 00:16:04.435
looked and folks said, all on Jesus.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.390
We could really be
transformed in our lives.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.780
So he is saying, again, don't
worry about our clothes.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.620
And then the last, in verse 34, he
says, don't worry about tomorrow.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.520
For tomorrow.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.930
Worries about itself.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.710
Anybody ever stress and
worry about the future?

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:21.370
Anybody?

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.930
I think so many of us do, right?

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.740
The future of what job am I gonna have?

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:27.700
Am I gonna have a job?

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.130
What are my kids gonna, you
know, are they gonna grow up

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.030
and they're gonna love Jesus?

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.920
Are they gonna make the right decisions?

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.420
You know, all these different
future things that consume us,

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.840
we begin to worry about right
where we're gonna go to school.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.860
and Jesus addresses that.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:48.230
He says, do not worry about these things
because he says today has its own worries.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.530
Right?

00:16:48.535 --> 00:16:51.110
And he is the one that controls tomorrow.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.090
So to hear Jesus say, don't worry about
these things may kind of frustrate

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.760
you because you worry about them.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.030
I, I'm telling you these, these are
the things about the Bible that I.

00:17:02.585 --> 00:17:06.125
Get frustrated with, but then I
have to kind of reconcile with

00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:07.265
the things I get frustrated with.

00:17:07.265 --> 00:17:09.665
The Bible is when they contradict my life.

00:17:10.775 --> 00:17:12.035
Anybody, anybody.

00:17:12.035 --> 00:17:14.795
Maybe I'm the only one, but
I'm reading and I'm studying

00:17:14.855 --> 00:17:15.875
and God says, don't worry.

00:17:16.715 --> 00:17:17.465
And I'm like, but I do.

00:17:18.365 --> 00:17:19.025
What do I do?

00:17:19.235 --> 00:17:21.306
And a lot of times we
don't know what to do.

00:17:21.545 --> 00:17:23.135
And that's what I love about the Bible.

00:17:23.255 --> 00:17:25.175
Usually it doesn't just say, don't worry.

00:17:25.925 --> 00:17:28.835
God's giving you guidance
on how to overcome worry.

00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:31.850
And so, so, you know,
I'm the, the same way.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.790
So if you're saying, Hey, I walked in
here with worry and stress, I get it.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.400
Here's what I've learned recently.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:41.420
What I preach on, I tend to struggle
with within the weeks coming up to it.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.650
I told Brittany this last
week, next sermon series, I'm,

00:17:45.655 --> 00:17:46.790
I'm preaching on blessing.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.070
I just wanna be blessed, like that's it.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.440
Because it seems like over the
last couple weeks I've dealt with

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.210
anxiety, depression, and worry.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.440
I'm like, why?

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.090
And here's what I've learned.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.880
God's using it for the
benefit of those around me.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.460
And he's, he's asking me this
question like you asked me this week.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.260
He says, do you trust me here?

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.270
So let me just kind of
fill you in real quick.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.200
So last week if you were
here, I dealt with Arick neck.

00:18:09.335 --> 00:18:13.685
I dealt with my car breaking down
on Saturday and my hou my roof

00:18:13.685 --> 00:18:15.095
had a leak on Sunday morning.

00:18:15.765 --> 00:18:16.755
bad weekend.

00:18:16.815 --> 00:18:17.625
It's totally fine.

00:18:17.655 --> 00:18:18.795
Everybody has a bad weekend.

00:18:19.125 --> 00:18:21.735
I get my car, so I bring my car
and they fix something on Monday,

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.715
Tuesday, I get it out of the shop.

00:18:23.715 --> 00:18:25.755
The next day, Britney's
Transmission goes out.

00:18:26.835 --> 00:18:29.535
I mean, literally the next day,
Britt's transmission goes out.

00:18:29.535 --> 00:18:29.925
Gone.

00:18:31.155 --> 00:18:31.815
Well, great.

00:18:31.935 --> 00:18:34.875
We can't, we got a car that doesn't even
fit all of our family legally in it.

00:18:35.385 --> 00:18:35.985
Left.

00:18:36.535 --> 00:18:41.845
so anyways, I'm like starting to
worry and I'm literally preaching

00:18:41.845 --> 00:18:43.885
on wor that, I mean, seriously,
the first thing comes to my mind.

00:18:43.885 --> 00:18:44.485
Great.

00:18:45.355 --> 00:18:47.275
I've actually gotta
apply what I'm preaching.

00:18:47.545 --> 00:18:48.345
Like it's those moments.

00:18:48.655 --> 00:18:53.545
And then I ask this question in my mind,
why, why are we going through this?

00:18:54.595 --> 00:18:56.635
And I just realized God's saying this.

00:18:57.055 --> 00:18:58.195
Do you trust me here?

00:18:59.815 --> 00:19:01.195
Do you trust me here?

00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:05.035
Because I'm gonna, I'm just gonna, I
mean, it's, it's easy at times, like

00:19:05.215 --> 00:19:06.415
I've given my life to you, Jesus.

00:19:06.415 --> 00:19:11.995
I trust you with my salvation, but not
my job, not my family, not my future, not

00:19:11.995 --> 00:19:15.745
my health, not my life, but my salvation.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.165
I got you.

00:19:16.495 --> 00:19:17.156
I don't worry about that.

00:19:17.785 --> 00:19:19.525
But I'm gonna kick everything
else under control.

00:19:19.975 --> 00:19:23.815
And so that's where I felt like right
now, the Lord is, is challenging me.

00:19:23.815 --> 00:19:26.245
So if you're wondering, Hey,
do you struggle with worry?

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:26.995
Yes.

00:19:27.055 --> 00:19:31.555
And God is teaching me to trust him
even in the midst of some crazy things.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.725
So how do we respond?

00:19:32.725 --> 00:19:33.055
Right?

00:19:33.295 --> 00:19:34.405
There's too much to worry about.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.395
How do we respond?

00:19:35.795 --> 00:19:38.645
and I would say, this is, if I don't worry
about it, who's gonna worry about it?

00:19:39.385 --> 00:19:43.010
And I realize that Jesus is the one
that doesn't even worry because he's

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:44.420
already knows what's gonna happen.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.820
So let's gonna go on
to the next thing here.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.160
So now we say, what do we worry about?

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:53.510
We already talked about that, how to not
worry, and it starts with remembering.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.280
Let's look at verse 26.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.710
So verse 26 says this,
I gotta get back here.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.180
Consider the birds of the sky.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.910
They don't sow or reap or
gather into Barnes yet your

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.350
heavenly father feeds them.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.270
Aren't you worth more than these?

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.540
And then he says, can any of you add
one moment to his life about worrying?

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.700
And then he goes on about,
clothing and, and all these

00:20:12.705 --> 00:20:13.571
flowers and all these things.

00:20:13.576 --> 00:20:16.270
And so he says, consider this.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.730
And, and I'll just tell you
this, like, I like birds.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.800
But I feel like I'm pretty important
compared to birds and Jesus is backing

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.350
that up and, and it really just helps me.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.320
So we have to remember sometimes
if God is taking care of them,

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.810
won't he take care of me?

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.310
Won't he take care of my family?

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.870
Won't he take care of my health?

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.190
Won't he take care of the
relational issues that I'm

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:38.350
having with family or friends?

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:39.390
You name it.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.670
Whatever it is, you are
more worthy than that.

00:20:43.225 --> 00:20:47.005
And so we can learn to not worry
because we know that Jesus will

00:20:47.065 --> 00:20:50.935
always be and has always been a
provider in our times of needs.

00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:54.565
And, and I would look at this, sometimes
this timing may not be perfect for

00:20:54.565 --> 00:20:58.285
you and it's because sometimes we
don't see the perspective, and I'm

00:20:58.285 --> 00:20:59.935
remembering this over and over again.

00:21:00.505 --> 00:21:05.755
My perspective in life is
limited, my perspective in life.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.695
So just so you know right now,
I can see you guys' perspective.

00:21:08.725 --> 00:21:09.865
This is what I can see.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.835
But God sees everything.

00:21:12.895 --> 00:21:16.585
There are so many working parts in
this world, and he's working every

00:21:16.585 --> 00:21:20.065
one of them in such a way so that
not only he gets glory, but other

00:21:20.065 --> 00:21:23.005
people experience him in a unique way.

00:21:23.605 --> 00:21:26.335
And so sometimes the trials in what
you're going through, the things in which

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.635
you're worrying about is for something.

00:21:28.975 --> 00:21:31.735
It is preparing you or the
other person for something.

00:21:31.855 --> 00:21:36.655
It's allowing you, just like for us, in
that midst of the transmission, going

00:21:36.655 --> 00:21:39.145
out of God saying, do you trust me here?

00:21:39.505 --> 00:21:43.465
It's God asking that question because
it's constantly that loyalty idea.

00:21:43.855 --> 00:21:44.905
Do you trust me here?

00:21:45.265 --> 00:21:46.285
Do you trust me there?

00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:49.615
And it's over and over again where we
go back to his word and we remember

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.645
if he provided for the birds, if he
provided for this, if he takes care

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:54.865
of that, then he'll take care of me.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.430
And it's interesting when
you think about birds.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.070
See, birds don't just sit
there and God provides for 'em.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.300
Birds actually have concern, Hey, I'm
hungry, and they go do something about it.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.020
Knowing that God will provide the food
for them or provide the nest for them.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.340
So I really wanna talk about two words.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.950
Number one, the difference
between concern and worry.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.720
Concern is focusing on challenges
and it moves you to action.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.720
So I would say this, if your
marriage is struggling, you

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.620
go to a marriage counseling.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.780
You don't sit there and
worry about your marriage.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.490
You go and you do something about it.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.970
Knowing that God wants to restore
that marriage, if we think about,

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:31.900
Hey, I've gained 12 pounds, you don't
sit there and worry that you're gonna

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.830
continue to gain weight, you're going
to recognize that and know that God can

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.370
help you make the right decisions to
eliminate some food and to choose the

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:40.750
right things to help you be healthy.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.420
So concern actually moves you to action.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.900
In faith, knowing that God has
provided a way to handle that

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:52.180
worry, but worry focuses on what's
beyond your control and the results.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.950
It results in inaction.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:54.820
So I'm gonna say this again.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:23:00.701
Worry focuses on what you cannot control,
and it causes you to inaction, right?

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.580
You begin to be consumed on it.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.510
So let me just give you this statement.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.180
It's stewing, overdoing, right?

00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:09.370
It's stewing over what you're
worrying about rather than

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.140
actually doing something with it.

00:23:11.145 --> 00:23:12.280
And that can be crippling.

00:23:12.805 --> 00:23:17.605
Worry can become crippling in our lives
where we become so consumed by him.

00:23:18.235 --> 00:23:23.035
And so he says this, can any one of you
add a moment to your life by worrying?

00:23:23.575 --> 00:23:26.485
So in other words, has
anyone ever gotten better?

00:23:26.995 --> 00:23:28.885
Like anything ever gotten
better about worrying?

00:23:28.885 --> 00:23:30.986
Like if you worried on it,
did, did life get better?

00:23:31.355 --> 00:23:31.845
Anybody?

00:23:33.475 --> 00:23:34.045
No.

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:39.715
100% of the time when you worry, it
actually distracts you from being able to

00:23:39.715 --> 00:23:41.215
overcome whatever you're worried about.

00:23:41.725 --> 00:23:43.405
Let me, let me just share this with you.

00:23:43.435 --> 00:23:51.715
100% of the time when you worry, you
will not have peace 1% of the time.

00:23:52.795 --> 00:23:56.605
I, I like the odds of this idea of
sitting here thinking if I worry something

00:23:56.605 --> 00:24:02.275
may come true, but if I don't worry
1% of the time, I don't have to worry.

00:24:02.275 --> 00:24:03.495
Like it, it's God's gotta taken care of.

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:05.575
It's, it's not going to hold me back.

00:24:05.845 --> 00:24:07.885
And I think that is so
important to remember.

00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:09.775
That God is in control.

00:24:09.835 --> 00:24:12.775
He is the one that says that he
provides for the birds of the air.

00:24:12.805 --> 00:24:15.145
He'll provide for each one of us.

00:24:15.445 --> 00:24:18.775
And so you may not have a password
God has provided for you, but here,

00:24:18.895 --> 00:24:20.395
let me just remind you of this.

00:24:20.515 --> 00:24:25.735
A lot of times when something tragic
happens, and I keep using our cars as

00:24:25.735 --> 00:24:29.395
an example, but it could be loss of a
love one, it could be something else.

00:24:29.905 --> 00:24:36.760
But when something happens where you begin
to worry, We end up getting so consumed

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.860
with, well, where's God at in this?

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.420
Where's God at in this?

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:44.740
And we forget all the time before when you
didn't have anything to worry about how

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:50.230
God had provided every day he was there
every day, he provided life every day.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.980
He provided for every instance
that you used to worry

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.250
about, he provided every day.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:58.870
But the moment that we begin to lose a
transmission or begin to have struggles

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.765
with other family members, the moment
that we do that, And we see that.

00:25:01.765 --> 00:25:02.875
We wonder, where's God at?

00:25:02.935 --> 00:25:03.385
Where's God at?

00:25:03.445 --> 00:25:04.525
He's always been there.

00:25:04.555 --> 00:25:08.545
He's with you in the midst of
worry and he says, don't worry,

00:25:09.115 --> 00:25:10.045
I've got it taken care of.

00:25:10.045 --> 00:25:10.765
Don't worry.

00:25:10.765 --> 00:25:14.425
Trust me in this relationship that you're
having to struggle with, whatever you're

00:25:14.425 --> 00:25:16.915
struggling with, God says, don't worry.

00:25:17.815 --> 00:25:20.515
And so if God's gonna take care
of the birds of the ear again, how

00:25:20.515 --> 00:25:21.925
much more will he take care of you?

00:25:22.405 --> 00:25:26.065
And so when we are saying that, we
worry, this is a hard statement, but we

00:25:26.065 --> 00:25:27.775
need to hear this when we say we worry.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.600
When we do worry, we're actually
saying, God, I don't trust you.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.190
God, I don't trust you.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.510
I don't trust your plan.

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.950
I don't believe you're for me.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:36.970
I don't believe you're good.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:42.285
And that, that's hard for me to say,
because I want to be like, no, but I do.

00:25:42.645 --> 00:25:44.565
But when I worry, I'm
actually saying I don't.

00:25:44.625 --> 00:25:47.535
And so this is a statement I've
shared before, but what we worry

00:25:47.535 --> 00:25:51.375
about most reveals where you trust God
the least, I'm gonna say this again.

00:25:51.645 --> 00:25:56.325
What you worry about most is
where you trust God the least.

00:25:57.155 --> 00:26:00.870
And so again, if you think,
you know, I'm judging you, I, I

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:01.950
struggle with that same thing.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.640
And that's why I tell you there's
those moments in life when things

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:10.290
come reigning in and you're
like, oh man, what am I gonna do?

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:11.190
And how are we gonna handle this?

00:26:11.195 --> 00:26:12.870
And what are we gonna, how
are we gonna overcome this?

00:26:12.875 --> 00:26:14.550
All this worry comes in on my life.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.340
I have to go back to
and remember God's word.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:22.500
I have to go back because it's easy
to hang out and worry the what ifs.

00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:26.145
But God says that he'll take care of us.

00:26:26.145 --> 00:26:29.055
And what I think is so important with this
is just like with the birds of ver, cuz I

00:26:29.055 --> 00:26:30.675
think we have to keep thinking about this.

00:26:30.735 --> 00:26:35.655
They don't worry about food because
they know God has prepared it for 'em.

00:26:35.925 --> 00:26:39.645
Even if they have to search a
little longer, even if they have

00:26:39.645 --> 00:26:41.535
to search a little longer, they
know it's going to be there.

00:26:42.195 --> 00:26:46.005
So for us, at times, in the midst
of our worry, we have to have in

00:26:46.005 --> 00:26:49.485
faith, know that God is going to
provide a way out, a way to overcome.

00:26:51.435 --> 00:26:53.745
It may take a little bit
longer, and that's in his timing

00:26:53.745 --> 00:26:55.485
because he knows what you need.

00:26:56.325 --> 00:26:58.485
So right where you're sitting, I
want you to just begin to think

00:26:58.485 --> 00:27:00.645
about what you've worried about.

00:27:00.645 --> 00:27:02.685
And the reason why I want you,
I'm preparing your hearts.

00:27:02.895 --> 00:27:05.025
I want you to begin to think about
what you've been worrying about lately.

00:27:05.505 --> 00:27:08.715
Maybe it's a relationship
that has gone astray.

00:27:08.715 --> 00:27:11.835
Maybe it's a, a child
that you're worried about.

00:27:12.205 --> 00:27:13.495
maybe it's your marriage.

00:27:13.865 --> 00:27:16.475
maybe it's your health or your job.

00:27:17.425 --> 00:27:18.800
Maybe you, you fill in the blank.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.420
Be begin to be thinking about that.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.270
Because what will happen in
days like today is you'll say,

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.890
Hey, this is a great message.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.960
and then you're gonna walk out and
then tomorrow morning you're gonna

00:27:27.965 --> 00:27:29.400
worry and you're gonna forget that.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.490
So as you begin to think about worry
today, you're gonna get an opportunity

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.900
to cast that over to the Lord.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:38.460
And so once we've identified what we've
worried about, what are we supposed to do?

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.360
That's always the question.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.870
Okay.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:43.320
I, I'm worried, what do I do with it?

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:44.820
What do I do?

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.680
And this is where we look at verse 33.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.210
Verse 33.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.040
Well actually, actually
it's 31 through 33.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.030
Let's look at this together.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.100
He says, don't worry.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:53.790
So don't worry.

00:27:53.795 --> 00:27:57.300
What, what you will eat or
what you will drink, or what

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.430
we'll wear for the Gentiles.

00:27:59.435 --> 00:28:01.740
And really what he's saying,
Gentiles says, unbelievers.

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:07.350
So people who don't know Jesus, Worry
about these things, but if you came

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.170
into this room and know Jesus, or if
you haven't given your life to Jesus and

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.800
you want to, if you have a relationship
with Jesus, he says, then you don't

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.730
need to worry about these things.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.420
He says, the Gentiles eagerly seek these
things and your heavenly Father knows

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:23.250
you need them, but seek first the kingdom
of God and his righteousness, and all of

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.630
these things will be provided for you.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.800
I underlined the word all because
there, you know, it's those moments

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.210
where I'm like, well, sometimes, right?

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.770
No, he says All.

00:28:32.625 --> 00:28:33.675
Will be provided for you.

00:28:33.885 --> 00:28:37.845
Does this mean that we're gonna be poured
out blessing where we now have $10,000

00:28:37.845 --> 00:28:39.165
in our bank account whenever we go home?

00:28:39.735 --> 00:28:40.905
Probably not.

00:28:41.175 --> 00:28:42.225
That's not what he's saying.

00:28:42.225 --> 00:28:45.915
That if I just seek firstly Kingdom,
my Godd, my, you know, credit score's

00:28:45.915 --> 00:28:49.025
gonna go up and my family's gonna come
over and say, Hey, I am totally wrong.

00:28:49.335 --> 00:28:53.535
I, you know, that, that may
happen, it could, that's not

00:28:53.535 --> 00:28:54.585
exactly what he's saying.

00:28:54.645 --> 00:28:57.255
And my neck thing is
just totally twisted now.

00:28:58.235 --> 00:28:59.105
sorry, side note.

00:28:59.675 --> 00:29:04.235
So whenever you're worried, whenever
you're consumed with, with whatever

00:29:04.265 --> 00:29:07.565
you're stressed about, he says
to seek first the kingdom of God.

00:29:07.775 --> 00:29:12.785
So when I ask this question
is, are you seeking first God?

00:29:13.805 --> 00:29:15.425
I mean, I, I think that's the simple part.

00:29:15.425 --> 00:29:17.135
Today, if we wanna talk
about this, I worry.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.045
And I don't know how to overcome worry.

00:29:18.725 --> 00:29:19.745
What do I do?

00:29:20.765 --> 00:29:21.725
Seek first God?

00:29:22.865 --> 00:29:24.185
Now the question is, are you?

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.790
For those of you that walked in this
room, you may say, I walked in and I've

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.950
been a believer of Jesus for 27 years.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.080
50 years, one month.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.980
Yeah.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.840
I put God first in my life.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.160
But do you, do I?

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.580
I mean, in writing this message,
I had to truly ask that question.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.341
Seek first the kingdom of God.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.360
You know what?

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.830
Wanna know what a lot
of my days look like?

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:52.160
I'm like rolling outta bed, running late.

00:29:52.975 --> 00:29:55.940
And I'm rushing to get in the
shower and put on the right

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.040
clothes because they didn't match.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:02.870
And I'm hungry, so I gotta get food or
I've gotta stop by somewhere and get food,

00:30:02.875 --> 00:30:04.520
which is gonna make me late for work.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:08.450
And all of a sudden my day's
gone on and I'm seeking first

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.720
food, water, what I'm wearing.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:16.670
Does that sound familiar to you?

00:30:16.955 --> 00:30:18.365
Does anybody else do that?

00:30:18.605 --> 00:30:22.685
Because we're so consumed with seeking
First what we have going on in our

00:30:22.685 --> 00:30:28.535
lives, which causes the worry, and so in
saying, seek first the kingdom of God.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:33.295
Seek first Jesus, when you
wake up, seek first Jesus.

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:36.095
When you have a worry
or a care in your life.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.740
Where do you go whenever
something goes wrong in your life,

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:40.790
where it causes you to worry?

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.580
Do you go to God or do you try to fix it?

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:48.110
Do you go to God or do you stew on it and
begin to be frustrated and consumed by it?

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:51.860
That's the question that he's asking
today, that he's asking us, do

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.570
you put your trust in Jesus or do
you put your trust in Jesus last?

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.340
I mean, trust me, I, I'm, I love
having things in my control.

00:30:58.345 --> 00:30:59.420
I love, that's just me.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.350
I'm a control person.

00:31:01.595 --> 00:31:04.820
But typically, so something happens and
I'm like, I wanna control the situation.

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:08.270
And then whenever it finally I
can't, that's when I go to God

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.570
and he's saying, whoa, whoa,
whoa, you got that out of place.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:17.720
Seek first the kingdom of God, knowing
that he will lead you and guide you.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:22.610
And as you seek God, he will lead you in
the direction to control, not control,

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:26.900
but to lead you to help the situation
or to walk through the situation.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.010
So we seeking, saying, seek first
the kingdom of God above all.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:32.660
And I say this over and over again.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:37.190
It's not about just seeking
Jesus, it's about saying, saying

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.250
no to worry and seeking Jesus.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.570
Sometimes we just keep
saying, I shouldn't worry.

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:42.170
I shouldn't worry.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:42.800
I shouldn't worry.

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:44.810
And all I'm doing is
worrying about worrying.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.250
So it's saying I shouldn't
worry because God's word says

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.630
seek first the kingdom of God.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:53.270
So I'm saying no to worry
and I'm saying yes to Jesus.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.150
It's two parts.

00:31:56.765 --> 00:31:58.655
Two parts when we look at this.

00:31:59.525 --> 00:32:03.305
So some of you may have just come to the
realization of the biggest problem with

00:32:03.305 --> 00:32:07.925
your worry is that you've never really
sought Jesus or you gave your life to

00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:11.055
Jesus and you have him at number three.

00:32:11.765 --> 00:32:14.135
Or if you're anything like me, sometimes
I put him at number 10 and I never

00:32:14.135 --> 00:32:18.875
get past seven in my daily tasks or
my daily process, or my daily times of

00:32:18.875 --> 00:32:21.305
worrying, and I've already done seven
other things to try to fix this worry,

00:32:21.305 --> 00:32:22.925
and God's ate and I didn't get there.

00:32:23.705 --> 00:32:25.205
Some of you may have realized that today.

00:32:26.095 --> 00:32:31.760
And it's upon us to move and to cry
out to God and to ask him to help us.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.950
So the question is, is this is if
I put my hope and trust in Jesus to

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:40.280
take care of what I'm worried about,
what's going to happen to worry?

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.600
What's going to happen to worry?

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.060
I wanna give you three things
before we head into imitation.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.740
Three things that will happen
when you worry Number one.

00:32:49.565 --> 00:32:52.415
When you begin to do a little bit
of research, Penn State actually

00:32:52.415 --> 00:32:53.525
did this research, and I love this.

00:32:53.525 --> 00:32:54.545
You'll see this in your notes.

00:32:54.875 --> 00:32:57.865
They did some research, over about a
month period where people wrote down all

00:32:57.865 --> 00:32:58.975
the things that they were worried about.

00:32:58.975 --> 00:33:00.805
And after 30 days, how
many of them came true?

00:33:01.705 --> 00:33:05.395
And I think it's around 91% of the things
that they worried about never came true.

00:33:05.875 --> 00:33:09.985
So if we take that statistic and
we think about this, when you worry

00:33:10.525 --> 00:33:13.945
nine outta 10 times, whatever you're
worried about will never come true.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.020
I think that's like, like that's,
that's something to think about this.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.320
So your worry though will rob
you of peace 100% of the time.

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:24.730
Kind of going back to that same statistic.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.840
So when we worry 90% of the
time, it won't come true.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.340
So then it goes on a little
bit and it says this the other

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.600
times what's gonna happen?

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:36.730
Well, sometimes it doesn't
happen as bad as we thought.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.710
You ever worry you're gonna fail a test?

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.580
I did that in college.

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:40.570
I'm gonna fail a test.

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:41.890
And I got like a 75.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:42.820
I didn't fail.

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:46.885
You ever think that you know, your
marriage is gonna fall a bar completely

00:33:46.885 --> 00:33:48.175
and we're gonna get a divorce?

00:33:48.235 --> 00:33:48.445
No.

00:33:48.445 --> 00:33:50.935
You just fought for a day
and the next day yet made up.

00:33:51.295 --> 00:33:54.835
I mean, sometimes we worry and
consume ourselves so much and

00:33:54.835 --> 00:33:57.085
it ends up just not being as bad
as we thought it was gonna be.

00:33:58.045 --> 00:33:59.215
Not as bad as we thought it was gonna be.

00:33:59.215 --> 00:34:02.246
So that's another alternative to
what can happen, right when we worry.

00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:04.795
But the last one, and here's
one that I think is the most

00:34:04.795 --> 00:34:10.315
difficult, what we worry about may
happen, but here's the cool part.

00:34:10.315 --> 00:34:12.655
God will get us through
it 100% of the time.

00:34:13.645 --> 00:34:19.285
See, if we don't worry about it, we can
now have peace, God's perfect peace.

00:34:19.465 --> 00:34:22.705
But when we worry about it, we're
guaranteed to lose 100% of our

00:34:22.705 --> 00:34:24.505
peace because we've lost that.

00:34:25.195 --> 00:34:28.195
But statistics will tell you
here that odds are the things we

00:34:28.195 --> 00:34:29.605
worry about will not come true.

00:34:29.785 --> 00:34:32.765
And even if they do, God will
get you through those things.

00:34:33.385 --> 00:34:33.605
So.

00:34:34.585 --> 00:34:36.985
So what's our response to this?

00:34:37.015 --> 00:34:37.375
Right.

00:34:38.265 --> 00:34:41.680
For some of us in this room, the
things we worry about, I, I can't even

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.850
imagine what you're worrying about.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.740
It could really be some tragic things.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.760
It could be some deep things that,
this sounds too simple to you, that

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.700
if you seek first the kingdom of
God, that he'll just take care of it.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.510
It's that simple.

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:56.660
No, it's something that I would
say this, I would add this in, and

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.240
this is not me adding to the Bible.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.590
I believe this is what Jesus is saying.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.470
Seek first the kingdom of God every day.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.980
This is not a one-time decision,
and I'll even say this, sometimes

00:35:05.985 --> 00:35:07.330
it seek first the kingdom of God.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:13.315
Every moment because we can't just
today, and this is my challenge to

00:35:13.315 --> 00:35:16.225
you during invitation, it's always
the time to respond and begin to seek

00:35:16.225 --> 00:35:18.205
the Lord and and cast off our worries.

00:35:18.415 --> 00:35:19.855
But you may do that on Sunday.

00:35:20.305 --> 00:35:23.395
But Monday's coming and
everybody knows what Monday is.

00:35:23.575 --> 00:35:25.285
Mondays are Mondays.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:28.945
Everybody had a Monday before and a
Tuesday and a Wednesday and a Thursday

00:35:28.945 --> 00:35:32.215
and a Friday and a Saturday and a Sunday
and another, it's all back around again.

00:35:32.245 --> 00:35:32.515
Okay?

00:35:32.695 --> 00:35:37.315
So what we take today is
important to apply every day.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.960
And every moment to keep this
in the front of our minds to

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.640
seek first thinking of, of God.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.470
Here's the thing, I understand.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:50.100
when you look at this and you, you think
about, taking your worry to God, what

00:35:50.105 --> 00:35:55.750
you're worried about is so difficult that
it's hard to do that, but I think Jesus.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.330
We will continue to remind you every
day that you seek him that he is better

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:01.800
than whatever you'll worry about.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:05.400
He is way better than whatever
is consuming your life.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:12.990
And so I know this is, that worry has
sucked the joy outta my life at times.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:17.040
And I have, I've just come to the
conclusion recently and the last, this

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.250
really this year, and this sounds so
crazy, you've been a pastor for how long?

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.710
But it's this year that
this is my statement.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:23.730
It's fine.

00:36:24.795 --> 00:36:30.195
There has been so much that's happened
in the last year, and I'm just like,

00:36:30.285 --> 00:36:34.365
I'm tired of emotionally going down
and then having this roller coaster

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:37.905
emotion up and then smaller roller
coaster down because of worry and

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:40.035
stress and anxiety and depress.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.735
I'm done with it, and so you know
what it is When something happens

00:36:43.005 --> 00:36:44.925
that I could worry about, it's fine.

00:36:46.485 --> 00:36:46.965
It's fine.

00:36:47.475 --> 00:36:51.975
And the reason why it's fine
is because God is not surprised

00:36:52.215 --> 00:36:53.025
by what I'm going through.

00:36:54.255 --> 00:36:55.755
God's not surprised by
what you're going through.

00:36:56.325 --> 00:36:59.145
We live in a sinful and broken
world and it is difficult.

00:37:00.255 --> 00:37:01.395
But you know where he said this?

00:37:01.395 --> 00:37:05.235
He says, the Gentiles seek these
things and worry about these things.

00:37:05.475 --> 00:37:08.025
And when I said the Gentiles, it is
the unbelievers people that don't know

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:11.445
Jesus and, and we should be broken
over people that don't know Jesus, who

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:15.975
worry and are consumed that when things
happen, they have nobody to go to.

00:37:17.175 --> 00:37:23.040
But as a believer, As a father of
Jesus, we have him and we know he

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.700
is in control, and he's saying,
don't worry about your finances.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.190
Don't worry about your food
or your fitness or your body.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.780
Don't worry about your future.

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.620
Whatever it is that you're worrying about,
he says to seek first the kingdom of God.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:40.650
I wanna challenge you to do that today
in this time of invitation, and I want

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:44.580
you to also just, maybe you need to say
the statement that I said this week.

00:37:45.435 --> 00:37:47.835
If you're worried about something,
you need to ask the Lord this

00:37:47.835 --> 00:37:50.085
question, do I trust you here?

00:37:52.065 --> 00:37:53.355
And maybe that's what the Lord's saying.

00:37:53.355 --> 00:37:56.085
Wherever worry, you're worrying
about, he has seen this.

00:37:56.085 --> 00:37:58.905
Do you trust me here in this
relationship that's broken?

00:37:58.905 --> 00:38:02.115
Do you trust me here in the future
of your life and your family?

00:38:02.735 --> 00:38:09.135
And maybe today you lay down and you
say, I believe, but help my unbelief.

00:38:10.215 --> 00:38:13.905
That is a hard statement because
sometimes it's hard to say that you trust.

00:38:14.015 --> 00:38:14.365
Jesus.

00:38:16.185 --> 00:38:16.755
So let's pray.

00:38:16.755 --> 00:38:18.615
Lord Jesus, we thank you Lord for today.

00:38:20.535 --> 00:38:24.285
We thank you that your,
your word is truth.

00:38:25.065 --> 00:38:28.785
And when we know that your
word is truth, we can read it.

00:38:29.355 --> 00:38:31.785
We can believe it in faith,
and we can experience it.

00:38:32.025 --> 00:38:35.265
So today your word says, don't worry.

00:38:36.195 --> 00:38:37.095
Your word says, don't worry.

00:38:40.155 --> 00:38:44.895
And Lord, I know right now across this
room, you're filling in the blank of

00:38:44.895 --> 00:38:47.385
whatever everyone's worrying about.

00:38:49.305 --> 00:38:52.215
And so, Lord, as they are thinking
about those things, Lord, I pray that

00:38:52.215 --> 00:38:54.615
right now as we continue to pray.

00:38:54.615 --> 00:38:58.035
Lord, I pray that they are casting
their cares on you, that they

00:38:58.035 --> 00:39:01.155
are taking those worries and that
they're handing them over to you.

00:39:02.175 --> 00:39:04.125
That they're laying them down
and they're saying, Lord, I

00:39:04.125 --> 00:39:05.415
don't wanna worry about this.

00:39:05.415 --> 00:39:08.325
I don't wanna worry about
my child or my marriage.

00:39:08.625 --> 00:39:11.715
I don't wanna worry about
my finances or my cars.

00:39:11.715 --> 00:39:13.005
I don't wanna worry about my job.

00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:16.755
I don't wanna worry about
my future and the unknown.

00:39:17.895 --> 00:39:22.575
Whatever it is, I'm, I'm challenging
all of you in this room to just begin

00:39:22.575 --> 00:39:26.295
to pray and to lay those things down at
Jesus' feet and say, I don't wanna worry.

00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:28.395
I don't wanna worry.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:35.610
Just take a few minutes right now and
just begin to ask the Lord to take that

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:36.780
worry from your heart and your mind

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:56.110
as we continue to pray.

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:58.110
Here's what I wanna
challenge you to do now.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:04.140
I, I challenge you to now say this, Lord,
I've cast my worry, whatever I'm worried

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:10.350
about, down to you, and I'm picking up,
seeking you first in that area, seeking

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:13.770
you first in my marriage, seeking you
first in my finances, seeking you first in

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:17.500
broken relationships, seeking you first in
my future and in my job that I'm worried

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:19.890
about or my family member or my child.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:24.120
Just begin to, to pray and
tell the Lord right now.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.130
Lord, I'm seeking you first here.

00:40:27.225 --> 00:40:32.085
I am placing you in the right place, not
second, not third, not after I figured

00:40:32.085 --> 00:40:33.675
it out, but Lord, I'm seeking you first.

00:40:33.675 --> 00:40:35.925
And so just take a few moments
to, to tell the Lord you're

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.055
seeking him first in those areas.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.800
The last thing is we continue
to just seek the Lord.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.860
I know there could be people in
this room that have never sought

00:41:10.865 --> 00:41:16.080
Jesus first ever, which means you've
never put your faith in Jesus.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:21.240
My pastor reminded me this so many
times before I gave my life to Jesus.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.910
There's never a better day to give
your life to Jesus than today.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.150
There's never a better day than to
give your life to Jesus than today.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.500
And so my challenge is, is if you
heard this message and you struggle

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.740
with not only worry, but you struggle
with just not having a relationship

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:38.130
with Jesus, you don't even know what
that is, that you came in this room

00:41:38.135 --> 00:41:42.330
as an believer that today you can
seek first God for the first time.

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:46.620
And so if you would like to give your life
to Jesus, if you would like to seek first.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:48.510
Jesus today, you can do that.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:52.260
I'm just gonna encourage you to raise
your hand, to raise your hand, to

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.980
commit that you wanna give your life
to Jesus, that you wanna put him

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.950
first in your life because you've
never done that in your life before.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:02.910
Today is an opportunity to stand boldly
to say you wanna give your life to Jesus.

00:42:16.755 --> 00:42:21.555
I wanna encourage you, every one of
you are professing that you believe in

00:42:21.555 --> 00:42:25.965
Jesus and that you trust him and that
you want to put him first in your life.

00:42:28.155 --> 00:42:32.505
So today, remember to take what
you've learned from God's word and

00:42:32.505 --> 00:42:35.995
not only apply it today, but every
day in every moment of your life.

00:42:36.625 --> 00:42:38.655
Lord Jesus, we thank you again for today.

00:42:38.655 --> 00:42:41.445
We thank you so much for your word.

00:42:41.445 --> 00:42:43.995
We thank you so much, Lord,
that you remind even me.

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.900
Lord this week.

00:42:45.905 --> 00:42:48.900
I don't know why you are doing
what you're doing in my life, but

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.190
Lord, I know you're doing it for a
reason and so I'm not gonna worry.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:58.710
I'm done with worry and I'm
gonna continue to seek you first.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:05.881
And Lord, I pray that every
person in this room did just that.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:11.355
Lord, I'm praying that every person in
this room, Responded to you and said,

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:13.965
Lord, that they wanna put you first
in the area where they're worrying.

00:43:14.175 --> 00:43:17.625
Lord, I pray that this transforms
them this week, and they begin

00:43:17.625 --> 00:43:21.825
to experience shalom, Shalom,
which is your perfect peace.

00:43:22.785 --> 00:43:26.115
God, I pray that over every person
that may, they may experience that

00:43:26.385 --> 00:43:27.736
a renewing relationship this week.

00:43:27.741 --> 00:43:30.315
Lord, change our lives.

00:43:31.125 --> 00:43:32.265
We pray this in Jesus name.

00:43:32.925 --> 00:43:33.255
Amen.

00:43:33.255 --> 00:43:34.635
Let's stand and let's worship.
