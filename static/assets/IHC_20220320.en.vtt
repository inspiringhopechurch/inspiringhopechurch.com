00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.800
Recently moved there after the residency.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.360
Uh, the beginning of the work
there, uh, to plant a church

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.880
called bridge bridge city church.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.720
Um, and so I'm excited for
you to hear from him today.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.120
Um, if you're wondering, why
is he sharing number one?

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.720
Because I love him and I'm thankful
to be able to hear from him.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.680
Number two.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.440
Um, I was dealing with some
sickness early this week.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.640
We had some mission teams in.

00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:19.755
I had no clue if I was
gonna have a voice today.

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:23.555
And so in because of that,
we know how the Lord works.

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:27.555
Um, I was able to ask Jonathan
to come and, and preach today.

00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:28.955
So I'm so thankful for him to come.

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:30.235
So I'm gonna have him come up here.

00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:31.395
I'm gonna pray for him.

00:00:31.854 --> 00:00:33.515
And then he's gonna have
a word to share with us.

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:36.665
So let's take a moment
to pray, Lord Jesus.

00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:38.905
We are so thankful Lord for you, Lord.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.665
We're so thankful for this time
to hear from Jonathan in the word.

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:43.625
Uh, Lord, I pray that
you speak through him.

00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:47.385
Use him mightily Lord, because
we know Lord, you have a word for

00:00:47.385 --> 00:00:48.905
each one of us Lord, including me.

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:50.385
And I'm praying that my heart is open.

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:53.425
I'm praying that all of our hearts are
open Lord to your word and your truth,

00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:55.025
and that we will leave out here change.

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:57.535
And so Lord, we praise
you and we thank you.

00:00:57.535 --> 00:00:58.575
And we pray this in your heaven name.

00:00:59.004 --> 00:00:59.295
Amen.

00:00:59.525 --> 00:00:59.815
Amen.

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:00.495
Amen.

00:01:00.754 --> 00:01:02.375
No, it is good to be
with you in this place.

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:05.175
We're gonna be in the book
of Ephesians chapter three.

00:01:05.914 --> 00:01:10.575
And as you turn over there, I'm
gonna start with a mouthful.

00:01:10.914 --> 00:01:12.655
I'm gonna tell you about
a guy named Louise Carlos

00:01:12.715 --> 00:01:15.375
dating Theone, KARE de Camra.

00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:17.805
I'm not doing it again.

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:18.325
One time.

00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:18.805
That was it.

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:19.685
That's all you get.

00:01:20.134 --> 00:01:25.835
Um, he was a Portuguese aristocrat
who died suddenly at the age of 42.

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:28.869
Years old when he died, he was a bachelor.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.830
He was unmarried.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.029
He did not have any children, nor
did he have any living relatives.

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:34.669
So you think, okay, so he's died.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.990
So anything that he owns, uh, that
remains all his possessions, things are

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.949
gonna be absorbed by the government.

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.949
Well, you would be wrong because
you see, he had, he had claimed some

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:46.470
folks to receive his inheritance.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.820
He, even though he didn't have the
normal, uh, family members in place

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.759
that maybe you would pass those things
along to 12 years prior, To his death.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.240
He picks out 70 people to
receive pieces of his estate if

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.440
he were, and when he would die.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.440
Now, how did he come up
with these 70 people?

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.519
One day he brought a couple of
folks over to serve his witnesses.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.840
He opened up a phone book and he began to
randomly select names out of the phone.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.630
And is these 70 people that 12
years later when he passed away

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.230
receives portions of his estate.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.350
So he had a 12 room.

00:02:23.585 --> 00:02:27.025
Apartment that was passed
out among these folks.

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:31.865
He had a house in Northern Portugal
that someone received, he had a car

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.145
and he had 25,000 euros in the bank.

00:02:34.485 --> 00:02:38.145
And this was his inheritance that
he had passed on, uh, to these

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:41.385
70 random folks along the way.

00:02:42.465 --> 00:02:45.875
So when an inheritance can be a good
thing and it can be a good thing

00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:47.275
for receive an inheritance, but.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.200
What I do with the inheritance
is just as important.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.320
If not more important than the fact that
I received an inheritance in the first

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.920
place, it's great to receive things.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.600
It's great to have resources, but
what I do with it, how I steward that

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.720
along the way matters just as much,
if not more than the fact that I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.670
was received it in the first place.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.230
I'll give you an example.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.989
Another mouthful here,
Huntington Hartford.

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.700
The second Huntington Hartford.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.070
The second, if you can't tell this guy,
he grew up wealthy, his it's in his name.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.190
He grew up with money.

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.269
So when his dad passed away, he
was 11 years old and his dad left

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.709
him $90 million as an inheritance.

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:34.255
So he grows up, he goes to school.

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:38.775
He is well educated, but he is not
so savvy when it comes to business.

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:41.855
So along the way, he had some
business opportunities and projects

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:45.735
and passion projects that he gave
hisself to his time to, and his

00:03:45.735 --> 00:03:47.935
money to, and they did not pan out.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.470
For example, he had a real
estate deal in The Bahamas.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.310
He sunk 30 million into that and got
nothing out of it lost all 30 million.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.550
He wanted to start a modeling agency.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.950
And so he started that and it ended up
falling through and it wasn't very good.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:09.660
And so by 1992, he filed bankruptcy
and was forced to move out of his wanky

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.660
living quarters and into a kind of a
broken down apartment along the way.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.300
And so an inheritance is great.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.709
Resources are great.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.710
What we do with them matter
just as much as the fact that I

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.670
received them in the first place.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.430
And that is stewardship.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.190
Stewardship is how I handle the
things that have been given to me.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.190
And that applies to all aspects of
life, not just financial things, but

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.740
with my time and with my gifts and
with, with the family that have been

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.780
born into the job, all these different
things, these different aspects of life.

00:04:41.854 --> 00:04:45.275
Are affected by how I steward them.

00:04:45.294 --> 00:04:48.875
And so today in this place, we're
gonna look at the good news of the

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:52.034
gospel through the lens of stewardship.

00:04:53.534 --> 00:04:56.474
How I handle the things
that have been given to me.

00:04:56.474 --> 00:04:59.835
And so the title for today's
message is stewards of mystery.

00:04:59.935 --> 00:05:03.275
Now we're gonna talk about this a little
more here in a minute, but in this

00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:07.075
passage, the possible Paul is gonna
talk about mystery as being the gospel

00:05:07.465 --> 00:05:09.195
that you can't understand all of it.

00:05:09.195 --> 00:05:10.034
And that it's a, a.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:13.785
Faith aspect to it and that the
blessings and the benefit of it

00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:15.265
are beyond our comprehension.

00:05:15.265 --> 00:05:18.865
And so there's just some mystery about
the gospel about why would God would

00:05:18.865 --> 00:05:21.745
do it in the first place and how it
worked and all these different things.

00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:25.785
And so interchangeably, we're gonna
use the words, gospel and mystery,

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.545
uh, throughout this time today.

00:05:27.565 --> 00:05:30.975
And so let's read together six
verses and Ephesians to chapter.

00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:34.545
And then we'll talk about three
different truths that we see from

00:05:34.545 --> 00:05:38.625
the passage of that will help
us be stewards of the mystery.

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:42.785
So let's read together Ephesians
chapter three, starting in verse one.

00:05:43.215 --> 00:05:48.705
Paul says for this reason I Paul, a
prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf

00:05:48.705 --> 00:05:52.465
of the Gentiles, assuming that you
have heard of the stewardship of

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:55.175
grace that was given to me for you.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.740
How the mystery was made
known to me by revelation.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.219
As I have written briefly, when you
read this, you can perceive my insight

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.659
into the mystery of Christ, which
was not made known to the sons of men

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.500
in other generations, as it is now
been revealed to his holy apostles

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.770
and the prophets by the spirit six.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.890
This mystery is the
Gentiles are fellow heirs.

00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:25.164
Members of the same body and
partakers of the promise.

00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:28.865
In Christ Jesus through the gospel.

00:06:30.085 --> 00:06:34.065
So Paul he's writing a letter
to a group of believers in ESUs.

00:06:34.295 --> 00:06:36.945
They are Gentile believers,
which means they are not Jewish.

00:06:37.005 --> 00:06:39.025
So they're like a lot of us in this room.

00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:39.705
We're not Jewish.

00:06:39.845 --> 00:06:40.545
We are Gentile.

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:44.625
And so he is writing to a group of people
who for a long time had not been allowed.

00:06:45.085 --> 00:06:49.025
To even have salvation to have access,
to go into the temple along the way.

00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:51.465
And so he is gonna write, and he's
saying, look, you have been, now

00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:55.344
you're the recipients of this,
my, this grace of this salvation.

00:06:55.655 --> 00:06:58.705
It's now available to you in
a time when it wasn't before.

00:06:58.724 --> 00:06:59.905
And so he is gonna break it down.

00:06:59.905 --> 00:07:02.224
He says, look, you gotta be
a steward of the mystery.

00:07:02.224 --> 00:07:06.375
And so let's talk today, three
truths about stewarding the

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:09.575
mystery and stewarding the gospel,
because if it has been given to

00:07:09.575 --> 00:07:11.534
us, then we have to do something.

00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:12.655
With it.

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:15.734
So the first truth we see in
this passage is this that we've

00:07:15.734 --> 00:07:17.135
gotta have the right reason.

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:22.015
We've gotta have the right reason if
I'm gonna appropriately and do a good

00:07:22.015 --> 00:07:25.614
job of stewarding the gospel, then
I've gotta have the right reason.

00:07:25.755 --> 00:07:28.775
My motivation has gotta be correct.

00:07:29.354 --> 00:07:30.094
Paul's starting here.

00:07:30.094 --> 00:07:32.054
He's talking about the
privilege of proclamation.

00:07:32.344 --> 00:07:33.804
He starts in the very first verse.

00:07:33.804 --> 00:07:35.405
He said, for this reason I, Paul.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.680
I'm telling you this.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.200
And he is saying, look, it's a joy
and a privilege to be able to share

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.120
this, that regardless of where I find
myself in life, I am going to have

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:47.960
joy in it because it Springs from God.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.440
We see this in the very first word he
says, for this reason he's referring to

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.120
the work that Jesus did on the cross.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:59.030
He's refer to what Jesus
did by offering salvation.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.270
And so basically he's
saying everything I do.

00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:05.945
Stems from and flows out
the fact of what Jesus did.

00:08:06.655 --> 00:08:12.065
It's all because of him, it's a privilege
to do what I do because of Jesus and

00:08:12.065 --> 00:08:16.705
because of what Jesus did, I can now
do what it is he has called me to do.

00:08:16.925 --> 00:08:21.344
And so Paul's, apostleship his office
has his leadership, his role that

00:08:21.344 --> 00:08:22.825
God had given him, it determined.

00:08:23.385 --> 00:08:26.364
All aspects of his life.

00:08:26.784 --> 00:08:28.484
It influenced his relationships.

00:08:28.784 --> 00:08:33.405
It influenced where he, how he worked
and where he worked and what he did.

00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:37.804
And throughout his letters, we
see his understanding of this.

00:08:37.855 --> 00:08:40.924
There was a phrase that he would use
that would come up over and over again,

00:08:40.924 --> 00:08:44.115
that kind of showed, uh, I am who I'm.

00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:46.954
I said, I am, I'm doing what
I've said I was going to do.

00:08:46.954 --> 00:08:50.920
And so he would say in his letters, I
Paul, there were different times and that

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.600
was always kind of his way to help them
remember who it was, who was speaking

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.360
and what had happened along the way.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.160
And that he's speaking with the
authority as being called by God

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.240
to give this message to the people.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.959
And so just give you a couple
examples of what that looked

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:05.800
like, uh, in play right here.

00:09:05.819 --> 00:09:13.459
So in second Corinthians chapter 10, verse
one, he says, I, Paul myself treat you by

00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:15.699
the meekness and the gentleness of Christ.

00:09:16.595 --> 00:09:21.645
Over in Galatians five, verse two,
he says, look, I Paul, say to you

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:26.565
that if you accept circumcision,
Christ will be no advantage to you.

00:09:27.595 --> 00:09:33.755
A third example, Colosians 1 23 says if
indeed you continue in faith, stable and

00:09:33.835 --> 00:09:38.505
steadfast, not shifting from the hope
of a gospel that you, which has been

00:09:38.505 --> 00:09:44.465
proclaimed in all creation under heaven
and of which I, Paul became a minister.

00:09:45.694 --> 00:09:47.555
And he says it in our,
our verse one right here.

00:09:47.555 --> 00:09:49.954
He said for this reason I, Paul.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.109
All the time.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:57.150
He was always reminding them of who he
was not for his glory, because he believed

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:02.270
everything he was doing was being sent out
by God that God had given him this role.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.670
God had given him this message.

00:10:03.689 --> 00:10:06.589
And so he's all the time
pointing back saying, it's me.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.020
Paul, you know, the guy that
God's given this message to.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.340
And so that's the authority
that I'm speaking in for him.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.780
He wasn't saying it's in my authority
by saying I, Paul he's pointing

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.340
back to Jesus in Jesus authority.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.060
And so Paul viewed his life through
the lens of apostleship, which

00:10:23.079 --> 00:10:25.100
was an extension of salvation.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.130
You see, he had an encounter
with Jesus on the, a Damascus

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.329
road that changed his life.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.120
It changed his life spiritually.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.479
It changed his life physically.

00:10:32.479 --> 00:10:34.479
It changed his life geographically.

00:10:34.479 --> 00:10:37.719
And for the rest of his life,
he, he changed what he was about.

00:10:37.819 --> 00:10:41.719
He was walking one path and then
Jesus got a hold of his life and he

00:10:41.719 --> 00:10:43.079
put him on a completely new path.

00:10:43.099 --> 00:10:45.280
And we'll talk a little
more, more about that.

00:10:45.459 --> 00:10:49.359
But from that point forward, it was
all about the gospel and it was all

00:10:49.359 --> 00:10:55.390
about the, the mystery here and that it
being a steward of that along the way.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.790
And so everything that he did.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.800
Float out of salvation.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.920
Jesus filled up every crevice of his
life to the point where a little bit

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.440
later in chapter three in verse 13, he's
gonna be able to say, so I ask you not

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.480
to lose heart over what I am suffering
for you, which is for your glory.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.200
So what's he suffering when
he's writing this letter?

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.200
He is in prison.

00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:23.194
He is currently at the, at the time
that he's pinning this letter to these,

00:11:23.615 --> 00:11:25.675
uh, folks in Ephesus, he is in prison.

00:11:25.735 --> 00:11:26.595
He is in chains.

00:11:26.735 --> 00:11:26.955
Why?

00:11:26.955 --> 00:11:30.515
Because he's preaching this
message of the gospel because he's

00:11:30.515 --> 00:11:32.875
stewarding the message of the gospel.

00:11:33.335 --> 00:11:36.715
And there's folks that don't like the
idea that Gentiles are, can now have

00:11:36.955 --> 00:11:40.465
salvation there's folks that are saying,
no, that's not the way we've been told.

00:11:40.465 --> 00:11:43.225
That's not what we've understood
it to be for all of these years.

00:11:43.485 --> 00:11:46.265
You're introducing something
new and we don't like that.

00:11:46.285 --> 00:11:46.585
And so.

00:11:46.969 --> 00:11:48.120
We're gonna have you arrested.

00:11:48.219 --> 00:11:50.920
And so he is currently in chains as he's.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:56.599
He is in prison writing this letter and
he's able to say it is for God's glory and

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.319
I am a prisoner in Christ and it's okay.

00:11:58.814 --> 00:12:03.265
He's able to find a way to be content
in the middle of this because Paul

00:12:03.275 --> 00:12:09.824
understood that to be in Christ was more
important than his outward circumstances.

00:12:10.235 --> 00:12:10.584
Right.

00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:13.865
He says that in, he says,
I am a prisoner for Christ.

00:12:14.204 --> 00:12:15.305
So he's suffering.

00:12:15.525 --> 00:12:18.425
And in verse 13, he's saying it's
okay, because it's for your glory.

00:12:18.425 --> 00:12:21.615
It's for benefit because you're
gonna get to know about the

00:12:21.615 --> 00:12:23.495
glorious message of salvation.

00:12:23.594 --> 00:12:27.895
And if it requires me to be in prison
for that to happen, then it's worthwhile.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:29.220
It's okay.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.340
And so the same thing is true for
us to be in Christ, wherever it is,

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.100
he has us is better than whatever
the outward circumstances that are

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.060
going on in my life at that time.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.430
And having the right reason allows us
to accept our situation so that we can

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:53.780
phone focus on what it is God wants to do
with us in the middle of that situation.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.420
It allows us to be content.

00:12:56.155 --> 00:13:00.094
It helps us focus on, uh, not
on what distracts us from what

00:13:00.094 --> 00:13:03.935
God desires to do in us, but to
focus on what he wants us do.

00:13:03.935 --> 00:13:07.214
And so many times it's easy to get
distracted about things that are going

00:13:07.214 --> 00:13:10.935
on, especially when circumstances
aren't ideal when things aren't the way

00:13:10.935 --> 00:13:13.574
we would wish for them to be, or the
way that we would hope for them to be.

00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:16.055
And life is hard and it stinks.

00:13:16.515 --> 00:13:17.925
It's painful along the way.

00:13:17.925 --> 00:13:19.444
And we're in situations
that we don't want.

00:13:19.474 --> 00:13:21.285
It's easy to be distracted.

00:13:22.185 --> 00:13:25.084
Do you know anybody that
has a hard time on Mondays?

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.939
You find people that have
just a hard time on Mondays.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.740
I used to work with a
lady to bless her heart.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.060
She just struggled on Mondays.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.180
She began struggling about
Monday on Saturday night, like

00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:39.020
it was coming around the bin.

00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:41.219
And so everything was about Monday.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.540
And if it was negative, it
was cuz it was a Monday.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.010
And if something really good happened,
it was like, well, I can't go believe

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.530
that actually happened on a Monday.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.250
And it was all the time and it influenced.

00:13:50.905 --> 00:13:52.285
Her entire attitude.

00:13:52.505 --> 00:13:56.045
And so like, she always got to work
late on Monday and she was like, well,

00:13:56.045 --> 00:13:57.285
it's a Monday, what do you expect?

00:13:57.285 --> 00:14:00.125
And it's like, it's just like in the other
day, like, come on, let's go to work.

00:14:00.385 --> 00:14:02.285
And it was just always so negative.

00:14:02.305 --> 00:14:03.564
And I, of course that happened.

00:14:03.595 --> 00:14:04.125
It's a Monday.

00:14:04.745 --> 00:14:08.325
And you know what scripture would
say, Psalm 1 18 24 says, this is

00:14:08.325 --> 00:14:09.605
the day that the Lord has made.

00:14:09.725 --> 00:14:11.005
I should rejoice in.

00:14:11.255 --> 00:14:11.995
Be glad in it.

00:14:12.495 --> 00:14:17.595
God made Mondays, Mondays are great days,
but for her it had become a distraction.

00:14:18.334 --> 00:14:22.505
Nothing good was gonna happen on a Monday,
nothing beneficial, nothing kingdom,

00:14:22.655 --> 00:14:24.665
mind, kingdom oriented could happen.

00:14:25.285 --> 00:14:26.745
God doesn't work on Mondays.

00:14:26.745 --> 00:14:27.704
He takes Monday off.

00:14:27.704 --> 00:14:29.185
That's why everything's bad's happening.

00:14:29.185 --> 00:14:29.385
Right?

00:14:29.724 --> 00:14:34.385
So when we have the right reason,
we stay focused in on what

00:14:34.385 --> 00:14:35.984
it is that God desires to do.

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:41.175
Even on a Monday, even in the
midst of hard circumstances.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.170
Because having the right reason, it
allows me to operate in my current

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.199
situation to the best of my ability,
which opens the door for God to

00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:53.640
work to the best of his ability.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:15:00.670
I'm gonna say that again, having the
right reason allows me to operate in

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:05.339
my current circumstance to the best of
my ability, which opens the door for

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:07.579
God to work to the best of his ability.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.290
A good example of this is in the old
Testament, the book of Daniel with three

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.290
guys named Shaak me, Shaq, and a Bendigo.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.730
They had been taken captive and
been taken to another country.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.210
But while they're there, they're
experiencing the favor of God to the

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:25.010
point where the king really enjoys
them and has them around in his court.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.610
And he kind of dos on them and
he likes them along the way.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.840
So the, the locals don't like that.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.320
And so they're out to get
'em and so they set 'em up.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.080
They set a trap to get them either thrown
in prison or to be killed because they

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.480
don't like the fact that these foreigners
have come in and their own king likes them

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.560
more than they like, then he likes them.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.040
And so the trap was this.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.840
They said, look, they knew how
faithful they were to following.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:48.670
God.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.630
And so they said, we're gonna make
it a, a rule in a law that everyone's

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.230
gotta bow down and worship the king.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.710
And so the king says, that sounds good.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.590
Let's do that.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.790
So they put this law into place
and these three guys refused to do

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.750
that to the best of their ability.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.990
They were being obedient to
what God had given them to do

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.470
regardless of the circumstance.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.590
So their arrest.

00:16:09.204 --> 00:16:11.984
And they're gonna be thrown into a
fire and they're gonna be in this

00:16:11.984 --> 00:16:14.864
big, giant furnace and they're gonna
be killed, and that's gonna be the

00:16:14.864 --> 00:16:18.944
consequences for their, uh, their
actions of being obedient to God.

00:16:18.964 --> 00:16:23.224
And so to the best of their ability,
they go to the furnace, doing exactly

00:16:23.224 --> 00:16:24.944
what it is God had called them to do.

00:16:25.214 --> 00:16:30.135
They find themselves at the brink of
death, but because they had done what

00:16:30.135 --> 00:16:33.694
God had called him to do it cleared out
space for God to do what only he could do.

00:16:34.505 --> 00:16:36.365
So it says that they get
thrown into the furnace.

00:16:37.064 --> 00:16:40.005
And then we pick up the story in
Daniel chapter three, verse 24

00:16:40.115 --> 00:16:42.485
king Neah Neer was astonished.

00:16:42.705 --> 00:16:44.005
He rose up and haste.

00:16:44.145 --> 00:16:45.925
He declared to his counselors.

00:16:46.345 --> 00:16:50.285
Did we not cast three
men bound into the fire?

00:16:51.194 --> 00:16:53.295
And they answered and they
said to the king, it's true.

00:16:53.314 --> 00:16:53.694
Oh, king.

00:16:54.115 --> 00:17:00.605
He answered and said, but I see four men
Unbound walking in the midst of the fire.

00:17:01.385 --> 00:17:02.325
And they are not hurt.

00:17:02.545 --> 00:17:05.845
And the appearance of the fourth
is like the son of the gods.

00:17:06.915 --> 00:17:13.045
When we steward what God has given us
with the right reason, then we don't

00:17:13.045 --> 00:17:17.405
get distracted by the, the circumstances
we don't become discontented.

00:17:17.785 --> 00:17:22.365
We are all in on what he's given us to do,
because what he has given you to do today,

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.740
Is an extension of his gift of salvation.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.700
If he has, if he has saved you
and you've received the gifts of

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.340
salvation, then he has a role for you.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.580
And he has a desire and
a plan for your life.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.540
And so when we walk that path, even
when circumstances are hard, it sets the

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.780
stage for him to do what only he can do.

00:17:41.595 --> 00:17:45.095
It says that the fire in this
furnace that they had cranked

00:17:45.095 --> 00:17:46.495
it up even hotter than normal.

00:17:46.635 --> 00:17:49.735
To the point, it was like six times
higher to the point that when the

00:17:49.795 --> 00:17:53.255
guards who came and threw these
three guys into the fire, the guards

00:17:53.255 --> 00:17:55.255
were consumed and died by the fire.

00:17:55.395 --> 00:17:57.095
That's how hot it was.

00:17:57.435 --> 00:17:59.975
So not only did they not die, it
says when they pulled them out,

00:17:59.975 --> 00:18:02.605
their clothes were not sinned and
they didn't even smell like smoke.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.260
God did a work that only he could do.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.380
And he was able to do that because these
three guys did exactly what they could do.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:13.140
They could be obedient even to
the point of dying in a furnace.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.060
And so when they walked that
path, God showed up and did

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.340
a work that only he can do.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.620
And so Paul, in this letter, he's
talking about the example of stewardship

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.890
and living a life that's based
upon what Christ has done for us.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.570
And we should see it as
a challenge to examine.

00:18:29.565 --> 00:18:30.825
Our level of stewardship.

00:18:31.405 --> 00:18:33.105
So why did I get up this morning?

00:18:33.845 --> 00:18:35.585
What's my agenda for today.

00:18:35.605 --> 00:18:37.905
What's my motivation for today.

00:18:38.045 --> 00:18:40.785
Why am I moving around
and doing stuff today?

00:18:40.785 --> 00:18:42.985
What am I trying to get out of today?

00:18:42.985 --> 00:18:43.865
What are, what is it?

00:18:43.865 --> 00:18:47.105
That's motivating my actions
because Paul is saying it's all

00:18:47.105 --> 00:18:48.665
tied to what God has done for me.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:53.199
everything that I do every moment
of every day is attached to

00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:55.919
the fact that Jesus saved me.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.560
That's my motivation.

00:18:57.939 --> 00:19:01.720
That's how I'm gonna steward the
gospel is that it's all connected.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.000
And so for us in this place,
how are we stewarding?

00:19:06.209 --> 00:19:10.459
Because he's talked earlier in this letter
about some of the purpose of each day,

00:19:11.209 --> 00:19:16.620
each day, my purpose should be to build
the temple of God at the end of chapter

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:22.179
two, he's referencing the temple as an,
an illustration of who we are in Christ.

00:19:22.439 --> 00:19:22.780
And so.

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:24.395
And other letters.

00:19:24.395 --> 00:19:26.755
He said, we are a body and then
all believers are connected.

00:19:27.055 --> 00:19:31.315
And as the body of Christ, but in
this letter, he references and uses

00:19:31.315 --> 00:19:33.755
the idea of a building of a temple.

00:19:33.775 --> 00:19:35.595
And he said, Jesus is the cornerstone.

00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:36.635
He's the first stone.

00:19:36.655 --> 00:19:40.555
And from that, every believer
that comes into the family of God.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.960
Is a stone that builds upon the
cornerstone and God is constructing

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:47.960
this temple made up of the
lives of people who choose him.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.880
And so we, every single day are
trying to build the temple of God.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.480
We're trying to, as a corporate bodies
being built into a giant temple, we're

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.760
trying as individual lives of Christians
are being developed into temples.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.030
So I'm trying to invest
in the sin of Jesus.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.910
I wanna live.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.180
On mission.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.700
I'm gonna realize that God has a
role for me to play in his, his

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:13.500
goal is to save those who are lost
and he has a role for me in that.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.140
And so I'm at all times seeking to bring
new people in I'm all times trying to

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:23.340
share the gospel, serve the loss, express
the love of Jesus and be obedient to

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.530
the, that God gives me on a daily basis.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:26.850
So every single day.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.560
My life should be about that investing
in the mission of Jesus, but it should

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.439
also include investing in my temple.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:37.280
Paul would also say at the end of chapter
two, that you individually are a temple

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:42.959
because you house God, God, his spirit
lives within you when you receive Jesus.

00:20:43.459 --> 00:20:46.360
And so you are a temple,
a living, breathing.

00:20:46.895 --> 00:20:48.375
Habitat for God.

00:20:48.395 --> 00:20:52.735
And so not only do we wanna seek to
build up the larger temple that is

00:20:52.735 --> 00:20:57.335
made up of, uh, individual followers of
Jesus, but we want to develop our life

00:20:57.675 --> 00:21:01.335
as a, a residing place as a resting
place, as a place where God lives.

00:21:01.335 --> 00:21:02.175
And so how do I do that?

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.240
I pray.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.680
I spend time in prayer talking
to the father, allowing him to

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.200
shape and guide and direct me.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.280
And when I pray, I don't
just talk the whole time.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:13.080
Sometimes I listen and allow him to speak.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.280
I heard a pastor this week,
somebody asked him and said, in

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.720
your 30 years of ministry, what
would you have done differently?

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.560
And he said in my 30 years of
ministry, what I would've done

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.190
differently is I would've prayed more.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.870
I would've planned less.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:26.850
I would've prayed more.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:28.250
I would've planned less.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:32.130
You wanna build up the temple of your
life into something that God can use.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.010
We need to pray more.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.410
I need to read my Bible
and not just read it.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.730
I need to meditate on scripture.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.170
There's gonna be some verses
along the way that holy Spirit's

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:40.850
gonna point out and say, Hey.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.370
We need to do something with this verse,
and you're just gonna take some time to

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:45.730
think about it and what that looks like.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:50.250
And so we wanna meditate on that and
allow him to, to shape us and to guide us.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.730
And then we wanna be, uh, obedient
to what he's given us to do and be

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.810
connected to a local church, just like
this one that follows scripture, that

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:02.360
honors God and all that they do, and
be connected and serve in that way.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.040
And so if I'm gonna be a steward
of the gospel, it's gonna start

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:07.800
with me having the right reason.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.800
I'm gonna have the right motivation.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.060
Secondly, I'm gonna give
away what I receive.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.660
I'm gonna give away what I
receive in verse two and three.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.780
We see that he said, assuming that
you've heard of the stewardship of God's

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:26.100
grace, that was given to me for you,
how the mystery was made, known to me by

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.820
revelation, as I have written briefly.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.510
So he is dwelling on his call
as an apostle to the Gentiles.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.990
See God gave him a direct
mission for these folks.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:39.150
The folks that had been outside
of the nation of Israel, the

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.950
ones that weren't allowed and
had access to God in the temple.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:47.230
And so from his view, he'd been entrusted
with a special office, a special calling.

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:52.980
He gets to be the first that brings kinda
this revolutionary idea to these people.

00:22:53.675 --> 00:22:56.815
And it stemmed back just like in,
we talked about just a minute ago,

00:22:56.815 --> 00:22:58.215
it stemmed back from his calling.

00:22:58.515 --> 00:23:02.455
So let's read together over in the book
of acts chapter nine, cuz I want you

00:23:02.455 --> 00:23:06.535
to see kind of the descriptor of what's
going on, cuz it helps us understand

00:23:06.555 --> 00:23:11.455
how passionate and how motivated he is
as he's being a steward of this gospel.

00:23:11.635 --> 00:23:16.965
So in acts chapter nine one, it
says this, but Paul was still

00:23:16.965 --> 00:23:18.565
breathing, threats and murder.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.500
Against the disciples of the Lord.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.860
He went to the high priest and he
asked him for letters to the synagogues

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.620
at Damascus, so that if he found
any belonging to the way meaning

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:34.540
followers of Jesus or women, he
might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.620
Now, as he went on his way, he
approached Damascus and suddenly

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.850
a light from heaven flashed around
him and falling to the ground.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:47.050
He heard a voice saying to him,
SA SA, why are you persecuting me?

00:23:47.565 --> 00:23:49.265
And he said, who are you Lord?

00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:54.905
And he said, I am Jesus, whom you are
persecuting, but rise and enter the city.

00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:57.465
And you will be told what you are to do.

00:23:58.534 --> 00:24:01.835
Now verse seven, the men who were
traveling with him stood speechless,

00:24:01.835 --> 00:24:05.195
hearing the voice, but seeing no
one Saul rose from the ground.

00:24:05.215 --> 00:24:07.514
And although his eyes were
opened, he saw nothing.

00:24:07.895 --> 00:24:11.314
So they laid him by the hand
and brought him into Damascus.

00:24:11.695 --> 00:24:16.635
And for three days he was without
sight and neither eight nor drank.

00:24:17.175 --> 00:24:19.784
So he has this encount, her
with God that changed his life.

00:24:21.215 --> 00:24:24.115
And so right after that, God sends
a guy and it gives instruction

00:24:24.135 --> 00:24:27.875
to a guy named Ananias says, Hey,
this thing has happened to Saul.

00:24:28.135 --> 00:24:29.195
His life has been changed.

00:24:29.655 --> 00:24:32.955
You need to go and lay hands
on him and pray over him so

00:24:32.955 --> 00:24:34.115
that he can regain his sight.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.340
Now Ananias knows the reputation
of Saul, that he is a murderer.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.500
He is a guy, a persecutor of
Christians, of people just like him.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.300
And so he barks at that idea
is like, ah, I don't think so.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.060
That's not the guy I'm gonna go visit.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.140
I don't care if you say he is blind
or what I'm not going, but then

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.300
God responds and gives kind of
the punchline to the whole deal.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.740
God says go.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.650
But he is so a chosen instrument
of mine to carry my name before the

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.250
Gentiles and the Kings and the children.

00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:02.455
Of Israel.

00:25:03.235 --> 00:25:04.575
God had saved Paul.

00:25:04.675 --> 00:25:09.255
He changed his life for one
specific reason so that Gentiles

00:25:09.255 --> 00:25:10.695
could know about the gospel.

00:25:11.565 --> 00:25:14.815
That was his calling and it
shaped everything that he had.

00:25:14.815 --> 00:25:16.935
And so he was told this by God.

00:25:16.935 --> 00:25:19.535
And so then he spent the rest
of his life telling other

00:25:19.535 --> 00:25:21.135
people what he had been told.

00:25:21.355 --> 00:25:25.245
He was give away that,
which he had received.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:30.970
. And so he says in here, don't assume,
or he says, assuming you have heard,

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:32.290
so that's what he is referencing.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.090
Is that assuming you've
heard what happened?

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:35.250
God showed up.

00:25:36.315 --> 00:25:37.935
To me and gave us a message.

00:25:38.195 --> 00:25:41.655
And it's a game changer, assuming
you've heard all of those things.

00:25:41.915 --> 00:25:44.335
That's why I'm now saying what it is.

00:25:44.435 --> 00:25:44.815
I'm saying.

00:25:45.155 --> 00:25:48.895
So a couple of just side observations
for us about this idea of assuming

00:25:49.115 --> 00:25:52.335
my father, one of the favorite
things he likes to say is assumption

00:25:52.475 --> 00:25:54.495
is the lowest form of knowledge.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:00.860
If he said it, once he said it 975,000
times in my lifetime, and almost all

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.100
of them were directed towards me.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.380
And so assumption is the
lowest form of knowledge.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.140
And so I'm not getting on de Paul for say.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:12.060
And assuming you've heard, I'm just saying
for us, let's not assume some stuff.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:16.090
Let's not assume that everybody
understands exactly what the gospel means.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.720
So let's go ahead and say it.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:18.960
Let's go ahead and share it.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.920
Let's not assume let's not assume
everybody knows your testimony.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.880
Let's not assume that everybody
knows exactly what God's

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.040
doing in your life right now.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:31.000
Those are things that need to be on
the forefront of your mouth and on your

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.600
lips so that people can hear, because
we don't wanna assume that everybody

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.190
understands that the gospels boil
down to the fact that Jesus loves you.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.310
So very much that even though
you were separated from him

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.350
because of sin in your life.

00:26:42.629 --> 00:26:43.720
That he bridged the gap.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.639
Then he made it possible for you
to have relationship with him

00:26:46.639 --> 00:26:48.480
because he loves you that much.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:53.400
And so to bridge the gap, he sent Jesus to
die on a cross that even though he didn't

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.040
deserve to die, he'd done nothing wrong.

00:26:55.139 --> 00:26:56.800
He lived sinless life.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:57.480
He paid.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.470
The debt for sin for you and I,
he paid the price that you and I

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:05.389
deserved to pay, but then three days
later, God raised him back to life

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.310
and in the process defeated death.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.149
So now you don't have to die
spiritually and be separated from him.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.310
And when you physically die,
you will no longer be separated.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.190
You will be with him
in heaven and in glory.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.980
And so we're able to have a relationship
with him now and experience him now.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.100
And then we get to experience him
even more in complete fulfillment.

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:26.300
When we see him face to face.

00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:27.570
And that is the gospel.

00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:30.889
And Romans, Tim would say the
only way, the only thing you gotta

00:27:30.889 --> 00:27:33.810
do to be saved is to believe you
gotta believe that he was, God, you

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:34.889
gotta believe that he was perfect.

00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:36.850
You gotta believe that he was he, he died.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:38.889
And then three days later,
he raised back to life.

00:27:38.889 --> 00:27:42.210
And if you believe that and you
confess it, you're saved, that's it.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.409
But let's not assume that
everybody knows that.

00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:46.649
So we need to have that conversation.

00:27:46.649 --> 00:27:51.520
We to share, if it's that good news, then
I need to share it on a regular basis.

00:27:52.209 --> 00:27:54.240
There is power in your testimony.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.919
There is power in you sharing the stories
of what God has done in your life.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:02.040
What God is teaching you and doing in
your life right now, and what you're

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.840
believing him for down the road.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:06.399
There are people that
need to hear your story.

00:28:06.429 --> 00:28:10.120
It's going to empower them and
bolster them and give them courage

00:28:10.419 --> 00:28:12.120
to take the next step in their story.

00:28:13.389 --> 00:28:15.220
There is power in your testimony.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.379
You need to hear your testimony.

00:28:17.379 --> 00:28:21.020
Sometimes one of the things that I've
found is then this last year is that

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.699
I give testimony to what God is doing.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.139
It empowers me and it happened to
me, but I'm being reminded of it

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.939
in the moment of how God was faith.

00:28:29.419 --> 00:28:32.800
And how God did a thing that only
he can do, which gives me fuel and

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.760
motivation to be courageous, to
step into the next thing that he's

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.919
asking me to do that only he can do.

00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:41.760
And so not only does it encourage
and empower other people, but it

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.959
can do the same for you, even though
it has already happened to you.

00:28:45.979 --> 00:28:51.070
So let's not assume that everybody always
knows exactly what all is going on.

00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:52.949
I do this with my wife all the time.

00:28:52.949 --> 00:28:55.310
We'll be at dinner and I'll be
telling a story and she'll look at

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.270
me and she'll go, I didn't know that.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:57.730
You didn't tell me that.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:01.290
And it's because I assume I've told her
already, I tell all these other people

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.810
and she ends up being the last one.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:07.890
So don't assume that you are, that
everybody knows your story matters.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.290
Your story is important.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.130
Your story is intended to be shared.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:21.560
And when we, we are giving
away what we have received.

00:29:22.354 --> 00:29:24.655
And we are stewarding the gospel.

00:29:25.554 --> 00:29:29.014
The flow of the gospel is not
intended to stop with you.

00:29:29.125 --> 00:29:29.415
It's.

00:29:30.515 --> 00:29:34.845
When, uh, I was graduating from
seminary back in 2011, I attended

00:29:34.985 --> 00:29:38.565
an extension center for new Orleans
Baptist, theological seminary.

00:29:38.845 --> 00:29:41.765
I was in Atlanta, um, but it
was attached to that school.

00:29:41.765 --> 00:29:44.285
And so when I graduated, we
went back to the main campus

00:29:44.345 --> 00:29:45.685
in new Orleans for graduation.

00:29:45.945 --> 00:29:51.275
And while we were there, the entire talk
of the news and the radio and going on was

00:29:51.295 --> 00:29:53.475
the river, the river was at flood stage.

00:29:53.735 --> 00:29:56.515
And so they're having this
constant dialogue about.

00:29:56.929 --> 00:30:00.790
Are they gonna open up the drains and,
uh, keep it from overflowing or are they

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.629
not gonna take a risk and flood the city?

00:30:02.689 --> 00:30:06.070
And so we're less, we're still less
than 10 years from when Katrina

00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:07.429
had happened and all the flooding.

00:30:07.429 --> 00:30:11.830
And so this was the constant
conversation on all the media outlets.

00:30:12.395 --> 00:30:16.334
So on Saturday of that weekend, they
decide they're gonna open the drains.

00:30:16.554 --> 00:30:21.254
And so they go, they take a, a, a crew
out, a video camera out and they're

00:30:21.254 --> 00:30:26.054
filming the actual drains and the side of
these levies as they begin to open them.

00:30:26.475 --> 00:30:27.814
And so we're watching this thing.

00:30:27.814 --> 00:30:30.135
We've been listening for three
days, and so now we're gonna watch.

00:30:30.155 --> 00:30:33.764
And so they begin to open these
giant greats and they start

00:30:33.764 --> 00:30:35.165
opening 'em up in immediately.

00:30:35.455 --> 00:30:37.825
When they started to open them,
there was a little bit of water.

00:30:37.825 --> 00:30:40.264
You could kinda see it,
splashing, uh, kind of thing.

00:30:40.325 --> 00:30:43.225
And then before long they're
wide open and there is water

00:30:43.495 --> 00:30:46.105
just pouring out of these drains.

00:30:46.225 --> 00:30:50.345
I mean, going everywhere, more
water than you could keep up with.

00:30:50.345 --> 00:30:56.270
And within minutes, The entire ground
is gone around the areas where these

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.150
drains are, and that's why they hesitate.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:01.910
And they don't wanna open the drains it's
because it's gonna mess up the crops and

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:03.870
the, the land where this is happening.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:06.990
And so they're opening these drains
up, you know, north of the city, trying

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:10.630
to save the city, but it's gonna mess
up the immediately the land where.

00:31:10.895 --> 00:31:12.895
That land's gonna get flooded
and that's what happened.

00:31:12.895 --> 00:31:15.895
And I mean, within minutes,
there's water Guion everywhere.

00:31:16.115 --> 00:31:18.175
And before long, you
can't even see the ground.

00:31:18.175 --> 00:31:19.095
You just see the water.

00:31:19.435 --> 00:31:20.535
And that's a good picture.

00:31:20.735 --> 00:31:23.455
I think of what God desires
to do with the gospel with us.

00:31:24.195 --> 00:31:28.335
We, we, if our, if our drain, if
our, our gate is shut and it stops

00:31:28.335 --> 00:31:29.535
with me, that's not the goal.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.939
The goal is that it
would come into my life.

00:31:31.939 --> 00:31:35.379
It would change my life and flow
out of my life in everywhere that

00:31:35.379 --> 00:31:36.899
I go, that it would just get on me.

00:31:36.899 --> 00:31:38.580
It would flood the area where I go.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.740
So when I'm at work, the area
is flooded with the gospel.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.260
And when I'm at home, my family
is flooded with the love of Jesus.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.780
And when I coach my son's baseball
team, those eight year olds would

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:52.970
know the love of Jesus because it is
flowing out because I am set to open.

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:54.129
I am not shut.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.260
I am open.

00:31:55.639 --> 00:31:57.939
And when I do that, I am
stewarding the gospel.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:02.100
I am giving away what it
is he has given to me.

00:32:02.399 --> 00:32:05.419
And so if we're gonna be stewards of the
gospel, we've gotta have the right reason.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.820
We've gotta give away
what we have been given.

00:32:07.879 --> 00:32:12.419
And then thirdly, and finally
God desires to speak through you.

00:32:14.189 --> 00:32:15.370
That's a part of his mission.

00:32:16.189 --> 00:32:22.560
He's decided the best way to reach the
world with the gospel is through you.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:25.050
He could have done it any way.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:25.730
He wanted to do it.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:30.610
And he's chosen to use folks like you and
I followers of him, regular old people,

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.290
even ones that haven't been the seminary.

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.970
Can you believe it?

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.620
The message is revolutionary.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.230
And I think it's hard for us
to grasp how of evolutionary.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:52.390
It was in this moment for Gentiles to
be told you can have access to this.

00:32:53.695 --> 00:32:56.935
I think we've probably all experienced
on some levels, some more than others

00:32:57.195 --> 00:32:58.615
of what it feels like to be told.

00:32:59.005 --> 00:33:00.535
Nope, you're not welcome here.

00:33:00.715 --> 00:33:01.655
You're not enough.

00:33:02.375 --> 00:33:04.495
Whatever that thing is, it's not for you.

00:33:05.165 --> 00:33:09.985
This is to the highest degree Gentiles.

00:33:10.195 --> 00:33:12.745
There was a, a sign in
the temple that said.

00:33:13.535 --> 00:33:15.085
Foreigners can come no further.

00:33:15.275 --> 00:33:18.245
This is as far you're not allowed to
actually you can get to the courtyard.

00:33:18.505 --> 00:33:22.485
You're not actually allowed to
go in because you see God resides

00:33:22.485 --> 00:33:24.085
within there and you're not welcome.

00:33:24.425 --> 00:33:29.765
So to the, if degree, it was, you're
not a part of this, this isn't for you.

00:33:30.305 --> 00:33:32.725
Now Paul's coming and saying, guess what?

00:33:32.745 --> 00:33:33.485
The game is changed.

00:33:34.285 --> 00:33:36.395
Jesus said, actually, it's for everybody.

00:33:37.245 --> 00:33:42.024
And so he gets to be the first one
that brings this revolutionary message.

00:33:42.324 --> 00:33:43.665
And there were some parts about it.

00:33:43.665 --> 00:33:45.585
And this is where he is
getting into the mystery.

00:33:45.804 --> 00:33:49.504
He refers to it as the mystery, and
he's gonna reveal the mystery of the

00:33:49.504 --> 00:33:51.665
gospel for these Gentile believers.

00:33:51.845 --> 00:33:55.784
And it was this, he is saying that
they get to be fellow heirs with him.

00:33:55.784 --> 00:33:58.014
They are now a part of the family of God.

00:33:58.014 --> 00:34:02.495
When you choose Jesus, you
are a part of God's family.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:07.550
He said they were gonna be fellow
members of the same body in chapter two.

00:34:08.509 --> 00:34:11.969
In verse 10, it said that when
you receive Jesus, you are a

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:14.090
new creation created for works.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:18.449
They're gonna give evidence that God
is real and that he loves the world and

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:20.969
that he's come to die and save the world.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.610
And so that's why we are
created as a new creation.

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:26.330
But then in cha a little later
in chapter two, he's gonna

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.120
refer to a new race of people.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.639
He came to unify people,
not to divide people.

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:35.120
And so he said, I'm coming to unify.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:38.350
Jew in Gentil as a new race of people.

00:34:38.689 --> 00:34:41.469
I'm not bringing the Gentiles
up to the level of the Jews.

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:42.709
Who've already got it all figured out.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:47.189
No I'm elevating, 'em both up into
something completely new, the same,

00:34:47.609 --> 00:34:51.949
the same race, the same type of people,
the same new creation along the way.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:55.830
And so when the Gentiles, when
they receive Jesus, when someone

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.580
see Jesus, they are a fellow
member of the body of Christ.

00:34:59.799 --> 00:35:03.980
And then he also says you're a partaker
in the promise promises of Christ.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.339
Jesus.

00:35:05.035 --> 00:35:11.935
Now to partake is to join in is to eat
or drink, to, to, to consume whatever it

00:35:11.935 --> 00:35:14.214
is that's going along, um, at that time.

00:35:14.214 --> 00:35:16.055
And so look, you get to be a part of it.

00:35:16.055 --> 00:35:19.015
There's all these promises and these
covenants that God had made all

00:35:19.015 --> 00:35:20.375
the way back in the old Testament.

00:35:20.755 --> 00:35:22.255
And now you are a part of that.

00:35:22.555 --> 00:35:23.935
It is for you.

00:35:24.315 --> 00:35:29.005
It includes you get to
participate and partake in that.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.510
Over in second IANS chapter two,
verse 14, he would say it this way.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:37.550
Paul said to this, he called you
through the gospel so that you

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:39.230
may attain glory of our Lord.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.150
Jesus Christ.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.230
There are good things found
in the body of Christ.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.150
There are good things that come
when we give our life to Jesus.

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:52.420
And he's saying it's revolutionary
message because he's saying

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:54.060
it's now available to everybody.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.610
There's no one who's excluded.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.210
It's available.

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.890
Everybody gets the opportunity.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.220
To receive it.

00:36:00.759 --> 00:36:04.540
And so the truth is for us in
this place, we are stewards of

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:07.100
this same revolutionary message.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:16.140
We are given the opportunity to
share and to speak this same message.

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:17.540
It's our goal.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:18.700
It's our role.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:20.020
It's what we're supposed to do.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.970
Now.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.009
This isn't the way it works, but assume.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:29.900
that for someone to receive Jesus, they
had to interact with the gospel 26 times

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.380
in various ways, assuming that it took
26 interactions with the gospel, for

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.740
someone to give their life to Jesus.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.620
And so to kind of give us a picture
that imagine that I strung a line.

00:36:40.075 --> 00:36:42.725
From like a close line from
this wall to this wall.

00:36:42.745 --> 00:36:47.085
And along that wall, put 26 cards
up there, uh, lettered a through Z

00:36:47.105 --> 00:36:49.205
to represent those 26 interactions.

00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:53.325
And somebody has to have 26
interactions with the gospel before

00:36:53.325 --> 00:36:54.845
they would become a Christian.

00:36:55.145 --> 00:36:59.485
And then if I were to ask you, which one
of those is the most important step, most

00:36:59.485 --> 00:37:02.475
of the time intuitive, we would think
the one where they become a Christian.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.379
So the last one from Y to Z, but
the truth is that every single

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.020
one of those steps are important.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:14.180
If it took 26 interactions with
the gospel, then all 26 matter.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.939
Now, what does that mean for you?

00:37:15.939 --> 00:37:19.580
Because sometimes when we share the
gospel and we share our faith and we ask

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:24.095
somebody, if they wanna receive Jesus,
they say, no,  and I walk away from that

00:37:24.095 --> 00:37:27.734
interaction feeling defeated and feeling
like maybe I don't ever wanna do that

00:37:27.734 --> 00:37:31.975
again, because that was rejection and
rejection hurts and rejection stinks.

00:37:32.194 --> 00:37:33.254
And I don't want that again.

00:37:33.254 --> 00:37:36.095
So I'm not even gonna put myself
out there because if I do it

00:37:36.095 --> 00:37:37.375
again, they may say no again.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:42.410
Well guess what, if they're walking
along those 26 interactions, they've

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.810
just had another interaction with Jesus.

00:37:44.279 --> 00:37:47.250
They it's your job to have
interactions with people.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.850
It's God's job to save people.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:53.770
And when I get that outta whack,
I stop doing the exact thing

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:56.250
he's asking me to do, because
I'm trying to do what I can't do.

00:37:56.875 --> 00:37:58.154
I wanna see people saved.

00:37:58.154 --> 00:38:01.435
And so the moment I share salvation
with 'em share the gospel with

00:38:01.515 --> 00:38:02.194
'em, they don't receive it.

00:38:02.194 --> 00:38:04.435
Then I don't, I don't do it
anymore because they rejected me.

00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:07.515
And so being able to remember
that it's not my job.

00:38:07.915 --> 00:38:09.915
I wanna release you from
the weight of that today.

00:38:09.935 --> 00:38:13.315
If nothing else happens, just
be reminded that only God can

00:38:13.315 --> 00:38:15.555
save people, but he's choose.

00:38:15.694 --> 00:38:16.275
He has chosen.

00:38:16.375 --> 00:38:20.865
And he chew uses every single day to
communicate that message through you.

00:38:23.165 --> 00:38:24.505
So to be stewards of the gospel.

00:38:25.125 --> 00:38:29.155
We've gotta recognize that he
wants to speak through me, that

00:38:29.155 --> 00:38:33.795
your voice is important that your
voice, your life, it is noteworthy.

00:38:35.945 --> 00:38:39.115
It's your life is such a big
deal that Jesus died for you.

00:38:41.495 --> 00:38:45.085
You, because he wants to
do something through you.

00:38:45.105 --> 00:38:48.675
He wants to have relationship with
you that makes your life note earthy.

00:38:48.945 --> 00:38:51.075
When somebody's willing to
lay down their life for you.

00:38:51.075 --> 00:38:52.355
That means you're valuable for.

00:38:53.009 --> 00:38:58.029
So be encouraged in this place today that
God loves you very much, be challenged

00:38:58.029 --> 00:39:01.669
in this place today, realizing that
God doesn't want it to stop with you.

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:05.029
If you are one of those that have received
Jesus, and you're a Christ follower,

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.549
it's not supposed to stop with you.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.790
It's supposed to continue, is
supposed to flow through you.

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:12.669
And so our question today that
we're gonna finish with is this,

00:39:13.569 --> 00:39:15.779
what are you doing with the gospel?

00:39:16.825 --> 00:39:20.905
Because we are all stewards of
the gospel, even if I never choose

00:39:21.265 --> 00:39:25.105
salvation, I am stewarding the gospel
and that's how I'm stewarding it.

00:39:25.165 --> 00:39:27.185
I'm deciding I'm not
gonna do anything with it.

00:39:27.505 --> 00:39:28.185
I don't want it.

00:39:28.645 --> 00:39:29.545
I'm gonna say no.

00:39:30.475 --> 00:39:35.575
So each and every person gets to
steward the gospel and it starts there.

00:39:35.955 --> 00:39:40.045
If I receive the of salvation,
then it's about what am I doing

00:39:40.065 --> 00:39:41.085
to share it with other people?

00:39:42.565 --> 00:39:45.385
, but we've all been given the
gift it's available to all of us.

00:39:45.385 --> 00:39:48.345
He didn't randomly pick people
out of a phone book and say,

00:39:48.365 --> 00:39:49.745
you get the chance at salvation.

00:39:50.245 --> 00:39:50.745
Not at all.

00:39:50.745 --> 00:39:53.305
He died for each and every
person who's ever lived.

00:39:55.645 --> 00:39:56.385
So it's available.

00:39:56.865 --> 00:39:58.545
I get to decide what I'm gonna do with it.

00:39:58.545 --> 00:40:01.105
I get to decide how I'm
going to respond to it.

00:40:01.655 --> 00:40:06.255
Paul understood that as a follower
of Jesus, it should affect each

00:40:06.255 --> 00:40:07.615
and every aspect of his life.

00:40:08.035 --> 00:40:10.495
And that's how he chose
to steward the gospel.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:13.710
For the believers in this room,
you've been given the same

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:16.120
responsibility to pass that along.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.899
And for those in the room that have
may never had that time yet, or they've

00:40:20.899 --> 00:40:24.339
given their, their life to Jesus,
they haven't received the gift yet.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.339
That's your next step?

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.339
And that's what I've been praying for
all week long is that this would be the

00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:30.660
moment today where you say, you know what?

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:32.970
This is the time when I see the gift.

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:37.649
A gift is great to be given a
gift to be given an inheritance.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.290
It's wonderful.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.850
But it matters more
about what I do with it.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.010
Right.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:44.370
I can bring you a gift.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:46.090
It can be wrapped up and look great.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:49.090
And if you never open the
gift, it does you absolutely.

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.450
No.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:49.650
Good.

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:53.390
And so I would encourage
you today in this place.

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:56.310
If you're a person that says, you
know what, I know a lot about God, I.

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:57.860
I know about salvation.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.300
I know the whole thing I've been in
church my whole life, but I, I don't know

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.940
that I've ever actually opened the gift.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.940
I would encourage you to do that today.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.700
That's the best thing you could do to
steward the gospel today would be to open

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.020
the gift and receive him in this place.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.260
So friends, what are we
gonna do with the gospel?

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:16.380
Let's pray.

00:41:22.595 --> 00:41:24.254
God, you are a good God.

00:41:24.634 --> 00:41:28.575
And we have spent time PR praising
you and singing about that.

00:41:30.634 --> 00:41:34.095
And so I just wanna reiterate that
in this place, we praise you because

00:41:34.095 --> 00:41:36.015
you did what none of us could do.

00:41:36.015 --> 00:41:41.095
And you paid a price that none of us,
um, could pay and still have life.

00:41:41.115 --> 00:41:44.125
And so father, I thank you that
you've done what is necessary for

00:41:44.125 --> 00:41:45.564
us to be able to have salvation.

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:47.790
I'm grateful for the gospel.

00:41:48.049 --> 00:41:51.230
I'm grateful for people all throughout
history who have communicated that

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.430
it hasn't just stayed with them.

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:53.910
They've passed it on today.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:56.150
We looked at a letter from
apostle Paul, where he did that.

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.270
He dedicated his life, but
there have been a lot of others.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.350
I've got relatives who
didn't keep it to themselves.

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:03.350
They shared it with me along the way.

00:42:04.405 --> 00:42:07.145
And so father, we just wanna take a
moment right now and say, thank you

00:42:07.145 --> 00:42:08.745
for working in the lives of people.

00:42:09.195 --> 00:42:11.305
Thank you for doing a
work that only you can do.

00:42:11.305 --> 00:42:14.665
Thank you for including us in the work
you didn't have to, but as Paul would

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:16.385
say, it's a privilege to be a part.

00:42:16.975 --> 00:42:18.985
It's a privilege to have a role to play.

00:42:19.925 --> 00:42:23.505
So father, I pray right now, and this time
that holy spirit would have the freedom

00:42:24.195 --> 00:42:30.215
to speak to us in our heart and in our
soul to point out what our next step is.

00:42:33.255 --> 00:42:38.745
Some of us need to, uh, be rebuked
a little bit because we're not

00:42:38.745 --> 00:42:42.625
stewarding the gospel the way that you
would want us to, and you need to be

00:42:42.625 --> 00:42:43.905
able to point that out in our life.

00:42:43.905 --> 00:42:45.505
And we need to be able to receive that.

00:42:47.215 --> 00:42:52.955
Repent of that and move forward
and be better and do what it

00:42:52.955 --> 00:42:54.195
is, what you're asking us to do.

00:42:55.785 --> 00:42:58.955
Some of us in this place today need
to be reminded and that we matter

00:43:00.175 --> 00:43:01.634
and that our testimony matters.

00:43:03.335 --> 00:43:06.665
Now what we have to say matters,
not because of who we are, but of

00:43:06.665 --> 00:43:08.425
who you are residing within us.

00:43:09.285 --> 00:43:12.145
And by your authority, we
have the opportunity to share

00:43:12.395 --> 00:43:13.985
meaningful information with people.

00:43:15.315 --> 00:43:18.655
So father, I pray that you would love on
those people in this place, that you would

00:43:18.655 --> 00:43:23.215
encourage them and you would embolden
them and you would empower them to walk

00:43:23.235 --> 00:43:29.775
out of this room in a whole new sense of
self and a whole new sense of courage of

00:43:29.775 --> 00:43:34.255
realizing that they're not alone, that
you are with them stride, right beside

00:43:34.255 --> 00:43:37.205
them seeking and desiring to lead the way.

00:43:40.215 --> 00:43:41.435
And then there's others in the room.

00:43:41.435 --> 00:43:42.875
Father have never received you.

00:43:42.875 --> 00:43:44.875
They've never opened
the gift of salvation.

00:43:45.545 --> 00:43:47.835
They may have heard it for the
first time today, or maybe they've

00:43:47.835 --> 00:43:49.235
heard it for the hundred 50th time.

00:43:50.265 --> 00:43:51.475
They weren't quite ready.

00:43:51.705 --> 00:43:52.955
They had more questions.

00:43:52.955 --> 00:43:53.755
They had more things.

00:43:53.755 --> 00:43:56.515
Well, father, I, I believe
today's the day that you desire

00:43:56.515 --> 00:43:57.515
for them to come to know you.

00:43:58.975 --> 00:44:00.505
And so that is you in this place.

00:44:00.625 --> 00:44:03.185
I would encourage you
to nail that down today.

00:44:03.185 --> 00:44:06.384
There is no better stewarding of
the gospel that you can do than to

00:44:06.384 --> 00:44:07.705
know for sure that you are saved.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.480
It all flows out of that.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.520
You can't be a good steward and
until you've received the gift

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.480
and received, uh, the blessing.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:20.720
And so if that is you, during this time of
invitation, you can come up front, you can

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.960
talk to me, you can talk to pastor Ben.

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:26.840
We'd love to help, you know,
uh, the ins and outs and just

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.080
the, you know, to pray with.

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:31.150
But ultimately it's just about
you believing you don't have

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:32.110
to come up here to do that.

00:44:33.355 --> 00:44:35.055
You don't have to sign a card to do that.

00:44:35.515 --> 00:44:39.295
Romans ten nine says that it, for
those that believe in the conf in

00:44:39.295 --> 00:44:41.615
their heart and confess with their
mouth, that they shall be saved.

00:44:41.615 --> 00:44:42.615
And so that's what it's about.

00:44:43.235 --> 00:44:47.015
And I could not encourage
you more to do it today,

00:44:50.555 --> 00:44:53.685
father, I pray right now in this time
of in, and you'd have the freedom

00:44:53.745 --> 00:44:57.885
to do what only you can do to change
the lives of people individually,

00:44:57.885 --> 00:45:00.685
but to change this community, to
change the city of Cincinnati and

00:45:00.685 --> 00:45:02.005
ultimately to change state of Ohio.

00:45:04.135 --> 00:45:05.235
You're doing it through people.

00:45:05.695 --> 00:45:06.475
You always have.

00:45:06.495 --> 00:45:07.275
You always, will.

00:45:07.735 --> 00:45:08.795
We wanna be a part of that.

00:45:09.965 --> 00:45:12.675
Thank you for allowing us to be
a part of your family, your name.

00:45:12.715 --> 00:45:13.035
I pray.

00:45:13.305 --> 00:45:13.595
Amen.
