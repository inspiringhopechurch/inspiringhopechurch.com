00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.610
Recently moved there after the residency.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.160
Uh, the beginning of the work
there, uh, to plant a church

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.840
called bridge bridge city church.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.600
Um, and so I'm excited for
you to hear from him today.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.910
Um, if you're wondering, why
is he sharing number one?

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.250
Because I love him and I'm
thankful to be able to hear from.

00:00:16.865 --> 00:00:19.384
Number two, it was dealing with
some sickness early this week.

00:00:19.384 --> 00:00:22.534
We had some mission teams in, I had no
clue if I was going to have a voice today.

00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:26.525
And so in because of that,
we know how the Lord works.

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:30.395
Um, I was able to ask Jonathan
to come in and preach today.

00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:31.685
So I'm so thankful for him to come.

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:33.035
So I'm going to have him come up here.

00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:34.385
I'm going to pray for him.

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:36.125
And then he's going to
have a word to share with.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.610
So let's take a moment
to pray, Lord Jesus.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.640
We are so thankful Lord for you, Lord.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.560
We're so thankful for this time
to hear from Jonathan in the word.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.540
Uh, Lord, I pray that
you speak through him.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.110
Use him mightily Lord, because
we know Lord, you have a word for

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.730
each one of us Lord, including me.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.200
And I'm praying that my heart is open.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.320
I'm praying that all of our hearts are
open Lord to your word and your truth,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.060
and that we will lead out here change.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.430
And so Lord, we praise
you and we thank you.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.970
And we pray this in your.

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:02.045
Amen.

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:02.525
Amen.

00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:03.365
Amen.

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:05.165
Well, no, it's good to be
with you in this place.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.015
We're going to be in the book
of Ephesians chapter three.

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:14.045
And as you turn over there, I'm going
to start with a mouthful and tell you

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:18.425
about a guy named Luis Carlos  de Camara.

00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:21.185
I'm not doing it in one time.

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:21.665
That was it.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:22.505
That's all you get.

00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:28.405
Um, he was a Portuguese aristocrat
who died suddenly at the age of 40.

00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:31.845
Years old when he died, he was a bachelor.

00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:32.595
He was unmarried.

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:35.745
He did not have any children, nor
did he have any living relatives.

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:37.425
So you think, okay, so he's died.

00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:41.685
So anything that he owns, uh, that
remains all his possession, as things are

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:45.825
going to be absorbed by the government
where you would be wrong because you

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:49.845
see, he had, he had claimed some folks
to receive his inheritance, even though

00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:54.255
he didn't have the normal, uh, family
members in place that maybe you would

00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:56.625
pass those things along to 12 years.

00:01:57.795 --> 00:01:58.575
To his death.

00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:04.905
He picks out 70 people to
receive pieces of his estate if

00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:07.245
he were, and when he would die.

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:09.375
Now, how did he come up
with these 70 people?

00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:12.345
One day he brought a couple of
folks over to serve as witnesses.

00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:16.335
He opened up a phone book and he
began to randomly select names.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.990
Out of the phone book and is these 70
people that 12 years later when he passed

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.030
away received portions of his estate.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.830
So he had a 12 room apartment that
was passed out among these folks.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.720
He had a house in Northern Portugal
that someone received, he had a car

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.940
and he had 25,000 euros in the bank.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.900
And this was his inheritance
that he had passed on to these

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900
70 random folks along the way.

00:02:45.405 --> 00:02:48.435
So when it inheritance can be a
good thing and it can be a good

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:49.695
thing for receiving inheritance.

00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:55.995
But what I do with the inheritance
is just as important, if not more

00:02:55.995 --> 00:02:59.114
important than the fact that I
received an inheritance in the first

00:02:59.114 --> 00:03:01.755
place, it's great to receive things.

00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:07.785
It's great to have resources, but what
I do with it, how I steward that along

00:03:07.785 --> 00:03:11.894
the way matters just as much, if not
more than the fact that I received.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.590
In the first place.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.120
I'll give you an example.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.760
Another mouthful here,
Huntington Hartford.

00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:20.745
The second Huntington Hartford.

00:03:20.924 --> 00:03:25.875
The second, if you can't tell this guy,
he grew up wealthy, his it's in his name.

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:27.015
He grew up with money.

00:03:27.195 --> 00:03:31.095
So when his dad passed away, he
was 11 years old and his dad left

00:03:31.095 --> 00:03:34.515
him $90 million as an inheritance.

00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:37.085
So he grows up, he goes to school.

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:41.615
He is well educated, but he's not
so savvy when it comes to business.

00:03:41.765 --> 00:03:44.645
So along the way, he had some
business opportunities and projects

00:03:44.645 --> 00:03:48.485
and passion projects that he gave
his self to his time to, and his

00:03:48.485 --> 00:03:50.735
money to, and they did not pan out.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.260
For example, he had a real
estate deal in The Bahamas.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.179
He sunk $30 million into that and got
nothing out of it lost all 30 million.

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.310
He wanted to start a modeling agency.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.790
And so he started that and it ended up
falling through and it wasn't very good.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.810
And so by 1992, he filed bankruptcy
and was forced to move out of.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.440
Uh, swanky living quarters and into a kind
of a broken down apartment along the way.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.450
And so an inheritance is great.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.579
Resources are great.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.380
What we do with them matter
just as much as the fact that I

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.600
received them in the first place.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.190
And that is stewardship.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.580
Stewardship is how I handle the
things that have been given.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.050
In that replies to all aspects of
life, not just financial things, but

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.710
with my time and with my gifts and
with the family that have been born

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.620
into the job, all these different
things, these different aspects of life

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.090
are affected by how I steward them.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.510
And so today in this place, we're
going to look at the good news of the

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.570
gospel through the lens of stewards.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.200
How I handle the things
that have been given to me.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.650
And so the title for today's
message is stewards of mystery.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.039
Now we're going to talk about this a
little more here in a minute, but in this

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.570
passage, the apostle Paul is going to talk
about mystery as being the gospel, though.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.490
You can't understand
all of it and editors.

00:05:12.984 --> 00:05:16.525
Faith aspect to it and that the
blessings and the benefit of it

00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:18.025
are beyond our comprehension.

00:05:18.025 --> 00:05:21.594
And so there's just some mystery about
the gospel about why would God would

00:05:21.594 --> 00:05:24.565
do it in the first place and how it
worked in all these different things.

00:05:24.565 --> 00:05:28.645
And so interchangeably, we're going
to use the words gospel in mystery,

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:30.445
uh, throughout this time today.

00:05:30.445 --> 00:05:33.685
And so let's read together six
verses in Ephesians chapter.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.280
And then we'll talk about three
different truths that we see from

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.360
the passage of that will help
us be stewards of the mystery.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.620
So let's read together Ephesians
chapter three, starting in verse one.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.590
Paul says for this reason I Paul, a
prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.219
of the Gentiles, assuming that you
have heard of the stewardship of

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:57.200
God's grace, that was given to me.

00:05:58.635 --> 00:06:02.594
How the mystery was made
known to me by revelation.

00:06:02.955 --> 00:06:07.965
As I have written briefly, when you
read this, you can perceive my insight

00:06:07.965 --> 00:06:12.825
into the mystery of Christ, which was
not made known to the sons of men in

00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:17.445
other generations, as it has now been
revealed to his holy apostles and the

00:06:17.445 --> 00:06:23.265
prophets by the spirit verse six, this
mystery is the Gentiles are fellow.

00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:27.995
Members of the same body and
partakers of the promise.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.890
In Christ Jesus through the gospel.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.870
So Paul he's writing a letter to
a group of believers in Ephesus.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.840
They are Gentile believers,
which means they are not Jewish.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.790
They're like a lot of us in this room.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.350
We're not Jewish, we Gentile.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.550
And so he's writing to a group of people
who for a long time, had not been allowed

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.780
to even have salvation, to have access,
to go into the temple along the way.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.180
And so he's going to write, and he's
saying, look, you have been, now

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.040
you're the recipients of this mystery.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.510
Grace of this salvation is now available
to you in a time when I wasn't before.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.400
And so he's going to break it
down and he says, look, you've got

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.140
to be a steward of the mystery.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.550
And so let's talk today, three
truths about stewarding the mystery

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.670
and stewarding the gospel, because
if it has been given to us, then

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.460
we have to do something with it.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.250
So the first truth is the seed
in this passage is this that

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.390
we've got to have the right.

00:07:20.415 --> 00:07:22.125
We've got to have the right reason.

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:26.655
If I'm going to appropriately and do
a good job of stewarding the gospel,

00:07:26.865 --> 00:07:28.485
then I've got to have the right reason.

00:07:28.485 --> 00:07:31.785
My motivation has got to be correct.

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:32.865
Paul start here.

00:07:32.865 --> 00:07:35.025
He's talking about the
privilege of proclamation.

00:07:35.085 --> 00:07:36.585
He starts in the very first verse.

00:07:36.585 --> 00:07:37.905
He said, for this reason I.

00:07:39.495 --> 00:07:43.605
I'm telling you this and he say, look,
it's a joy and a privilege to be able to

00:07:43.605 --> 00:07:47.805
share this there, regardless of where I
find myself in life, I am going to have

00:07:47.805 --> 00:07:50.775
joy in it because it Springs from God.

00:07:50.775 --> 00:07:55.275
We see this in the very first word he
says, for this reason he's referring to

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:58.155
the work that Jesus did on the cross.

00:07:58.185 --> 00:08:01.935
He's referring to what Jesus
did by offering salvation.

00:08:01.935 --> 00:08:04.485
And so basically he's saying everything.

00:08:05.424 --> 00:08:08.755
Stems from and flows out of
the fact of what Jesus did.

00:08:09.234 --> 00:08:14.784
It's all because of him, it's a privilege
to do what I do because of Jesus and

00:08:14.784 --> 00:08:19.554
because of what Jesus did, I can now
do what it is he has called me to do.

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:23.755
And so Paul's, apostleship his
office is his leadership, his

00:08:23.755 --> 00:08:28.885
role that God had given him, it
determined all aspects of his life.

00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:31.385
It influenced his relationships.

00:08:31.505 --> 00:08:34.804
It influenced the, where he
w how he worked and where

00:08:34.804 --> 00:08:36.335
he worked and what he did.

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:40.655
And throughout his letters, we
see his understanding of this.

00:08:40.715 --> 00:08:43.385
There was a phrase that he would
use that would come up at over and

00:08:43.385 --> 00:08:48.305
over again, that Konig showed, uh,
I am, who am I said, I am, I'm doing

00:08:48.305 --> 00:08:49.715
what I've said I was going to do.

00:08:49.715 --> 00:08:53.694
And so he would say, I Paul and there
were different times and that was

00:08:53.694 --> 00:08:57.444
always kind of his way to help them
remember who it was, who was speaking

00:08:57.655 --> 00:08:59.155
and what had happened along the way.

00:08:59.155 --> 00:09:02.005
And then he speaking with the
authority is being called by God

00:09:02.185 --> 00:09:04.104
to give this message to the people.

00:09:04.104 --> 00:09:06.564
And so just give you a couple
of examples of what that

00:09:06.564 --> 00:09:08.635
looked like in play right here.

00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:13.915
So in second Corinthians chapter
10, verse one, he says, I, Paul

00:09:14.005 --> 00:09:18.444
myself in treat you by the meekness
and the gentleness of Christ.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.449
Over in Galatians five, verse two,
he says, look, I Paul, say to you

00:09:24.449 --> 00:09:29.340
that if you accept circumcision,
Christ will be no advantage to you.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.790
A third example, Colossians 1 23.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.920
He says, if indeed, you continue
in faith, stable and steadfast, not

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.790
shifting from the hope of the gospel
that you heard, which has been proclaimed

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:47.160
in all creation under heaven and
of which I, Paul became a minister.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.280
And he says it in our
verse one right here.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.830
He said for this reason I, Paul.

00:09:54.245 --> 00:09:54.995
All the time.

00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:59.885
He was always reminding them of who he
was not for his glory, because he believed

00:09:59.885 --> 00:10:05.074
everything he was doing was being sent out
by God that God had given him this role.

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:06.545
God had given him this message.

00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:09.185
And so he's all the time
pointing back saying it's.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.800
Paul, you know, the guy that
God's given this message to.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.160
And so that's the authority
that I'm speaking in for him.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.550
He wasn't saying it's in my authority
by saying I, Paul he's pointing

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.130
back to Jesus in Jesus' authority.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.850
And so Paul viewed his life through
the lens of apostleship, which

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.190
was an extension of salvation.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.000
You see, he had an encounter with Jesus on
the Damascus road that changed his life.

00:10:32.515 --> 00:10:33.865
It changed his life spiritually.

00:10:33.865 --> 00:10:35.215
It changed his life physically.

00:10:35.215 --> 00:10:37.165
It changed his life geographically.

00:10:37.165 --> 00:10:40.555
And for the rest of his life,
he changed what he was about.

00:10:40.555 --> 00:10:44.425
He was walking one path and then
Jesus got ahold of his life and he

00:10:44.425 --> 00:10:45.895
put him on a completely new path.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:48.115
And we'll talk a little
more, more about that.

00:10:48.265 --> 00:10:51.865
But from that point forward, it
was all about the gospel and it

00:10:51.865 --> 00:10:54.495
was all about the mystery here.

00:10:54.505 --> 00:10:58.255
And then it being a steward
of that along the way.

00:10:58.555 --> 00:11:00.625
And so everything that he did.

00:11:01.875 --> 00:11:03.885
Float out of salvation.

00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:08.655
Jesus filled up every crevice of his
life to the point where it a little bit

00:11:08.655 --> 00:11:13.185
later in chapter three in verse 13, he's
going to be able to say so I ask you not

00:11:13.185 --> 00:11:18.435
to lose heart over what I am suffering
for you, which is for your glory.

00:11:18.585 --> 00:11:21.165
So what's he suffering when
he's writing this letter?

00:11:21.165 --> 00:11:21.735
He is in.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.040
He is currently at the, at the time
that he's pinning this letter to these

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.500
folks in emphasis, he is in prison.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.339
He is in chains.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:29.760
Why?

00:11:29.819 --> 00:11:33.150
Because he's preaching this
message of the gospel because he's

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.939
stewarding the message of the gospel.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.510
And there's folks that don't like the
idea that Gentiles are, can now have

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:43.290
salvation there's folks that are saying,
no, that's not the way we've been told.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.079
That's not what we've understood
it to be for all of these years.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.110
You're introducing something
new and we don't like that.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.030
We're going to have you arrested.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:55.439
And so he is currently in chains as he's
raised in prison, writing this letter,

00:11:55.439 --> 00:12:00.780
and he's able to say it is for God's glory
and I am a prisoner in Christ and it's.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:06.120
He able to find a way to be content
in the middle of this because Paul

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:12.930
understood that to be in Christ was more
important than his outward circumstances.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:13.350
Right.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.890
And he says, and he says,
I am a prisoner for Christ.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.300
So he's suffering.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.270
And in verse 13, he's saying it's
okay, because it's for your glory

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.270
is for your benefit because you're
going to get to know about the

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.430
glorious message of salvation.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.210
And if it requires me to be in
prison for that to happen, then it's.

00:12:31.145 --> 00:12:32.105
It's okay.

00:12:32.255 --> 00:12:37.145
And so the same thing is true for
us to be in Christ, wherever it is,

00:12:37.145 --> 00:12:41.735
he has us is better than whatever
the outward circumstances that are

00:12:41.735 --> 00:12:45.035
going on in my life at that time.

00:12:45.275 --> 00:12:51.305
And having the right reason allows us
to accept our situation so that we can

00:12:51.305 --> 00:12:56.645
focus on what it is God wants to do
with us in the middle of that situation.

00:12:56.705 --> 00:12:57.755
It allows us to be.

00:12:58.935 --> 00:13:04.425
It helps us focus on not on what distracts
us from what God desires to do in us,

00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:06.645
but to focus on what he wants us through.

00:13:06.645 --> 00:13:10.035
In so many times, it's easy to get
distracted about things that are going on,

00:13:10.035 --> 00:13:14.265
especially when circumstances aren't ideal
when things aren't the way we would wish

00:13:14.265 --> 00:13:18.225
for them to be, or the way that we would
hope for them to be in life is hard and

00:13:18.225 --> 00:13:20.715
it stinks and is painful along the way.

00:13:20.715 --> 00:13:22.175
And we're in situations
that we don't want.

00:13:22.194 --> 00:13:24.135
It's easy to be distracted.

00:13:24.915 --> 00:13:27.585
Do you know anybody that
has a hard time on Monday?

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.660
You find people that have
just a hard time on Mondays.

00:13:30.839 --> 00:13:33.510
I used to work with a
lady, the bless her heart.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.910
She just struggled on Mondays.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.959
She began struggling about
Monday on Saturday night, like

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.819
it was coming around the bin.

00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:44.310
And so everything was about Monday.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.530
And if it was negative, it
was cause it was a Monday.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.750
And if something really good happened,
I was like, well, I can't believe

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.550
that actually happened on a Monday.

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:55.050
And it was all the time and it
influenced her entire attitude.

00:13:55.349 --> 00:13:56.550
And so like, she always got.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:57.870
On Monday.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.430
And she was like, well, it's a Monday.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.180
What are you expecting?

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.910
It's like, it's just like any other
day, like, come on, let's go to work.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.160
And it was just always so negative.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.390
And I, of course that happened.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.050
It's a Monday.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.070
And you know what scripture would
say, Psalm 1 18 24 says, this is

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.540
the day that the Lord has made.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.760
I should rejoice and be glad in it.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:20.160
God made Mondays, Mondays are great days,
but for her it had become a distraction.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.480
Nothing good was going to happen
on a Monday, nothing beneficial,

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.510
nothing kingdom minded,
kingdom oriented could happen.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.460
God doesn't work on Mondays.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.480
He takes Monday off.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.890
That's why everything's bad's happening.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:32.160
Right?

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.170
So when we have the right reason,
we stay focused in on what

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.970
it is that God desires to do.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.890
Even on a Monday, even in the
midst of hard circumstances.

00:14:44.745 --> 00:14:48.945
Because having the right reason, it
allows me to operate in my current

00:14:48.945 --> 00:14:53.865
situation to the best of my ability,
which opens the door for God to

00:14:53.865 --> 00:14:56.445
work to the best of his ability.

00:14:57.705 --> 00:15:03.405
I'm going to say that again, having the
right reason allows me to operate in

00:15:03.405 --> 00:15:07.995
my current circumstance to the best of
my ability, which opens the door for

00:15:07.995 --> 00:15:10.425
God to work to the best of his ability.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.980
A good example of this is in
the old Testament, the book of

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.010
Daniel with three guys named
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:20.670
They had been taken captive and
been taken to another country.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.880
But while they're there, they're
experiencing the favor of God to the

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.840
point where the king really enjoys
them and has them around in his court.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.450
And he kind of dotes on them
and he likes them along the way.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.730
So the locals don't like that.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.110
And so they're out to get him.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.470
And so they.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:39.520
They set a trap to get them either
thrown in prison or to be killed because

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.910
they don't like the fact that these
foreigners have come in and their own

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.610
king likes them more than they like them.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.390
He likes them.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.860
And so the trap was this.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.439
They said they knew how
faithful they were to follow.

00:15:50.994 --> 00:15:51.564
God.

00:15:51.714 --> 00:15:55.285
And so they said, we're going to make
it a rule and a law that everyone's

00:15:55.285 --> 00:15:57.084
got to bow down and worship the king.

00:15:57.084 --> 00:15:58.494
And so the king says, that sounds good.

00:15:58.494 --> 00:15:59.395
Let's do that.

00:15:59.604 --> 00:16:03.474
So they put this law into place
and these three guys refused to do

00:16:03.474 --> 00:16:05.694
that to the best of their ability.

00:16:05.875 --> 00:16:08.844
They were being obedient to
what God had given him to do

00:16:08.844 --> 00:16:10.435
regardless of the circumstance.

00:16:10.645 --> 00:16:11.305
So there are.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.190
And they're going to be thrown into a fire
and they're going to be in this big, giant

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.480
furnace and they're going to be killed.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.730
And that's going to be the
consequences for their, uh, their

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.760
actions of being obedient to God.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.110
And so to the best of their ability,
they go to the furnace, doing exactly

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.850
what it is God had called them to do.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.650
They find themselves at the brink of
death, but because they had done exactly

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:36.180
what God had called them to do it cleared
out space for God to do what only, he.

00:16:37.245 --> 00:16:39.405
So it says that they get
thrown into the furnace.

00:16:39.854 --> 00:16:42.834
And then we pick up the story in
Daniel chapter three, verse 24

00:16:42.854 --> 00:16:45.285
king Nebuchadnezzar was astonished.

00:16:45.405 --> 00:16:46.755
He rose up in haste.

00:16:46.875 --> 00:16:48.765
He declared to his counselors.

00:16:49.005 --> 00:16:53.354
Did we not cast three
men bound into the fire?

00:16:54.045 --> 00:16:56.194
And they answered and said
to the king, it's true.

00:16:56.204 --> 00:16:56.745
Oh, king.

00:16:56.984 --> 00:17:03.255
He answered and said, but I see four men
Unbound walking in the midst of the fire.

00:17:04.185 --> 00:17:08.385
And they are not hurt in the appearance
of the fourth is like the son of the guy.

00:17:09.435 --> 00:17:15.795
When we steward what God has given us
with the right reason, then we don't

00:17:15.795 --> 00:17:18.225
be distracted by the circumstances.

00:17:18.225 --> 00:17:20.175
We don't become discontented.

00:17:20.325 --> 00:17:23.505
We are all in and what he's
given us to do, because what

00:17:23.505 --> 00:17:25.005
he has given you to do today.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.670
Is an extension of his gift of salvation.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.430
If he is, if he has saved you
and you've received the gift of

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.110
salvation, then he has a role for you.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.390
And he has a desire and
a plan for your life.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.250
And so when we walk that path, even
when circumstances are hard, it sets the

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.580
stage for him to do what only he can do.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:47.909
It says that the fire in this
furnace that they cranked it

00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:49.350
up even hotter than normal.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.379
To the point, it was like six times
higher to the point that when the

00:17:52.379 --> 00:17:55.980
guards who came in through these
three guys into the fire, the guards

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.080
were consumed and died by the fire.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.060
That's how hot it was.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.940
So not only did they not die, says
when they pulled them out, their

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.310
clothes were not singed and they
didn't even smell like smoke.

00:18:06.165 --> 00:18:08.024
God didn't work that only he could do.

00:18:08.024 --> 00:18:12.165
And he was able to do that because these
three guys did exactly what they could do.

00:18:12.314 --> 00:18:16.034
They could be obedient even to
the point of dying in a furnace.

00:18:16.034 --> 00:18:18.764
And so when they walked that
path, God showed up and did

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:21.344
a work that only he can do.

00:18:22.064 --> 00:18:25.485
And so Paul, in this letter, he's
talking about the example of stewardship

00:18:25.485 --> 00:18:28.784
and living a life that's based
upon what Christ has done for us.

00:18:29.114 --> 00:18:31.425
And we should see it as
a challenge to examine.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.719
Our level of stewardship.

00:18:34.139 --> 00:18:36.120
So why did I get up this morning?

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.310
What's my agenda for today.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.620
What's my motivation for today.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.500
Why am I moving around
and doing stuff today?

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.750
What am I trying to get out of today?

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.679
What are, what is it?

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:49.590
That's motivating my actions
because Paul was saying it's

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.120
all tied to what God has done.

00:18:52.425 --> 00:18:55.875
Everything that I do every moment
of every day is attached to

00:18:55.875 --> 00:18:58.755
the fact that Jesus saved me.

00:18:58.965 --> 00:19:00.465
That's my motivation.

00:19:00.675 --> 00:19:04.515
That's how I'm going to steward the
gospel is that it's all connected.

00:19:04.515 --> 00:19:07.665
And so for us in this
place, how are we steward?

00:19:09.135 --> 00:19:12.045
'cause he's talked earlier in
this letter about some of the

00:19:12.045 --> 00:19:14.805
purpose of each day, each day.

00:19:14.865 --> 00:19:18.315
My purpose should be to
build the temple of God.

00:19:18.495 --> 00:19:22.785
At the end of chapter two, he's
referencing the temple as an

00:19:22.785 --> 00:19:25.245
illustration of who we are in Christ.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.150
I know the letters.

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.520
You said we're a body than
all believers are connected.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:34.050
And as the body of Christ, but in
this letter, he references and uses

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.630
the idea of a building of a temple.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.370
And he said, Jesus is the cornerstone.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:43.140
He's the first stone in from that, every
believer that comes into the family of.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.760
Is a stone that builds upon the
cornerstone and God is constructing

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.790
this temple made up of the
lives of people who choose him.

00:19:51.389 --> 00:19:55.650
And so we, every single day are
trying to build the temple of God.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.620
We're trying to, as a corporate
body is being built into a giant

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.110
simple, we're trying to, as
individual lives of Christians

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.610
are being developed into temples.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.980
So I'm trying to invest
in the mission of Jesus.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:05.280
I want to.

00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:07.125
On mission.

00:20:07.245 --> 00:20:11.445
I'm going to realize that God has
a role for me to play in his, his

00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:16.245
goal is to save those who are lost
and he has a role for me in that.

00:20:16.245 --> 00:20:20.235
And so I'm at all times seeking to
bring new people in I'm all times

00:20:20.475 --> 00:20:24.524
trying to share the gospel, serve
the loss, express the love of Jesus

00:20:24.764 --> 00:20:28.514
and be obedient to the instructions
that God gives me on a daily basis.

00:20:28.605 --> 00:20:29.475
So every single.

00:20:30.165 --> 00:20:34.245
My life should be about that investing
in the mission of Jesus, but it should

00:20:34.245 --> 00:20:36.375
also include investing in my temple.

00:20:36.615 --> 00:20:40.125
Paul would also say at the end of chapter
two, that you individually are a temple

00:20:40.125 --> 00:20:46.095
because you house, God, God, his spirit
lives within you when you receive Jesus.

00:20:46.305 --> 00:20:51.165
And so you are a temple, a
living, breathing habitat for God.

00:20:51.165 --> 00:20:55.275
And so not only do we want to seek
to build up the larger temple that

00:20:55.275 --> 00:20:58.965
is made up of individual followers
of Jesus, but we want to develop.

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:04.200
Our life as a residing place, as a
resting place, as a place where God lives.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.310
And so how do I do that?

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:09.210
I pray, I spend time in prayer
talking to the father, allowing him

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:10.950
to shape and guide and direct me.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.140
And when I pray, I don't
just talk the whole time.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.900
Sometimes I listen and allow him to speak.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.960
I heard a pastor this week,
somebody asked him and said, in

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.630
your 30 years of ministry, what
would you have done differently?

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.930
And he said in my 30 years of ministry,
what I would have done differently

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.100
is I would have prayed more.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.210
I would have planned.

00:21:28.665 --> 00:21:29.895
I would have prayed more.

00:21:30.075 --> 00:21:31.095
I would've planned less.

00:21:31.095 --> 00:21:34.965
You want to build up the temple of your
life into something that God can use.

00:21:35.175 --> 00:21:37.004
We need to pray more.

00:21:37.155 --> 00:21:39.165
I need to read my Bible
and not just read it.

00:21:39.165 --> 00:21:40.575
I need to meditate on scripture.

00:21:40.605 --> 00:21:42.135
There's going to be some
verses along the way.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:43.335
The holy spirit is going to point out.

00:21:44.295 --> 00:21:47.055
We need to do something with this verse,
and you're just gonna take some time to

00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:48.585
think about it and what that looks like.

00:21:48.855 --> 00:21:53.055
And so we want to meditate on that and
allow him to, to shape us and to guide us.

00:21:53.055 --> 00:21:56.085
And then we want to be obedient
to what he's given us through.

00:21:56.085 --> 00:22:00.315
And we'll be connected to a local church
just like this one that follows scripture,

00:22:00.435 --> 00:22:05.175
that honors God and all that they do
and be connected in serve in that way.

00:22:05.175 --> 00:22:09.015
And so if I'm going to be a steward
of the gospel, it's going to start

00:22:09.165 --> 00:22:10.755
with me having the right reason.

00:22:10.875 --> 00:22:12.405
I'm going to have the right motivation.

00:22:13.125 --> 00:22:16.995
Secondly, I'm going to
give away what I receive.

00:22:17.355 --> 00:22:20.505
I'm going to give away what I
receive in verses two and three.

00:22:20.745 --> 00:22:24.105
We see that he said, assuming that
you've heard of the stewardship of

00:22:24.105 --> 00:22:28.395
God's grace, that was given to me for
you, how the mystery was made, known

00:22:28.395 --> 00:22:30.225
to me, my revelation as I have written.

00:22:31.905 --> 00:22:35.264
So he's dwelling on his call
as an apostle to the Gentiles.

00:22:35.385 --> 00:22:38.834
So God gave him a direct
mission for these folks.

00:22:38.834 --> 00:22:42.435
The folks that had been outside of the
nation of Israel, the ones that weren't

00:22:42.435 --> 00:22:44.925
allowed, had access to God in the temple.

00:22:45.375 --> 00:22:50.115
And so from his view, he'd been entrusted
with a special office, a special calling.

00:22:50.115 --> 00:22:55.514
He gets to be the first that brings kind
of this revolutionary idea to these.

00:22:56.409 --> 00:22:59.469
And it stemmed back just like we
talked about just a minute, get

00:22:59.469 --> 00:23:01.120
it stemmed back from his calling.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.110
So let's read together in the book of
acts chapter nine, because I want you

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.280
to see kind of the descriptor of what's
going on because it helps us understand

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:14.500
how passionate and how motivated he is
as he's being a steward of this gospel.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.659
So in acts chapter nine, verse one,
it says this, but Paul was still

00:23:19.659 --> 00:23:21.250
breathing, threats and murder.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.420
Against the disciples of the Lord.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:28.560
He went to the high priest and he
asked him for letters to the synagogues

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.430
at Damascus, so that if he found
any belonging to the way meaning

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:37.350
followers of Jesus or women, he
might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.370
Now, as he went on his way, he
approached Damascus and suddenly

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.700
a light from heaven flashed around
him and falling to the ground.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.590
He heard a voice saying to him,
Saul, Saul, why are you persecuted?

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.200
And he said, who are you Lord?

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:57.780
And he said, I am Jesus, whom you are
persecuting, but rise and enter the city.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.970
And you will be told what you are.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:04.560
Now verse seven, the men who were
traveling with him stood speechless,

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.010
hearing the voice, but seeing
no one saw rose from the ground.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:10.380
And although his eyes were
opened, he saw nothing.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.130
So they laid him by the hand
and brought him into Damascus.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:19.560
And for three days he was without
sight and neither ate nor drank.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.740
So he has this encounter with
God that changed his life.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.270
And so right after that, God sends a
guy and it gives instruction to a guy

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.010
named Anna Naya says, Hey, this thing is.

00:24:29.865 --> 00:24:32.145
To Saul, his life has been changed.

00:24:32.265 --> 00:24:36.525
You need to go and lay hands on him and
pray over him so that he can regain.

00:24:37.275 --> 00:24:41.055
Now, and an ISP knows the reputation
of Saul, that he is a murderer.

00:24:41.055 --> 00:24:44.325
Here's the guy, a persecutor of
Christians, of people just like him.

00:24:44.325 --> 00:24:45.195
And so he balks it.

00:24:45.195 --> 00:24:47.115
That idea is like, I don't think so.

00:24:47.295 --> 00:24:48.915
That's not the guy I'm going to go visit.

00:24:48.915 --> 00:24:51.975
I don't care if you say he's blind
or what I'm not going, but then

00:24:51.975 --> 00:24:55.305
God responds and gives kind of
the punchline to the whole deal.

00:24:55.515 --> 00:25:00.795
God says, go for, he is a chosen
instrument of mine to carry my name

00:25:00.795 --> 00:25:03.735
before the Gentiles and the Kings in the.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.290
Of Israel.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.390
God had saved Paul.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:11.980
He changed his life for one
specific reason so that Gentiles

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.630
could know about the gospel.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.590
That was his calling and it
shaped everything that he had.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.810
And so he was told this by God.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.300
And so then he spent the rest
of his life telling other

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.130
people what he had been told.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.700
He was giving away that,
which he had received.

00:25:29.294 --> 00:25:33.764
And so he says in here, don't assume,
or he says, assuming you have heard,

00:25:33.764 --> 00:25:35.085
so that's what he's referencing.

00:25:35.325 --> 00:25:37.004
Is that assuming you've
heard what happened?

00:25:37.254 --> 00:25:37.635
God.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.919
To me and gave us a message.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:44.550
And it's a game changer, assuming
you've heard all of those things.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.100
That's why I'm now saying what it is.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:47.700
I'm saying.

00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:51.720
So a couple of just side observations
for us about this idea of assuming

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.379
my father, one of the favorite
things he likes to say is assumption

00:25:55.379 --> 00:25:57.570
is the lowest form of knowledge.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.899
If you set it, what he said at 975,000.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.800
In my lifetime and almost all
of them are directed towards me.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.190
And so assumption is the
lowest form of knowledge.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.590
And so I'm not getting onto
Paul for saying, assuming you've

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:15.090
heard, I'm just saying for us,
let's not assume some stuff.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.540
Let's not assume that everybody
understands exactly what the gospel.

00:26:19.274 --> 00:26:20.534
So let's go ahead and say it.

00:26:20.685 --> 00:26:21.705
Let's go ahead and share it.

00:26:21.705 --> 00:26:25.754
Let's not assume let's not assume
everybody knows your testimony.

00:26:25.995 --> 00:26:28.544
Let's not assume that everybody
knows exactly what God's

00:26:28.544 --> 00:26:29.804
doing in your life right now.

00:26:30.014 --> 00:26:34.064
Those are things that need to be on the
forefront of your mouth and on your lips

00:26:34.064 --> 00:26:37.965
so that people can hear, because we don't
want to assume that everybody understands

00:26:37.965 --> 00:26:41.804
that the gospels boil down to the fact
that Jesus loves you so very much.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.650
That even though you were separated from
him because of sin in your life, that

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:49.130
he bridged the gap, then you made it
possible for you to have relationship

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.380
with him because he loves you that much.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:56.090
And so to bridge the gap, he sent Jesus to
die on a cross that even though he didn't

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.890
deserve to die it then nothing wrong.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:59.600
He lived sinless life.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.270
He paid the debt for sin for you.

00:27:02.794 --> 00:27:06.455
He paid the price that you and I
deserved to pay, but then three days

00:27:06.455 --> 00:27:10.175
later, God raised him back to life
and in the process defeated death.

00:27:10.235 --> 00:27:13.955
So now you don't have to die
spiritually and be separated from him.

00:27:14.135 --> 00:27:17.195
And when you physically die,
you will no longer be separated.

00:27:17.195 --> 00:27:20.105
You will be with him
in heaven and in glory.

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:23.764
And so we were able to have relationship
with him now and experience him now.

00:27:23.764 --> 00:27:26.855
And then we get to experience him
even more in complete fulfillment

00:27:27.034 --> 00:27:29.225
when we see him face to face.

00:27:29.405 --> 00:27:30.965
And that is the gospel in Romans.

00:27:30.965 --> 00:27:32.044
Tim would say the only.

00:27:32.649 --> 00:27:35.409
The only thing you got to do to
be saved is to believe you got to

00:27:35.409 --> 00:27:37.750
believe that he was, God, you got
to believe that he was perfect.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.669
You had to believe that he was, he died.

00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:41.679
And then three days later,
he raised back to life.

00:27:41.679 --> 00:27:45.280
And if you believe that and you
confess it, you're saved, that's it.

00:27:45.429 --> 00:27:47.199
But let's not assume that
everybody knows that.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.570
So we need to have that conversation.

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:50.320
We need to share.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.030
If it's that good news, then I
need to share it on a regular.

00:27:55.035 --> 00:27:57.105
There is power in your testimony.

00:27:57.525 --> 00:28:01.725
There is power in you sharing the stories
of what God has done in your life.

00:28:01.875 --> 00:28:04.665
What God is teaching you and doing in
your life right now, and what you're

00:28:04.665 --> 00:28:06.705
believing him for down the road.

00:28:06.825 --> 00:28:09.225
There are people that
need to hear your story.

00:28:09.225 --> 00:28:13.155
It's going to empower them and
bolster them and give them courage

00:28:13.275 --> 00:28:14.595
to take the next step in their.

00:28:16.155 --> 00:28:18.075
There is power in your testimony.

00:28:18.195 --> 00:28:20.175
You need to hear your testimony.

00:28:20.175 --> 00:28:24.015
Sometimes one of the things I've found
is then this last year is that I give

00:28:24.015 --> 00:28:28.755
testimony that what God is doing, it
empowers me and it happened to me, but I'm

00:28:28.755 --> 00:28:31.035
being reminded of it in the moment of how.

00:28:31.595 --> 00:28:35.375
Faithful and how God did a thing that
only he can do, which gives me fuel

00:28:35.375 --> 00:28:38.405
and motivation to be courageous, to
step into the next thing that he's

00:28:38.405 --> 00:28:40.655
asking me to do that only he can do.

00:28:40.655 --> 00:28:44.495
And so not only does it encourage
and empower other people, but it

00:28:44.495 --> 00:28:48.875
can do the same for you, even though
it has already happened to you.

00:28:48.875 --> 00:28:54.005
So let's not assume that everybody always
knows exactly what all is going on.

00:28:54.125 --> 00:28:55.775
I do this with my wife all the time.

00:28:55.775 --> 00:28:58.105
We'll be at dinner and I'll be
telling a story and she'll look at me.

00:28:58.135 --> 00:29:00.615
She goes, You didn't tell me that.

00:29:00.855 --> 00:29:04.155
And it's because I assume I've told her
already, I've tell all these other people

00:29:04.155 --> 00:29:05.565
and she ends up being the last one.

00:29:05.565 --> 00:29:10.995
So don't assume that you are, that
everybody knows your story matters.

00:29:12.105 --> 00:29:14.294
Your story is important.

00:29:14.955 --> 00:29:18.225
Your story is intended to be shared.

00:29:20.514 --> 00:29:24.085
And when we share, we are giving
away what we have received.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.900
And we are stewarding the gospel.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.830
The flow of the gospel is not
intended to stop with you.

00:29:33.149 --> 00:29:38.010
When I was graduating from seminary
back in 2011, I attended an

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.310
extension center for new Orleans
Baptist, theological seminary.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.550
I was in Atlanta, but it
was attached to that school.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:47.190
And so when I graduated, we
went back to the main campus

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.570
in new Orleans for graduation.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:53.070
And while we were there, the entire
talk of the news and the radio and

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.570
everything going on was the river.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.370
The river was at flood stage.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.800
And so they're having
this constant dialogue.

00:29:59.675 --> 00:30:03.185
Are they going to open up the
drains and keep it from overflowing?

00:30:03.185 --> 00:30:05.495
Or are they not going to take
a risk and flood the city?

00:30:05.495 --> 00:30:08.945
And so we're less, we're still less
than 10 years from when Katrina

00:30:08.945 --> 00:30:10.175
had happened and all the flooding.

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:14.555
And so this was the constant
conversation on all the media outlets.

00:30:15.104 --> 00:30:19.125
So on Saturday of that weekend, they
decided they're going to open the drains.

00:30:19.304 --> 00:30:24.584
And so they go, they take a crew out,
a video camera out and they're filming

00:30:24.794 --> 00:30:28.844
the actual drains in the side of these
levees as they begin to open them.

00:30:29.205 --> 00:30:30.645
And so we're watching this thing.

00:30:30.645 --> 00:30:33.014
We've been listening for three days,
and so now we're going to watch.

00:30:33.014 --> 00:30:36.495
And so they began to open these
giant greats and they start

00:30:36.495 --> 00:30:37.695
opening them up in immediate.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.630
When they started to open them,
there was a little bit of water.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.090
You could kind of see a
splashing kind of thing.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.120
And then before long they're
wide open and there is water

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.820
just pouring out of these drains.

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:53.200
I mean, going everywhere, more
water than you can keep up with.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.995
And, but within minutes, The entire ground
is gone around the areas where these

00:30:58.995 --> 00:31:00.905
dreams are, and that's why they hesitate.

00:31:00.955 --> 00:31:04.245
They don't want to open the drains is
because it's going to mess up the crops

00:31:04.455 --> 00:31:06.645
and th the land where this is happening.

00:31:06.645 --> 00:31:09.825
And so they're opening these drains up,
you know, north of the city trying to

00:31:09.825 --> 00:31:11.805
save the city, but it's going to mess up.

00:31:12.274 --> 00:31:14.915
The immediately the land, where
that lane is going to get flooded.

00:31:14.915 --> 00:31:15.695
And that's what happened.

00:31:15.705 --> 00:31:18.754
I mean, within minutes, there's
water gushing everywhere.

00:31:18.905 --> 00:31:21.004
And before long, you
can't even see the ground.

00:31:21.004 --> 00:31:21.965
You just see the water.

00:31:22.145 --> 00:31:23.435
And that's a good picture.

00:31:23.435 --> 00:31:26.344
I think of what God desires
to do with the gospel with us.

00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:32.104
W we, if our, if our drain, if our gate is
shut and it stops with me, that's not the.

00:31:32.835 --> 00:31:34.695
The goal was that it
would come into my life.

00:31:34.725 --> 00:31:36.945
It would change my life
in flow out of my life.

00:31:37.155 --> 00:31:39.615
And everywhere that I go,
that it would just get on me.

00:31:39.615 --> 00:31:41.385
It would flood the area where I go.

00:31:41.505 --> 00:31:46.035
So when I'm at work, the is flooded
with the gospel and when I'm at home, my

00:31:46.035 --> 00:31:48.225
family is flooded with the love of Jesus.

00:31:48.375 --> 00:31:51.525
And when I coach my son's baseball
team, those eight year old would

00:31:51.525 --> 00:31:55.935
know the love of Jesus because it is
flowing out because I am set to open.

00:31:56.115 --> 00:31:56.445
I am.

00:31:57.159 --> 00:31:58.149
I am open.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.909
And when I do that, I am
stewarding the gospel.

00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:04.929
I am giving away what it
is he has given to me.

00:32:05.199 --> 00:32:07.240
And so if we're going to be
stewards of the gospel, we've

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.379
got to have the right reason.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.689
We've got to give away
what we've been given.

00:32:10.689 --> 00:32:15.550
And then thirdly, and finally
God desires to speak through you.

00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:18.610
That's a part of his mission.

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:25.330
He's decided the best way to reach the
world with the gospel is through you.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.470
You could have done it any
way you wanted to do it.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:33.570
And he's chosen to use folks like you and
I followers of him, regular old people,

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.030
even ones that haven't been to seminary.

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:36.780
Can you believe it?

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.530
The message is revolutionary.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:50.660
And I think it's hard for us to
grasp how revolutionary it was

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:55.190
in this moment for Gentiles to be
told you can have access to this.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.820
I think we've probably all experienced
on some levels, some more than others

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.560
of what it feels like to be told.

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:03.540
Nope, you're not welcome here.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.590
You're not enough.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:07.380
Whatever that thing is, it's not for you.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:12.900
This is to the highest degree Gentiles.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.450
There was a sign in the temple that said.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.060
Foreigners can come no further.

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:21.150
This is as far you're not allowed to
actually you can get to the courtyard.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.200
You're not actually allowed to
go in because you see God resides

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.030
within there and you're not welcome.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:32.640
So to the degree it was, you're not
a part of this, this isn't for you.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.640
Now Paul's coming and saying, guess what?

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.720
The game has changed.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.060
Jesus said, actually, it's for everybody.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.970
And so he gets to be the first one
that brings this revolutionary message

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.410
and there was some parts about it.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.390
And this is where he's
getting into the mystery.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.190
He refers to it as the mystery.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:54.510
And he's going to reveal the mystery of
the gospel for these Gentile believers.

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.680
And it was this he's saying that
they get to be fellow heirs with him.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.780
They are now a part of the family of God.

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:05.400
When you choose Jesus, you
are a part of God's family.

00:34:06.555 --> 00:34:10.025
He said they were going to be fellow
members of the same body in chapter.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:15.480
In verse 10, it said that when you
receive Jesus, you are a new creation

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.800
created for works that are going to
give evidence that God is real and

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.880
that he loves the world and that
he's come to die and save the world.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:27.570
And so that's why we were created
as a new creation, but then in chat

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:32.040
a little later in chapter two, he's
going to refer to a new race of people.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.490
He came to unify people,
not to divide people.

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:37.800
And so he said, I'm coming to unify.

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:41.260
Jew and Gentile as a new race of people.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:44.230
I'm not bringing the Gentiles
up to the level of the Jews.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:45.460
Who've already got it all figured out.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:50.140
No, I'm elevating them both up into
something completely new, the same,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.820
the same race, the same type of people,
the same new creation along the way.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.660
And so when the Gentiles, when
they received Jesus, when someone

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:02.500
received Jesus, they are a fellow
member of the body of Christ.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:06.820
And then he also says you are a partaker
in the promise promises of Christ.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:14.550
Now to partake is to join in is to eat
or drink, to, to, to consume whatever

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:17.010
it is that's going along at that time.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:18.780
And so look, you get to be a part of it.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.720
There's all these promises in these
covenants that God had made all

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.320
the way back in the old Testament
in now you are a part of that.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.880
It is for you.

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:28.290
It includes you.

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:31.710
You get to participate
and partake in that.

00:35:32.505 --> 00:35:36.255
Over in second Thessalonians chapter
two, verse 14, he would say it this way.

00:35:36.255 --> 00:35:40.245
Paul said to this, he called you
through the gospel so that you

00:35:40.245 --> 00:35:42.045
may obtain glory of our Lord.

00:35:42.045 --> 00:35:43.095
Jesus Christ.

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:48.135
There are good things found
in the body of Christ.

00:35:48.255 --> 00:35:51.285
There are good things that come
when we give our life to Jesus.

00:35:51.285 --> 00:35:55.215
And he's saying it's a revolutionary
message because he's saying

00:35:55.215 --> 00:35:56.895
it's now available to everybody.

00:35:57.855 --> 00:35:59.355
There's no one who's excluded.

00:35:59.355 --> 00:36:00.105
It's available.

00:36:00.105 --> 00:36:01.455
Everybody gets the opportunity.

00:36:02.205 --> 00:36:03.045
To receive it.

00:36:03.615 --> 00:36:07.245
And so the truth is for us in
this place, we are stewards of

00:36:07.245 --> 00:36:10.215
this same revolutionary message.

00:36:11.445 --> 00:36:19.275
We are given the opportunity to
share and to speak this same message.

00:36:19.695 --> 00:36:20.595
It's our goal.

00:36:20.685 --> 00:36:21.585
It's our role.

00:36:21.585 --> 00:36:22.845
It's what we're supposed to do.

00:36:23.355 --> 00:36:23.895
Now.

00:36:25.005 --> 00:36:26.595
This isn't the way it works, but as soon.

00:36:28.095 --> 00:36:32.835
That for someone to receive Jesus, they
had to interact with the gospel 26 times

00:36:33.044 --> 00:36:37.064
in various ways, assuming that it took
26 interactions with the gospel, for

00:36:37.064 --> 00:36:38.654
someone to give their life to Jesus.

00:36:38.924 --> 00:36:41.805
And so to kind of give us a picture
of that, imagine that I strung a.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:45.540
From like a clothesline
from this wall to this wall.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.040
And along that wall, put 26 cards
up there, a lettered, a through Z to

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.020
represent there's 26 interactions.

00:36:52.259 --> 00:36:56.069
And somebody has to have 26
interactions with the gospel before

00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:57.779
they would become a Christian.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.140
And then if I were to ask you, which
one of those is the most important

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.940
step most of the time intuitively we
would think the one where they become.

00:37:05.955 --> 00:37:10.245
So the last one from Y to Z, but
the truth is that every single

00:37:10.245 --> 00:37:11.835
one of those steps are important.

00:37:11.865 --> 00:37:17.025
If it took 26 interactions with
the gospel, then all 26 matter.

00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:18.735
Now, what does that mean for you?

00:37:18.825 --> 00:37:22.245
Because sometimes when we share the
gospel and we share our faith and we

00:37:22.245 --> 00:37:26.850
ask somebody, if they want to receive
Jesus, And I walk away from that

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.480
interaction feeling defeated and feeling
like maybe I don't ever want to do that

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.740
again, because that was rejection and
rejection hurts and rejection stinks.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:36.029
And I don't want that again.

00:37:36.029 --> 00:37:38.730
So I'm not even going to put
myself out there because if I do

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:40.140
it again, they may say no again.

00:37:41.085 --> 00:37:45.195
Well guess what, if there are walking
along those 26 interactions, they've just

00:37:45.195 --> 00:37:49.785
had another interaction with Jesus that
it's your job to have interactions with

00:37:49.785 --> 00:37:52.755
people it's God's job to save people.

00:37:52.905 --> 00:37:57.165
And when I get that out of whack, I
stopped doing the exact thing he's asking

00:37:57.165 --> 00:37:58.665
me to do, because I'm trying to do what.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:00.930
I want to see people saved.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:04.290
And so the moment I share salvation
with them, share the gospel with them.

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:04.980
They don't receive it.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.140
Then I don't, I don't do it
anymore because they rejected me.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:10.380
And so being able to remember
that it's not my job.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.690
I want to release you from
the weight of that today.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.770
If nothing else happens, just be
reminded that only God can save people,

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.570
but he's choosing, he was chosen
and he chooses every single day to

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.610
communicate that message through you.

00:38:25.975 --> 00:38:28.945
So to be stewards of the gospel,
we've got to recognize that he

00:38:28.945 --> 00:38:34.135
wants to speak through me, that
your voice is important that your

00:38:34.135 --> 00:38:36.535
voice, your life, it is noteworthy.

00:38:38.635 --> 00:38:42.235
It's your life is such a big
deal that Jesus died for you.

00:38:44.135 --> 00:38:47.915
You, because he wants to
do something through you.

00:38:47.915 --> 00:38:50.885
He wants to have relationship
with you that makes your life no.

00:38:51.779 --> 00:38:55.049
When somebody is willing to lay down their
life for you, that means you're valuable.

00:38:55.770 --> 00:39:00.810
So be encouraged in this place today that
God loves you very much, be challenged

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:04.470
in this place that I realized that
God doesn't want it to stop with you.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.770
If you're one of those that have received
Jesus, and you're a Christ follower,

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.270
it's not supposed to stop with you.

00:39:09.839 --> 00:39:12.660
It's supposed to continue
supposed to flow through you.

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.720
And so our question today that
we're going to finish with is this,

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:18.600
what are you doing with the gospel?

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.960
Because we're all stewards of the gospel.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.610
Even if I never choose salvation,
I am stewarding the gospel and

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:27.810
that's how I'm stewarding it.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.850
I'm deciding I'm not going
to do anything with it.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:30.930
I don't want it.

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.370
I'm going to say no.

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:38.490
So each and every person gets to
steward the gospel and it starts there.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.450
If I received the gift of
salvation, then it's about what am

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:43.620
I doing to share it with others?

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:48.150
But we've all been given the
gift it's available to all of us.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:51.060
He didn't randomly pick people
out of a phone book and say,

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.650
you get the chance at salvation.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.490
Not at all.

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:56.070
He died for each and every
person who's ever lived.

00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.380
So it's available.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:01.300
I get to decide what
I'm going to do with it.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.030
I get to decide how I'm
going to respond to it.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:08.980
Paul understood that as a follower
of Jesus, it should affect each

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.450
and every aspect of his life.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.300
And that's how he chose
to steward the gospel.

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:16.485
For the believers in this room,
you've been given the same

00:40:16.485 --> 00:40:19.035
responsibility to pass that along.

00:40:20.295 --> 00:40:23.325
And for those in the room that have
made them, never had that time yet where

00:40:23.325 --> 00:40:27.404
they've given their, their life to Jesus,
they haven't received the gift yet.

00:40:27.944 --> 00:40:29.145
That's your next step?

00:40:29.475 --> 00:40:32.085
And that's what I've been praying for
all week long is that this would be the

00:40:32.085 --> 00:40:33.404
moment today where you say, you know what?

00:40:33.615 --> 00:40:35.805
This is the time when I received the gift.

00:40:35.985 --> 00:40:40.485
A gift is great to be given a
gift to be given an inheritance.

00:40:41.774 --> 00:40:43.605
But it matters more
about what to do with it.

00:40:44.504 --> 00:40:45.044
Right.

00:40:45.975 --> 00:40:47.325
I can bring you a gift.

00:40:47.415 --> 00:40:48.915
It can be wrapped up and look great.

00:40:48.915 --> 00:40:51.944
And if you never opened the
gift, it does you absolutely.

00:40:51.944 --> 00:40:52.154
No.

00:40:52.154 --> 00:40:52.455
Good.

00:40:54.314 --> 00:40:56.234
And so I would encourage
you today in this place.

00:40:56.234 --> 00:40:58.605
If you're a person that says,
you know what, I know a lot about

00:40:58.605 --> 00:41:00.795
God, I know about salvation.

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:04.005
I know the whole thing I've been in
church my whole life, but I, I don't know

00:41:04.005 --> 00:41:05.895
that I've ever actually opened the gift.

00:41:06.105 --> 00:41:07.785
I would encourage you to do that today.

00:41:07.905 --> 00:41:10.575
That's the best thing you could
do to steward the gospel of the

00:41:10.575 --> 00:41:13.995
day would be to open the gift
and receive him in this place.

00:41:15.375 --> 00:41:18.285
So friends, what are we
going to do with the gospel?

00:41:18.615 --> 00:41:19.185
Let's pray.

00:41:25.275 --> 00:41:31.425
God, you are a good God and we have spent
time praising you and singing about that.

00:41:33.405 --> 00:41:36.825
And so I just want to reiterate that
in this place, we praise you because

00:41:36.825 --> 00:41:38.745
you did what none of us could do.

00:41:38.745 --> 00:41:43.995
And you paid a price that none of
us could pay and still have life.

00:41:44.025 --> 00:41:46.665
And so father, I thank you that
you've done what is necessary

00:41:46.665 --> 00:41:48.105
for us to be able to have Sal.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.760
I'm grateful for the gospel.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.970
I'm grateful for people all throughout
history who have communicated that

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:55.260
it hasn't just stayed with them.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.610
They've passed it on today.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:58.920
We looked at a letter from the
apostle Paul, where he did that.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.200
He dedicated his life, but
there've been a lot of others.

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:04.260
I've got relatives who
didn't keep it to themselves.

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.860
They shared it with me along.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.870
And so father, we just want to take
a moment right now and say, thank you

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:11.640
for working in the lives of people.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.980
Thank you for doing a
work that only you can do.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.400
Thank you for including us in the work
you didn't have to, but as Paul would

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.260
say, it's a privilege to be a part.

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.930
It's a privilege to have a role to play.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.580
So father, I pray right now in this time,
the holy spirit would have the freedom

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:32.760
to speak to us in our heart and our
soul to point out what our next step.

00:42:36.045 --> 00:42:42.585
Some of us need to be rebuked a little bit
because we're not stewarding the gospel

00:42:42.585 --> 00:42:46.455
the way that you would want us to, and you
need to be able to point that out in our

00:42:46.455 --> 00:42:48.005
life and we need to be able to receive.

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:55.680
Repentive that and move forward
and be better and do what it

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.939
is, what you're asking us to do.

00:42:58.529 --> 00:43:01.859
Some of us in this place at eight
need to be reminded that we matter

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.799
and that our testimony matters.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:06.390
No.

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:09.779
What we have to say matters, not because
of who we are, but because of who you

00:43:09.779 --> 00:43:14.490
are residing within us and by your
authority, we have the opportunity

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:16.439
to share meaningful information.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.359
So father, I pray that you would love on
those people in this place, that you would

00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:26.009
encourage them and you would embolden
them and you would empower them to walk

00:43:26.009 --> 00:43:32.490
out of this room in a whole new sense of
self and a whole new sense of courage of

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:37.080
realizing that they're not alone, that
you are with them striving, right beside

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.660
them seeking and desiring to lead the way.

00:43:43.064 --> 00:43:44.174
And then there's others in the room.

00:43:44.174 --> 00:43:46.274
Father have never received
you, and they've never

00:43:46.274 --> 00:43:47.774
opened the gift of salvation.

00:43:48.464 --> 00:43:50.504
They may have heard it for the
first time today, or maybe they've

00:43:50.504 --> 00:43:52.035
heard it for the hundred 50th time.

00:43:53.055 --> 00:43:54.314
They weren't quite ready.

00:43:54.555 --> 00:43:55.754
They had more questions.

00:43:55.785 --> 00:43:58.845
They had more things will father,
I believe today's the day that you

00:43:58.845 --> 00:44:00.404
desire for them to come to know you.

00:44:01.904 --> 00:44:03.645
And so if that is you
in this place happening.

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:08.220
To nail that down today, there is no
better stewarding of the gospel that

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:13.290
you can do then to know for sure that
you are saved, it all flows out of that.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.320
You can't be a good steward
until you've received the gift

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.330
and received the blessing.

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:19.560
And so if that is.

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:24.120
During this time of invitation, you can
come up front and you can talk to me.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.950
You can talk to pastor Ben.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:29.700
We'd love to help, you know,
uh, the ins and outs and just

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:31.050
being able to pray with you.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.870
But ultimately it's just about
you believing you don't have

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:35.040
to come up here to do that.

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:37.890
You don't have to sign a card to do that.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.470
Romans ten nine says that
for those that believe.

00:44:41.265 --> 00:44:44.355
And the con in their heart and confess
with their mouth that they shall be saved.

00:44:44.355 --> 00:44:45.465
And so that's what it's about.

00:44:46.035 --> 00:44:49.904
And I could not encourage
you more to do it today,

00:44:53.595 --> 00:44:56.145
father, I pray right now in this
time of invitation, you'd have the

00:44:56.145 --> 00:45:00.615
freedom to do what only you can do to
change lives of people individually,

00:45:00.615 --> 00:45:03.404
but to change this community, to
change the city of Cincinnati and

00:45:03.404 --> 00:45:08.145
ultimately the changed state of
Ohio, you're doing it through people.

00:45:08.475 --> 00:45:09.285
You always have.

00:45:09.285 --> 00:45:09.735
You always.

00:45:10.544 --> 00:45:11.595
We want to be a part of that.

00:45:12.825 --> 00:45:15.404
Thank you for allowing us to be a
part of your family and your name.

00:45:15.404 --> 00:45:15.765
I pray.

00:45:16.035 --> 00:45:16.455
Amen.
