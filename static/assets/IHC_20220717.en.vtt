00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.200
So Lord Jesus, we just pray Lord that you
are, uh, glorified and magnified today.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.290
Lord, through preaching and
Lord, just pray for Nick Lord.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.560
I pray for his heart, uh, that he
continues to just lean into you Lord

00:00:13.565 --> 00:00:17.670
today, as he speaks, may your truths
reign through his heart, through his

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.470
words and through your word Lord.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.320
And we pray for lives to be changed
today, Lord, so we just pray this in here.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.710
Have the name.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.370
Amen.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.020
Amen.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.470
Amen.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.471
Amen.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.880
Uh, thank you, Ben.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.850
Uh, I am excited that you
guys are planning our church.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.620
And I told our team, I said, listen,
our mission and our project, our, our

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.640
whole purpose to go to Cincinnati is
we want to encourage you guys because

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.690
we believe in what you're doing.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.550
So thank you for being obedient.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.320
Thank you for showing up here.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.660
Week after week, helping
Ben and his family.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.400
Uh, thank you for being a part of this and
having his desire to reach this community.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.100
Uh, the reason I am really
excited about that is because I.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.640
Not someone who grew up in church.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.130
I was not a Christian from birth.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.470
Neither were you, but you
understand what I'm saying?

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.550
I didn't grow up in church and,
uh, I didn't come to faith until,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.230
uh, until I was in high school and
my family was, uh, very broken.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.960
My father was a drug addict and, uh, I
dealt with those dynamics in my home.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.500
You would.

00:01:17.505 --> 00:01:21.735
Come into my home and it, it, you
wouldn't sense any presence of God

00:01:21.735 --> 00:01:24.465
or , uh, anything wholly about it.

00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:26.175
It was like the opposite.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:34.095
And so, um, that was my family and I was a
teenager that was miserable and depressed

00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:39.615
and, uh, struggling with, you know,
wondering if life was even worth living.

00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:42.315
And, uh, I felt hopeless.

00:01:42.885 --> 00:01:49.785
And so I was introduced to Christ as
a, as a 16 year old young man and, uh,

00:01:49.815 --> 00:01:52.575
prayed in my bedroom to receive Christ.

00:01:52.905 --> 00:01:55.905
And one of the things that changed
drastically in my life is I went

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.815
from someone who was hopeless
to someone who was hopeful.

00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:02.565
And, uh, I love that your name
of your church is inspire hope

00:02:02.925 --> 00:02:04.575
because that is the gospel.

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:05.835
The gospel is inspiring.

00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:07.245
Hope in people who are hopeless.

00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:10.605
Uh, and so today what I wanna do
is I wanna talk to you guys about

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:12.795
what it means to follow Christ.

00:02:13.155 --> 00:02:17.144
And the things that I've learned
along the way, because I was a rookie,

00:02:17.535 --> 00:02:21.584
uh, I didn't know, and understand
church lingo or church polity.

00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:23.714
Uh, none of that made sense to me.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.505
I didn't even know why people
did unspoken prayer requests.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.315
I was like, I thought praying was like,
speaking, why would you unspoken it?

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:30.614
You know?

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.904
So I was, uh, I was naive to,
to a lot of things in church.

00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:39.204
Uh, and the established churches that,
that happen are words that are being used.

00:02:39.445 --> 00:02:42.655
I didn't understand the word
righteousness cuz people don't walk over.

00:02:42.715 --> 00:02:43.644
Well, they do today.

00:02:43.644 --> 00:02:44.424
That's righteous.

00:02:44.424 --> 00:02:49.704
You know, guy guy says that on, uh, triple
D, but anyways, um, most people don't

00:02:49.704 --> 00:02:54.355
walk around using words, righteousness
or holiness or justification.

00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:56.275
And uh, I had no idea
what those words meant.

00:02:57.045 --> 00:02:57.795
As a young man.

00:02:57.795 --> 00:03:00.615
And so, um, I wanna just
share with you guys today.

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:04.605
Uh, it is good to be here and
our team is, is super excited

00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:06.015
and we're from South Carolina.

00:03:06.015 --> 00:03:10.155
We are about 20 minutes outside
of Greenville, South Carolina.

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:15.255
Uh, and we really like to say to, to
you guys that we're really only about

00:03:15.255 --> 00:03:17.085
20 minutes from Clemson university.

00:03:17.505 --> 00:03:20.295
Um, we know Ben is an Oklahoma guy.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.790
They stole one of our football
coaches, but we're okay with that.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.350
Uh, and, um, so we were there at
the foothills where the, uh, the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.490
Appalachian mountains began and, uh,
we, we, we live in a beautiful place.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.170
And so, but we're excited to be here in,
in Ohio, into to minister with you guys,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.040
uh, today, if you have your Bible, go
ahead and turn to Matthew chapter 16.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.560
Uh, I think some of these
will be on the screen.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.490
You can follow along with.

00:03:45.075 --> 00:03:48.735
Uh, and we're gonna jump into this
theme of following Jesus because

00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:53.385
being a Christian, isn't about
just putting a label on yourself.

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:56.805
Uh, being a Christian
is about a lifestyle.

00:03:57.105 --> 00:04:00.065
It's about a lifestyle that you're
embracing it's about your identity.

00:04:00.435 --> 00:04:03.045
It's not just a, a tagline to who you are.

00:04:03.315 --> 00:04:07.845
And so when you follow Christ, uh,
in our culture, uh, a lot of people

00:04:07.845 --> 00:04:09.585
misunderstand what that means.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.690
Some would say that means to be
associated with a church or to be

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.610
associated with this movement over here
or, uh, or different things like that.

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:23.940
But when we look at the scripture, uh,
Jesus himself is actually going to explain

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.290
what it really means to follow him and
the requirements that's laid out, uh, in

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.900
our culture, we use different things, um,
uh, to kind of communicate a following.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.390
One of the most popular
right now is in social media.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.190
We use a hashtag.

00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:41.895
Uh, for you younger of older
folks, that's the pound sign.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:47.805
Um, so, uh, we have these, uh, these
symbols that we use that is, uh,

00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:51.974
used to connect groups or topics, uh,
people together, people use that to,

00:04:52.155 --> 00:04:56.835
to try to get folks to follow a, uh,
um, a product or something, but that

00:04:56.835 --> 00:04:58.545
symbol promotes unity and identity.

00:04:58.935 --> 00:05:02.925
And many times those hashtags are
created intentionally to kind of

00:05:02.925 --> 00:05:04.755
create following on social media.

00:05:05.445 --> 00:05:08.294
So I think I have a picture
here of, of, of an example.

00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:10.484
These are some guys over in Lockland.

00:05:10.724 --> 00:05:14.984
When we came, uh, several months ago, a
team came up and was serving in Lockland

00:05:15.255 --> 00:05:20.354
and, um, they have these hazmat suits
on and, uh, you know, they're getting

00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:21.914
dirty and I was like, man, that's great.

00:05:21.914 --> 00:05:24.974
So a great example would be,
you could take this picture post

00:05:24.974 --> 00:05:26.445
on social media and go hashtag.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.280
pound serve Lockland.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.720
And that could kind of create some,
some kind of common, uh, threads there.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.110
But I really like my version
of this picture that I made.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.330
Um, it's the Lockland, um, PA Lupas
because I felt like they were, uh,

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.980
look ridiculous in that outfit.

00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:46.380
And so I was like, these
guys, uh, I gotta get it.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.540
So I, I made that picture of them.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.450
I changed their faces around
to the little guys and sent

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.280
it back to 'em and was a haha.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.540
And they, they didn't really think it was
funny, but so, um, So that's one way you

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.310
can use the hashtag it was an example.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.849
Uh, but have you ever thought about
this when you start thinking about

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.490
social media, uh, and the idea of it?

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.430
Why, why do people get so consumed?

00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:09.615
With that.

00:06:09.645 --> 00:06:13.155
Why is it so alluring to
us as, as individuals?

00:06:13.485 --> 00:06:18.375
I think sometimes it's because there's
a false promise of, of social connection

00:06:18.585 --> 00:06:24.675
or even this idea of, of you have a
platform to be known your own avenue,

00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:29.385
to be famous, uh, to promote yourself,
to promote your ideas, to remote what

00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:31.515
you think life is, uh, all about.

00:06:31.665 --> 00:06:35.205
And many people in our culture
use social media to grow their.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.770
They use it to grow a following.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.680
Maybe you would say, Hey, I
got 2000 friends on Facebook.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.900
Like I got people like tracking with me.

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.110
Uh, or maybe you have 2000
followers on Instagram.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.729
Um, you know, my, my generation,
I'm 36 years old, I think.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.930
Yeah, that's right.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.789
36, uh, people my age, we don't
have to do high school reunions

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.110
because we have Facebook.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.690
We know what every, what everybody's
doing in their life already.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.140
Right.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.030
So it's like, it's one of those kind of.

00:07:03.705 --> 00:07:04.455
But why is that?

00:07:04.515 --> 00:07:07.155
Why is those things so valuable to us?

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:11.174
I think as people, we have
this position in our heart to

00:07:11.174 --> 00:07:12.854
really follow after something.

00:07:13.905 --> 00:07:16.665
uh, have you ever known a friend or
maybe you've been that type of person

00:07:16.665 --> 00:07:19.935
where you've made a post on social
media and you just keep going back

00:07:19.935 --> 00:07:21.225
to check it, see, who's liked it.

00:07:21.225 --> 00:07:22.155
Who's commented on it.

00:07:22.455 --> 00:07:23.595
Sometimes that's really fun.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.955
Right.

00:07:24.285 --> 00:07:27.465
But sometimes it can be a little
ridiculous of like how many times we

00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:28.905
actually go back and check that thing.

00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:29.145
Right.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.195
There's something inside of me
craving something from that.

00:07:33.345 --> 00:07:35.415
And I'm a person like, I
like to think about stuff.

00:07:35.415 --> 00:07:38.025
I said, why is that true
for us as, as humans?

00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:43.215
Like, why are we so engaged or so,
uh, drawn into that, think about this.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.500
Have you ever seen people,
maybe you're one of these people

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.130
that's, uh, taken selfies, right?

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.680
Uh, this is a selfie culture.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:58.560
Like some of you guys are like,
yeah, some of you have speed birth.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.800
And, uh, it is like I have, uh,
three daughters and a son, two

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.150
of my daughters are teenagers.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.960
And so I get.

00:08:07.724 --> 00:08:12.284
It's uh, selfie sometimes, uh, my phone
and pictures are connected to their

00:08:12.284 --> 00:08:14.054
phones and sometimes it's overwhelmed.

00:08:14.054 --> 00:08:17.114
I'm like, how many pictures
of your face do we need?

00:08:17.265 --> 00:08:23.205
Uh, so, uh,  sometimes they look on my
phone and there's pictures of my face.

00:08:23.205 --> 00:08:24.405
You know, they're like, dad, what is this?

00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:25.695
I was like, nah, don't worry about it.

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:28.875
Um, so, uh, but here's the thing.

00:08:29.295 --> 00:08:31.005
We use these platforms.

00:08:31.095 --> 00:08:34.485
Uh, we use social media things
to, to really promote ourself.

00:08:34.605 --> 00:08:36.765
And I don't know if you realize
this, but our culture is

00:08:36.765 --> 00:08:38.445
absolutely obsessed with pitchers.

00:08:39.164 --> 00:08:42.825
We obsessed with, uh, pitchers
way more than what people realize.

00:08:43.125 --> 00:08:48.135
Uh, it takes in these days, human
beings on the planet earth take almost

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:53.565
1 trillion photos a year, 1 trillion
photos a year to put that in context

00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:57.855
as more photos, every few minutes
than the entirety of the 19th century.

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:02.865
If you took the whole 19th century and
you could tally the photos taken during

00:09:02.865 --> 00:09:07.605
that time, we blow that out of the water
in just a few minutes in today's society.

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:10.185
Like, I don't even know
what to do with my photos.

00:09:10.185 --> 00:09:13.125
I'm at a room on my phone and I'm
like, I don't know what to do.

00:09:13.574 --> 00:09:17.564
Should I pay $10 a month so I
could take more photos and have

00:09:17.564 --> 00:09:18.975
more cloud space on my phone.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:21.645
Some of you know, what I'm talking
about, or we have that miserable

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:22.844
experience when we get a new.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.630
And the new phone doesn't have because
of the program and the software on

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.579
that phone, it takes up more data.

00:09:29.584 --> 00:09:31.979
And, but we can't get everything
from our old phone to the new phone,

00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:33.329
and then we gotta make decisions.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.780
What's one of these photos,
what am I gonna get rid of?

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.280
It's a problem.

00:09:38.969 --> 00:09:45.300
We, before I finished speaking
today, 300 million Instagram photos

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.609
will be of up uploaded 300 million.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.280
Uh, I don't know why.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.500
This is where we are as a culture.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.280
But one thing I've realized when
you kind of survey this is we

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.200
have an example in front of us.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.790
That's, that's glaring at us that
we are obsessed with ourself.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:11.610
We are obsessed with self and we, we
dive in and we tap into things that give

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.850
us opportunities to indulge ourself.

00:10:15.645 --> 00:10:17.505
and, uh, I don't think it's a bad thing.

00:10:17.505 --> 00:10:19.485
If you take selfies, like I, that's fine.

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:20.324
You can take selfies.

00:10:20.324 --> 00:10:21.885
I'm not trying to throw you under the bus.

00:10:22.064 --> 00:10:27.074
I take selfies too, but our culture is so
different than what it was 20 years ago.

00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:30.944
And I would argue that it's so different
than what it was 10 years ago, but one

00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:37.454
thing has stayed the cha the one thing
has stayed the same as people want

00:10:37.454 --> 00:10:41.045
to feel valued, want to be accepted.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.110
But they're trying to do that
by accomplishing things through

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.390
themselves for themselves.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.990
See, here's a problem, Christianity
isn't about finding and accepting

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:02.190
yourself or discovering who you are or
finding your value or, or embracing who

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:07.020
you are by the perspectives of other
people, uh, or building a following.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.870
Christianity is actually
about losing yourself.

00:11:11.175 --> 00:11:16.125
it's about giving up who you are and
accepting who Christ says you are.

00:11:16.334 --> 00:11:21.135
It's about accepting and the value
that God has given you already

00:11:21.165 --> 00:11:26.145
in Christ and not worrying or not
looking for that in anywhere else.

00:11:26.295 --> 00:11:27.765
It's about following.

00:11:27.765 --> 00:11:29.204
It's not about who we're following.

00:11:29.235 --> 00:11:30.015
It's about.

00:11:30.345 --> 00:11:31.875
It's not about who's following us.

00:11:31.905 --> 00:11:37.095
It's about who we are following Jesus
boldly, proclaims that Christianity.

00:11:37.515 --> 00:11:39.135
Is about losing yourself.

00:11:39.345 --> 00:11:42.765
So we're gonna look here at this
passage, Matthew 16, if you have your

00:11:42.765 --> 00:11:46.755
Bibles, you can turn Matthew 1621,
and we're gonna see that Jesus is

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.944
teaching some pretty radical statements.

00:11:48.944 --> 00:11:51.555
Our, our introduction
slide was radical rabbi.

00:11:51.885 --> 00:11:57.105
Um, he had some really radical teachings
and this has been for me, this, this verse

00:11:57.105 --> 00:12:02.265
that we're gonna kind of camp out on, uh,
when Jesus says, if you come follow me in

00:12:02.265 --> 00:12:04.905
verse 24, this has become my life verse.

00:12:05.415 --> 00:12:09.165
And it's been a verse that if
you're at my church and student

00:12:09.165 --> 00:12:10.845
ministry is on the t-shirt, it's on.

00:12:10.995 --> 00:12:13.995
If I sign my name in your
card, I sign this verse.

00:12:13.995 --> 00:12:17.565
And I usually use Luke 9 23
because it's actually in all the

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.665
gospels and different variations.

00:12:19.965 --> 00:12:20.205
Uh, but.

00:12:20.875 --> 00:12:24.625
Um, this has been such an important
verse to me because it was as a, as

00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:27.895
a new believer who didn't have any
church background, any context of

00:12:27.895 --> 00:12:29.935
what it meant to really follow Christ.

00:12:29.935 --> 00:12:33.085
I was really confused by what people
were doing and what people were

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:35.935
saying and how it looked for this
person, how it looked for this person.

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:40.585
And so when I got down to the nitty
gritty of who it, who it was, uh, what

00:12:40.585 --> 00:12:44.875
Jesus was saying, this verse became
just that, that, that beacon of.

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.025
It gave me direction.

00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:49.905
Uh, and it helped me to find
my purpose as a follower of

00:12:49.905 --> 00:12:51.105
Christ, what it really meant.

00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:55.455
So couple things leading up
to this is, uh, Matthew 16.

00:12:55.995 --> 00:13:03.225
Uh, Peter, one of Jesus' disciples, uh,
is, is, is being basically praised because

00:13:03.225 --> 00:13:05.085
Jesus is who do people say that I am.

00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:07.215
And, and Peter's like,
you're, you're the Messiah.

00:13:07.215 --> 00:13:08.265
You're the son of God.

00:13:08.415 --> 00:13:09.945
And Jesus is like, man, bless it.

00:13:09.945 --> 00:13:10.545
Are you Peter?

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.590
this has been revealed to
you by my father in heaven.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.950
Bless it.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.270
Or you all right.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:20.460
So we're getting into this next
verse where immediately Jesus says,

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.590
listen, guys, I'm about to die.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.980
Some things are about to happen
and I'm gonna give my life.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.710
And Peter immediately
jumps up and says no way.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.700
So Jesus goes from like, bless it.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.170
Are you Peter?

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.840
Like you're the devil now get behind me.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:33.930
Sat.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.790
And it's like all in this one
transition, and I don't know about

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.090
you, but I have kids and I can just
imagine the other disciples were

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.430
like, Ooh, let's see what happens.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.440
Like Peter just went from being like, he's
the best disciple then Jesus just called

00:13:49.445 --> 00:13:52.140
him the devil, like this is extreme.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:52.620
Right.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:58.620
Uh, and then, so in response to that,
Jesus kinda lays down the groundwork.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.160
If you're gonna follow
me, , this is what you gotta do.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.170
And so let's look at
this passage, verse 21.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.520
From that time on Jesus began to
explain his to his disciples, that

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.630
he must go to Jerusalem and he must
suffer many things at the hands of the

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.770
elders, chief priest and teachers of
the law, and then he must be killed.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.870
And on the third day be raised to life.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.500
Peter took him aside, began
to rebuke him, never Lord.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.300
He said, this shall never happen to.

00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:28.995
Jesus turned and said to Peter,
get behind me, Satan, you

00:14:28.995 --> 00:14:30.255
are a stomaching block to me.

00:14:30.734 --> 00:14:34.785
You do not have in mind the things
of God, but the things of men.

00:14:34.964 --> 00:14:39.135
So here we see that Jesus is, is
rebuking Peter and correcting him.

00:14:39.584 --> 00:14:39.824
All right.

00:14:39.824 --> 00:14:41.204
So he lays the groundwork.

00:14:41.204 --> 00:14:45.165
He says, listen, Peter, you
can't that last verse there, 23,

00:14:45.765 --> 00:14:49.334
you're a stumbling block to me
because you have the mind in mind.

00:14:49.334 --> 00:14:53.745
The thing, not the things of
God, but the things of men.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:00.150
If you want to be a disciple,
look at verse 24, verse 24.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.740
Then Jesus said to his disciples,
if anyone would come after me,

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:10.650
if anyone's gonna come after me,
he must deny himself, take up his

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:15.300
cross and follow me for whoever
wants to save his life will lose it.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.150
But whoever loses his
life for me will find.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.780
What good will it be for a man if
he gains the whole world yet for

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:26.099
forfeit his soul, or what can a
man give an exchange for his soul?

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:30.030
For the son, a man's going to come in
his father's glory with his angels,

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:34.140
and then he will reward each person
according to what he has done.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:42.599
So Jesus is turning this and he says,
listen, Peter, you are blessed because God

00:15:42.599 --> 00:15:44.819
has revealed to you that I am the Messiah.

00:15:44.849 --> 00:15:47.370
You believe that you're blessed, Peter.

00:15:47.939 --> 00:15:51.990
But if you just go and you try to do
this thing called Christianity, if

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.560
you try to do this thing of called
following Jesus in your own way,

00:15:56.339 --> 00:16:00.300
you're like Satan, you're gonna be a
stumbling block to what I want to do.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.560
And what's necessary.

00:16:02.459 --> 00:16:08.729
See, being a Christian, being a follower
Christ is about following Jesus.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.939
If you're not following Jesus,
it's hard to associate and

00:16:11.939 --> 00:16:12.930
call yourself a Christian.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:13.260
Right.

00:16:13.709 --> 00:16:15.839
You can say, I go to church
and, and all kind of things.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.560
So, what we're gonna do is we're
gonna camp out on verse 24.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.160
And I wanna break that down because
in glance you could say, Hey, that's

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.330
pretty, that's pretty awesome.

00:16:24.335 --> 00:16:27.120
Like you gotta deny yourself, take
up your cross and just follow him.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:27.930
That's amazing.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.240
But I, what I've learned over the years
is I've studied this and just I've repeat

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.360
this to myself on a weekly basis at times.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.250
And I've learned that there's so
much more to that it's so deep, so

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.650
complex, so simple at the same time.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.780
And that sometimes we miss just the
most obvious, most direct statements of

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.880
what it really means to follow Christ.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.290
So I wanna walk us through that.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.530
The first one is deny
yourself at the surface.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:59.100
It sounds fine because we probably
all have denied ourselves.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:03.540
Some something, maybe, maybe you drove
by flubs last night and you saw that

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:08.370
line and you was like, Ooh, I don't know,
like that strawberry cheesecake, uh,

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.050
what's those things called those mixer.

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:10.470
Uh, what.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:10.920
Cyclone.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:12.270
Okay.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:12.690
There we go.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.380
Strawberry.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.099
That's what I got.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.089
That thing was amazing.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:16.170
I'm I want another one.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:21.270
So, uh, the strawberry cheesecake cyclone,
maybe that's your go-to you have this

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.760
desire, but you like, ah, it's too late.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.710
I don't know if I got five extra dollars.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.410
Ah, I'm just gonna say no to myself.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.490
I'm gonna deny myself and you drive on
or maybe you're like, you know, I really

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:34.380
haven't been doing well with my eating.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.050
And being healthy and things like that.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.870
So I'm gonna deny myself that
chocolate cake that I want.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.780
I'm gonna deny myself going to skyline.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.970
Uh, we went there with our team.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.110
Uh, it was incredible.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:46.980
Love that chili.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:52.950
Um, anyways, uh  but Jesus is
talking about so much more than that.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.240
If you go to the context of this
passage and you really camp out and

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:02.295
look at what he's saying, , he's not
just saying, say no to your favorite

00:18:02.295 --> 00:18:05.055
drinks or soft drinks or chocolate cake.

00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:10.485
This idea of denying yourself that Jesus
is talking about is a radical concept.

00:18:11.085 --> 00:18:15.555
He is talking about turning away
from the idolatry of self worship.

00:18:17.235 --> 00:18:20.625
Now, listen, this is the, this is,
this is who we are as a culture.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.280
Our culture is built.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.230
The foundation of who we are in
this culture is to worship ourself.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:33.030
It's, it's really the foundation of who
we are as sinful people in, in general.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.580
It is where the sin in the garden.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.530
It was all it all started about.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.970
It was with self.

00:18:39.629 --> 00:18:43.770
So I, I found some quotes of some
very wise people in this culture

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:47.639
who I think represent our culture,
uh, and what our culture stands for.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.649
Uh, this is Ellen DeGeneres.

00:18:50.775 --> 00:18:57.415
And it says, uh, find out who you are
and be that person that's your soul.

00:18:58.395 --> 00:19:03.015
That's what your soul was put on this
earth to be, find that truth, live that

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.295
truth and everything else will come.

00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:09.525
Now here's another wise person
that's speaking to culture.

00:19:09.525 --> 00:19:10.455
Taylor swift.

00:19:11.865 --> 00:19:12.915
Just be yourself.

00:19:13.605 --> 00:19:14.715
There's no one better.

00:19:16.215 --> 00:19:19.665
When you look at Taylor and Ellen,
nobody's like, you know, they're,

00:19:19.665 --> 00:19:21.345
they're not really philosophers.

00:19:21.855 --> 00:19:25.034
And these statements that they're
saying they're applauded so much in

00:19:25.034 --> 00:19:27.195
our culture, like, yeah, that is true.

00:19:27.195 --> 00:19:28.215
That is that's right.

00:19:28.215 --> 00:19:28.935
Just be yourself.

00:19:28.935 --> 00:19:29.534
Nobody else.

00:19:29.534 --> 00:19:30.465
There's no one better.

00:19:30.465 --> 00:19:34.365
Or just look at your heart,
whatever you de, oh, excuse me,

00:19:34.485 --> 00:19:36.825
whatever you desire, go and do it.

00:19:37.004 --> 00:19:38.595
That is what it's all about.

00:19:38.655 --> 00:19:41.665
And, and, and, and, but
here, Ellen and Taylor.

00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:45.044
, they're not like super wise philosophers.

00:19:45.044 --> 00:19:50.205
They're just regurgitating what
our culture believes and it, when

00:19:50.205 --> 00:19:55.185
you hear it, like for me, and
maybe for you, it sounds right.

00:19:55.905 --> 00:19:59.115
Because most of everybody,
we come in contact with says,

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.764
this is what life is about.

00:20:01.125 --> 00:20:04.245
Ralph WATO Emerson, I
think was very honest.

00:20:04.845 --> 00:20:05.725
He wasn't a believer.

00:20:06.284 --> 00:20:07.514
This is the way he said it.

00:20:08.175 --> 00:20:10.845
I will not hide my taste or versions.

00:20:11.595 --> 00:20:11.895
I will.

00:20:11.895 --> 00:20:17.805
So trust that what is deep is holy
that I will do strongly before the sun

00:20:17.805 --> 00:20:22.455
and the moon, whatever only rejoices
me and what the heart appoints.

00:20:22.725 --> 00:20:29.625
Ralph Waldo, Emerson, man, this
sounds right, but here's the problem.

00:20:30.254 --> 00:20:35.685
When you take this philosophy and
you take this idea of our culture

00:20:35.835 --> 00:20:40.305
and you compare it to what Christ
says, it is the polar opposite.

00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:47.325
See Jesus says that if you're going to
follow me the first thing you must, if

00:20:47.325 --> 00:20:52.095
you're writing your Bibles, underline
that word must you must deny yourself.

00:20:52.695 --> 00:20:55.395
That means you must stop worshiping self.

00:20:55.695 --> 00:20:59.754
You must lay down your
own, will your own desires.

00:21:00.105 --> 00:21:03.254
We, we we've come to the understanding
as followers of Christ, that

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.605
our nature is not something
that we can trust or embrace.

00:21:07.605 --> 00:21:10.575
Jeremiah tells us that our
heart is deceitful and that

00:21:10.575 --> 00:21:12.315
we must not just embrace it.

00:21:12.495 --> 00:21:16.425
God tells us an zeal that he will
put a new heart inside of you.

00:21:17.054 --> 00:21:20.324
That new heart he'll take out
that star, that heart of stone.

00:21:20.324 --> 00:21:24.615
He'll replace it with a heart with his,
his law, his commandments written on it.

00:21:24.615 --> 00:21:27.044
A desire to please and honor him.

00:21:27.254 --> 00:21:30.794
See when you are a Christian,
you are a follower of Christ.

00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:33.485
We are not living our own life.

00:21:34.304 --> 00:21:36.284
We're laying our lives down.

00:21:36.645 --> 00:21:40.185
We're submitting our bodies, as it
would say, Romans 12 as a living S.

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:44.264
And we're saying, God, here I am.

00:21:44.774 --> 00:21:45.824
Take me Christ.

00:21:46.185 --> 00:21:51.794
L Paul said, it's not I that live,
but Christ that live in me, we

00:21:51.794 --> 00:21:54.225
can't just embrace who we are.

00:21:55.304 --> 00:21:55.725
Jesus.

00:21:55.725 --> 00:22:00.165
Isn't asking us to do something that he
hasn't already done, or he hasn't modeled.

00:22:00.614 --> 00:22:03.645
John 6 38 says this Jesus speaking.

00:22:03.645 --> 00:22:09.074
He says, boy, I've come down from
having not to do my will, but to

00:22:09.074 --> 00:22:10.844
do the will of him who sent me.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:13.410
in Philippians.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:18.480
Paul is speaking to the church of Philippi
and he's talking to other believers

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.030
and he says the same attitude and
mindset that Jesus had you should have.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:25.020
And this is what he said.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.220
He says, your attitude should be
the same as that of Christ Jesus,

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.350
who being in the very nature.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:36.450
God did not consider equality with
God, something to be grasped, but

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.600
made himself nothing by taking
the very nature of a servant.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.070
Being made in human likeness and
being found in appearance as a man,

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:48.210
he humbled himself and became obedient
to death, even death on a cross

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.060
self, self denial, denying yourself.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:52.530
Isn't a recommendation.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.630
It's a re requirement.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.050
It's a, it's a prerequisite
to following Christ.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:03.840
Jesus said, if anyone desires to follow
me, they must first deny themself.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.850
This means we have to be
willing to lay our lives down.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.860
And surrender that under the Lordship,
the kingship of who Jesus is.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.660
Many times people kind of live
their life as, as in, if there was

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.430
in their heart, there's a bench.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:24.150
And, and like, uh, you know, you're
playing basketball and like, you

00:23:24.155 --> 00:23:27.000
have a chair and you're like, Hey,
come sit down beside me, buddy.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:31.590
Jesus doesn't want to come
sit on a bench in your heart.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:37.740
In fact, he won't, I, I like to think of
this idea that our heart there's a throne.

00:23:38.925 --> 00:23:44.955
Neither you are sitting on that throne
ruling your life, or if you're a

00:23:44.955 --> 00:23:49.844
follower of Christ, you get off of
that throne and you kneel and you

00:23:49.844 --> 00:23:54.945
allow Jesus to sit on the throne of
your life and you submit, listen, it

00:23:54.949 --> 00:23:56.925
affects all aspects of who you are.

00:23:57.719 --> 00:24:00.750
It's not something that just shows up
on a Sunday morning or shows up when

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.790
you're around your pastor or your church.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:06.689
People it's like you can't help it
because when you've surrendered to

00:24:06.689 --> 00:24:11.550
Christ and you're denying yourself,
Jesus is the king of the Kings.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.830
He's, he's the king over your life.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.580
He's calling the shots.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.699
He's the boss.

00:24:18.929 --> 00:24:23.879
And when he's calling the shots, there's
a, there's a response, a responsibility

00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:26.250
that we have to say, yes, Lord.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:26.429
Right?

00:24:27.165 --> 00:24:28.905
Because we understand who he is.

00:24:28.905 --> 00:24:30.584
He's not just a nice guy.

00:24:30.675 --> 00:24:33.945
Listen, if Jesus is just a nice guy
and a great teacher, we're all wasting

00:24:33.945 --> 00:24:37.395
our time, but he's not he's God.

00:24:38.534 --> 00:24:43.514
And, but because of who he is, he
has the authority and he deserves

00:24:43.574 --> 00:24:45.345
the authority of, of our life.

00:24:45.345 --> 00:24:51.254
And we give it to him by denying
ourselves, we lay our lives down.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:58.980
We give up everything, our ambitions, our
desires, our dreams, our plans, oh man.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:24:59.730
We're Americans.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:00.840
We gotta have a plan.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.129
Right.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.139
We gotta have a plan.

00:25:04.139 --> 00:25:05.129
It's got our plan.

00:25:05.129 --> 00:25:08.189
We have to have a plan for our
plan so that we can have a plan.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.330
Some of y'all are laughing cuz you're
that kind of per that kind of person.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.970
I am just a little bit okay.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:18.720
If I'm just being confessional
here, but we are self dependent.

00:25:19.649 --> 00:25:25.500
self resilient, self pursuing, and we
have to give up those character traits.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:31.860
Any attempt at discipleship does
that does not involve renouncing full

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:39.030
autonomy and self love is not an actual
attempt to follow Jesus meaningfully.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.730
When you follow Jesus, you
walk away from yourself.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.280
We make him a master.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.129
First, we must remove
ourselves from that position.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:55.830
This example is throughout the entirety
of scripture, when you look at the

00:25:55.830 --> 00:26:00.000
new Testament, every gospel, every,
uh, letter written to the church,

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:05.970
there's, there's undertones of this self
denial, giving up, turning away, laying

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.180
down, uh, it's all throughout here.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.370
And we, a lot of times, as me as an
American, I just can glaze over that.

00:26:14.729 --> 00:26:18.300
Because that does, that's not
compatible with my nature.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.310
Right.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.530
Which is why the next part
of this is really important.

00:26:22.949 --> 00:26:25.530
Jesus said, the second thing you
must do is take up your cross.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:29.909
Now I'm the type of person I would, I
don't have a cross necklace on, but I

00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:31.620
definitely would wear a cross necklace.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:36.030
I would have a cross t-shirt when I got
saved and, and I started going to college.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.370
I was kind of weird and I was this guy.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:39.840
I made some Jesus pants.

00:26:40.395 --> 00:26:40.845
All right.

00:26:41.115 --> 00:26:44.595
And so my Jesus pants, like I took a
cross and I painted a big cross on my

00:26:44.595 --> 00:26:49.305
leg and I just up and down every leg,
I wrote Bible verses and put Jesus

00:26:49.305 --> 00:26:51.885
fish and king of Kings, Lord of Lords.

00:26:52.095 --> 00:26:53.775
And I would wear 'em to college.

00:26:53.925 --> 00:26:57.195
And my professors, I had
professors that called me weird.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.360
Mean names in front of the whole class.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.960
Uh, they would like distinctive,
like instinctively, like question

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.700
me on my positions of stuff.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.800
I guess I was like a target, you
know, I was like making a target

00:27:07.805 --> 00:27:10.050
on myself, but it was interesting.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.080
Uh, so I'm not against crosses.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.560
I'm not against those kind of
logos and ideas, but I think

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.360
sometimes when we read this to us,
the cross is a beautiful image.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.920
it represents God's grace and his
mercy and his forgiveness, right.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:26.670
To us.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.160
We cherish that to the people.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.550
Jesus is speaking to in this
passage, it's a horrific image.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.150
It would be like, it would be
like wearing a noose around your

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:39.600
neck, walking around, like, like,
look how beautiful this noose is.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.830
People would be like, that's horrific.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.360
Why would you put that on your neck?

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.070
That's what it's like.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.320
Jesus says, take up your cross.

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:47.940
It has that same connotation.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:52.140
Of it, it would be like saying,
Hey, come Lynch yourself.

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:53.370
It'd like, no, what?

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:54.900
That's bogus.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.650
That's weird.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.850
That's radical.

00:27:56.855 --> 00:28:02.850
No, that's, uh, absurd in Jesus'
day across was a disgusting thing.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.920
It represented crucifixion.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.320
In fact, in the public circle, it
was frowned upon to even use the word

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.870
crucifixion or terms it was seen as VUL.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:15.330
Like almost like cussing.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.080
All right.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.530
Uh, so it, it was horrific, it was cruel.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:26.580
The Roman empire used the cross as a
symbol of, of crucifixion when people

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.890
were criminalized or, or criminals.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.130
And it was, it was a, it
was a symbol of execution.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.440
Now, listen, it wasn't just a method.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.220
It was, it was also a, a
persuasion of intimidation.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:43.365
You know, it was like the Roman government
was like, if you go against us,  yeah.

00:28:43.395 --> 00:28:49.515
See this cross as you buddy, you come
against us, you go against the system,

00:28:49.755 --> 00:28:52.215
you try to rebel, you try to overthrow us.

00:28:52.335 --> 00:28:54.735
Here's what's waiting on you as his cross.

00:28:55.065 --> 00:28:56.895
And Jesus is speaking to his followers.

00:28:56.895 --> 00:28:59.565
He's saying, Hey, come take up your cross.

00:29:00.825 --> 00:29:04.125
That image that was in their
mind is much different than the

00:29:04.125 --> 00:29:05.775
one that comes to mind for us.

00:29:06.285 --> 00:29:09.765
Thankfully, Jesus, isn't
asking his followers.

00:29:10.335 --> 00:29:13.065
To come die by execution though.

00:29:13.065 --> 00:29:17.534
There are many people around the world
who do die because of their faith

00:29:18.435 --> 00:29:20.145
because of their obedience to Christ.

00:29:21.135 --> 00:29:28.485
Jesus is talking about dying to yourself,
a radical dying of self-centered living.

00:29:29.295 --> 00:29:33.014
The other parts of scripture
would say, crucify yourself,

00:29:33.495 --> 00:29:36.675
Galatians 5 24, Galatians five 20.

00:29:37.245 --> 00:29:40.725
Um, is you're maybe familiar
with the fruits of the spirit

00:29:41.655 --> 00:29:42.764
at the end of that passage.

00:29:43.575 --> 00:29:45.705
Uh, apostle Paul talks about this.

00:29:46.064 --> 00:29:53.024
He says those who belong to Jesus
have crucified the sinful nature

00:29:53.534 --> 00:30:01.254
with its passions and desires, same
imagery, those who follow Jesus

00:30:02.054 --> 00:30:04.215
are those who deny themselves.

00:30:04.889 --> 00:30:08.129
Who are crucifying our sinful nature.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.770
Now, can I be a, can I
just be honest with you?

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:15.330
Like, there's a lot of things I don't
like about myself that I wish were

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:20.430
different and then my own power in my own
strength, I have no ability to change it.

00:30:21.659 --> 00:30:22.770
I'll give you an example.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.850
I struggle with depression,
uh, and, uh, I hate that.

00:30:27.449 --> 00:30:29.610
It's like a thorn in my
flesh, you know what I mean?

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:30.750
Like, I don't want it to be there.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:31.020
I don't.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.470
And it's like, I used to think
like, well, maybe I'm a pastor, you

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:35.600
know, maybe I get more spiritual.

00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:38.040
If I just read my Bible more,
pray more and go to church more.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.879
This will go away.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.280
Well, it didn't, and it hasn't, it
doesn't overcome my life, but it's there

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.350
at times and I have to deal with it.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:48.070
It's a, a thorn in my flesh.

00:30:49.439 --> 00:30:52.320
Uh, I've struggled with other sins.

00:30:52.665 --> 00:30:54.105
Not that depression's not a sin.

00:30:54.135 --> 00:30:54.945
I don't believe that.

00:30:54.945 --> 00:30:55.725
Let me clarify that.

00:30:57.195 --> 00:30:58.635
I struggle with other sins though.

00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:01.785
Things that are, that I
wish were not in my life.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:08.115
I have a, a bad habit of having a negative
attitude where I'm just like, I grew

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.095
up in a home where it was all negative.

00:31:10.455 --> 00:31:13.305
And so I have this, sometimes
this sinful disposition, like

00:31:13.305 --> 00:31:14.385
when things are not going, right.

00:31:14.385 --> 00:31:17.145
I just go into this funk where
I'm just like, wait, wait, wait,

00:31:17.145 --> 00:31:19.035
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:31:19.095 --> 00:31:20.445
You know, like it's just like my.

00:31:21.705 --> 00:31:22.965
That's my sin nature.

00:31:23.955 --> 00:31:30.074
If I don't lay down my life daily
to Jesus Christ, that's who you get.

00:31:31.185 --> 00:31:33.135
My kids have seen that person at times.

00:31:33.139 --> 00:31:37.125
My wife, my pastor has seen that guy
sometimes showing up to staff, meeting.

00:31:37.905 --> 00:31:43.754
Maybe other people in this room have seen
that I'm a human being and just like you,

00:31:43.845 --> 00:31:47.655
I have to lay down my life, deny myself.

00:31:48.195 --> 00:31:52.865
And allow the power of Jesus
that lives in me as a believer.

00:31:53.535 --> 00:31:58.695
The Bible tells us greater as he, that
is in me, in me than he is in this world.

00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:04.275
And I have to allow that holy spirit
power to crucify my sin nature.

00:32:04.575 --> 00:32:06.705
What does he say daily?

00:32:07.515 --> 00:32:08.685
Take up your cross daily.

00:32:09.524 --> 00:32:10.635
Gotta crucify it.

00:32:10.784 --> 00:32:15.165
If I, if I fall behind or I'm
not being, uh, subject to Jesus

00:32:15.165 --> 00:32:17.024
in that way, it will show up.

00:32:17.024 --> 00:32:20.235
It will rear its ugly head
up in my life and it will be

00:32:20.235 --> 00:32:22.095
noticeable to me and to others.

00:32:23.175 --> 00:32:29.925
It's important to follow Christ when we
are doing that, we're making ourselves

00:32:30.225 --> 00:32:32.925
subject to rejection and ridicule.

00:32:33.764 --> 00:32:38.985
Another part of the cross was it was
a public demonstration for the Romans.

00:32:38.985 --> 00:32:44.985
It was a public execution, but to
follow Christ is a public call to put

00:32:44.985 --> 00:32:46.905
your life and your faith on display.

00:32:47.774 --> 00:32:52.245
When, when people would carry their
cross, they would be walking through town.

00:32:52.514 --> 00:32:53.595
Their bodies had been beaten.

00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:55.245
Their clothes would be
stripped off of them.

00:32:55.335 --> 00:32:57.254
They were being mocked and ridiculed.

00:32:57.405 --> 00:33:00.675
People were stepping back to take
notice and the busyness of the

00:33:00.675 --> 00:33:02.985
day they would stop and watch.

00:33:03.735 --> 00:33:05.195
It was a spectacle.

00:33:05.445 --> 00:33:11.235
It was a display of the Roman government's
power and their authority and their

00:33:11.235 --> 00:33:16.215
horrific, uh, the, the, the things
they would do to, to, to secure that.

00:33:17.475 --> 00:33:21.695
And Jesus is saying, if you're gonna
follow me, you must deny yourself.

00:33:22.095 --> 00:33:24.465
You must be willing to crucify your flesh.

00:33:24.525 --> 00:33:28.155
And I want you to understand that part
of that call to take up your cross

00:33:28.155 --> 00:33:30.795
daily is to live your life publicly for.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:36.120
Is publicly not privately publicly.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.220
It is so important.

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:40.680
Now let me clarify that.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:45.870
I do not believe that this idea of
taking up your cross is a method or

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.670
way where you're saving yourself.

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:49.260
No, no, no, no, no.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.100
Hear me out.

00:33:50.105 --> 00:33:50.520
Okay.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:56.670
Taking up your cross is, is really
an act of obedience and love because

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.100
Jesus took up his cross to save.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:08.730
see, he did it first and those who follow
Christ, basically we love the Lord.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:11.850
We love God because he first loved us.

00:34:13.259 --> 00:34:17.190
And when you've experienced that
grace and forgiveness that, that

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:21.389
natural retaliation or that natural
next step is to love him back.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.810
Right?

00:34:22.259 --> 00:34:24.870
It's like you've experienced
God's forgiveness in your life

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.400
when you know what you deserve.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.889
And he withholds that from you.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:32.129
Or God blesses you in spite of your
sin and what you struggle with and what

00:34:32.129 --> 00:34:35.009
you've dealt with that is who God is.

00:34:35.009 --> 00:34:39.419
That's his character and what God
loves with this unconditional love.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.819
We get to love him back.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:48.750
And how do we love him back with
the, by following him, by being

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:52.229
obedient to him, by having a desire
that doesn't mean you're perfect

00:34:52.229 --> 00:34:53.310
that you won't make mistakes.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.969
No, you will.

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:57.089
I do  trust me, but it means.

00:34:58.035 --> 00:35:01.965
That we will have a desire to go for it.

00:35:02.625 --> 00:35:06.255
Many people claim Christ through
a commitment to social justice

00:35:06.255 --> 00:35:09.855
or moral uprightness or positive
feelings in regard to the gospel.

00:35:10.455 --> 00:35:16.515
But when you boil it all down, that's
really, that's really not what it is.

00:35:18.015 --> 00:35:18.465
Claiming.

00:35:18.465 --> 00:35:23.145
Christ is about radically experiencing
the grace and forgiveness of God

00:35:24.945 --> 00:35:26.775
and radically obeying Christ.

00:35:27.615 --> 00:35:29.084
Because we have been set free.

00:35:30.464 --> 00:35:31.875
We've been set free to do that.

00:35:32.895 --> 00:35:35.084
The Bible tells us that
Jesus sets you free.

00:35:35.475 --> 00:35:41.084
He sets you free from your sin in Roman
six, it says you're a slave to sin sins.

00:35:41.089 --> 00:35:44.084
Your master Jesus comes.

00:35:44.115 --> 00:35:45.285
He sets you free.

00:35:46.064 --> 00:35:48.964
Now you're no longer a master to your sin.

00:35:49.544 --> 00:35:50.654
You have a new master.

00:35:50.955 --> 00:35:53.865
If you look at the apostle Paul,
he would call himself a slave of.

00:35:54.795 --> 00:35:59.115
A bond servant to Jesus Christ, all
these titles and things that he would

00:35:59.115 --> 00:36:05.865
use was identifying his position is that
Christ is greater than I, I am under him.

00:36:06.075 --> 00:36:10.725
I am he, I am his servant and there
is nothing in me, nothing about me.

00:36:11.055 --> 00:36:14.355
That that is good without the
work of Jesus Christ, Paul

00:36:14.355 --> 00:36:15.915
boasted about his sin, right?

00:36:15.915 --> 00:36:17.835
He says, I'm the chief sinner.

00:36:18.435 --> 00:36:20.115
I'm the worst of all you guys.

00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:22.305
I've Cru I've, I've killed Christians.

00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:24.105
I've persecuted a church.

00:36:24.705 --> 00:36:28.785
He said, but God's grace, I'm the
chief center, but God's grace covered

00:36:28.785 --> 00:36:31.035
a multitude of sins in my life.

00:36:31.935 --> 00:36:33.075
His love is greater.

00:36:34.154 --> 00:36:36.884
And I want you to know that today,
maybe you hear this and you go, Ooh,

00:36:36.884 --> 00:36:38.355
man, I ain't meeting any of this.

00:36:38.355 --> 00:36:39.884
Like, I'm just like, Ooh, I don't know.

00:36:40.815 --> 00:36:44.985
I don't want you to walk outta here with
this sense of, uh, of dark cloud looming.

00:36:44.985 --> 00:36:48.915
I want you to hear the hope of this is
that Jesus is just saying surrender to.

00:36:51.435 --> 00:36:55.425
there's no work that you have to
do other than inviting him into

00:36:55.425 --> 00:37:01.155
your heart and saying I'm yours
and giving over surrendering, quit

00:37:01.155 --> 00:37:02.775
fighting your own battle, right?

00:37:02.835 --> 00:37:06.345
Raise that white flag in your heart
and say, I surrender to king Jesus.

00:37:07.815 --> 00:37:11.685
There's no external works that
you have to perform or do before

00:37:11.685 --> 00:37:13.005
God will show up in your life.

00:37:13.155 --> 00:37:15.825
Really it's about just
giving up and allowing.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.680
to sit on the throne of your life.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.790
Just get out of the
way and let God be God.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.360
And you take you take the sidekick rail.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:30.690
That's what Jesus is calling us too.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:36.630
If we believe that we believe
as Christ would say that we

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.720
die to live, we die to live.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.850
Jesus said in John chapter 12.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.550
And, uh, we're gonna be closing
up here in just a second.

00:37:45.105 --> 00:37:47.385
He said the hour has come for
the Sunman to be glorified.

00:37:47.655 --> 00:37:48.615
I tell you the truth.

00:37:48.645 --> 00:37:50.895
Unless a Colonel wheat falls
to the ground and dies.

00:37:51.105 --> 00:37:55.215
It remains only a single seed, but
if it dies, it produces many seeds.

00:37:55.395 --> 00:37:57.435
The man who loves his life will lose it.

00:37:57.435 --> 00:38:01.815
And the man who hates his life, uh, in
this world will keep it for eternal life.

00:38:02.145 --> 00:38:06.555
Whoever serves me must
follow me and where I am.

00:38:06.585 --> 00:38:09.465
My servant also will be my father.

00:38:09.525 --> 00:38:10.845
My father will honor.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:17.730
The one who serves me listening
in God's economy to gain is

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:21.720
to first lose in this economy.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:26.640
It's get what you can get while you can
get it because the getting's getting gone.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.370
Y'all made, that's a common
Southern kind of thing.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:34.859
So sorry if that was you better
get it while you can get it.

00:38:34.859 --> 00:38:37.350
Cause the GI getting good and
getting, getting gone, like.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.300
you better get it.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:43.670
It's about acquiring what
you can while you can.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.590
How many of you guys remember
the toilet paper crisis?

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:49.230
We had, that's an example.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.940
You better get it when you get it.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.940
People were like texting, go
to Sam's now go to Sam's club.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.190
Now I saw a truck pull in.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:59.130
I swear there was toilet paper
on their truck go to Sam's now.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:05.220
And people were like, you know, It's not
a, that's not what following Christ is.

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.870
That's not what the
kingdom of God is about.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:11.070
The kingdom of God is this guys
listen over and over and over again.

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:14.730
Jesus explains this through
parables and his teachings.

00:39:14.735 --> 00:39:18.210
It's in the, every gospel it's
in every book in the Bible.

00:39:18.215 --> 00:39:24.210
Just about this concept of when you lay
down, when you give up, you give you

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:29.940
sacrifice, you commit, you surrender
from the viewpoint of this world.

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:30.840
You are losing.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.290
But God says, I don't think so.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:40.950
From his perspective, you just laid
the groundwork for him to show up

00:39:41.009 --> 00:39:44.310
and to blow you outta the water,
with what he can do in your life.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.690
As long as you're trying
to live your life.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.640
Why do you think God, God's not gonna
show up and just amaze everybody.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.700
You have to like, say,
God, I can't do this.

00:39:57.569 --> 00:40:00.690
And he says, I know I'm waiting for
you to come to that realization.

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:05.100
To humble yourself, get out of the way.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.690
And let me show you how
mighty, how powerful I am.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.990
That's what surrender means, but in our
Western society, we've lost that concept.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.570
So I wanna ask you a question today.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.270
Do you follow Jesus?

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:29.070
And if you do, have you denied yourself?

00:40:30.345 --> 00:40:35.055
Are you willing to take up your
cross daily and follow him publicly?

00:40:36.134 --> 00:40:39.465
If not, I want to encourage
you today to consider that.

00:40:41.025 --> 00:40:44.175
And maybe you are a
believer and I get this.

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:47.835
Maybe you're a believer and you're like,
oh man, I hadn't really been doing this.

00:40:48.555 --> 00:40:49.755
Hey, I'm a pastor.

00:40:49.845 --> 00:40:53.384
And I have to admit that at
times, like, uh, I hadn't really

00:40:53.384 --> 00:40:54.375
been doing this that great.

00:40:54.975 --> 00:40:56.835
I've been really focused on myself a lot.

00:40:58.065 --> 00:40:58.665
I get it.

00:40:59.055 --> 00:41:01.245
We battle that constantly.

00:41:02.384 --> 00:41:06.825
But the answer to that is still the
same surrender, surrender to Jesus.

00:41:07.935 --> 00:41:08.835
Lay your life down.

00:41:10.785 --> 00:41:13.035
Maybe that's you, maybe you're
here today and you've never

00:41:13.035 --> 00:41:14.685
made that decision period.

00:41:14.984 --> 00:41:15.944
You're like this Jesus.

00:41:15.975 --> 00:41:16.725
Thing's weird.

00:41:16.935 --> 00:41:17.505
I get it.

00:41:17.654 --> 00:41:20.295
I used to think Christians were like,
I was like, dude, they're freaky.

00:41:20.505 --> 00:41:21.734
Like they're weird people.

00:41:22.245 --> 00:41:24.795
Like they're doing these things
and saying things it's like

00:41:24.795 --> 00:41:25.725
almost a different language.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.589
Who says that who's doing that.

00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:29.819
Like I thought it was weird.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:33.930
And I remember as a kid walking
into a church and, and going like,

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:38.370
this is kind of weird and everybody
would bow their heads all at the

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:39.870
same time, all their eyes closed.

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:41.490
And I was like, I ain't closing my eyes.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.819
Like, I don't know, like somebody
and they would pass the plate and I'd

00:41:44.819 --> 00:41:46.350
be like, are they handing out money?

00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:47.490
Or are they putting money in there?

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.950
Like, and they were like,
no, you don't take it.

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:50.759
I was like, oh, okay.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.705
And you know, like,  that's
who I was, but I remember that.

00:41:54.765 --> 00:41:56.865
And maybe you're that kind of person
you're like, man, I don't know.

00:41:56.924 --> 00:42:00.795
Or maybe you've been hurt by
church or hurt by another believer.

00:42:01.455 --> 00:42:05.924
Can I just say something like
we're all sinful people, we all

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:08.895
make mistakes and Christianity.

00:42:08.899 --> 00:42:10.185
Isn't about perfection.

00:42:10.754 --> 00:42:13.274
It's about surrendering our
life to the one who is perfect.

00:42:14.415 --> 00:42:15.315
So I wanna ask our worship team.

00:42:15.315 --> 00:42:18.765
Will you guys come up and I'm
gonna pray if God's leading today,

00:42:19.245 --> 00:42:20.884
I just wanna ask you to respond.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:24.930
Just to say, Hey, I, I wanna pray.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.570
I want, I want a closer walk with God.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:31.950
You know, I wanna, I wanna give
myself to Christ, like you talked

00:42:31.955 --> 00:42:35.820
about today, you can go read that
in mark chapter eight, Luke chapter

00:42:35.825 --> 00:42:38.549
nine, or Matthew 16, John chapter 12.

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:40.560
It's in every gospel.

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.470
Christ is calling us.

00:42:44.279 --> 00:42:46.500
Maybe you're here today and
you need to respond to that.

00:42:46.529 --> 00:42:48.090
You just move as gods sees.

00:42:49.095 --> 00:42:51.825
I'll be standing to the side,
your pastor then to be here.

00:42:51.885 --> 00:42:55.755
If you need to come talk about giving
your life to Christ or taking another

00:42:55.755 --> 00:42:57.945
step in your faith, do it today.

00:43:00.165 --> 00:43:02.325
Father, we just thank you for
your grace and your mercy.

00:43:02.685 --> 00:43:06.795
And I just pray Lord that you would
move as you see F God be honored.

00:43:07.095 --> 00:43:09.045
This is for your glory in Jesus name.

00:43:09.195 --> 00:43:09.675
Amen.
