00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.440
The Lord stood by me, gave me strength
to proclaim the message fully.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.520
Well, good morning everybody.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.640
I hope you guys have, uh, been
staying warm cuz today's cold and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.930
then it's gonna be rainy, uh, this
later this afternoon, evening.

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:29.670
We're supposed to be going
to my son's Super Bowl.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.050
Which is great, but it's supposed
to be raining, which is not great.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.730
So I'm not looking forward to that.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.490
So I'm trying to stay as warm as
possible until we have to get out there.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.320
Um, of course I'll have lots of warm
clothes and they'll be out in the

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:43.620
rain, but I'm worried more about me.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.330
I mean, cuz that's all that matters.

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:45.660
Right?

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.750
Um, if you have your Bibles
with you today, we're gonna be

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.850
in second Timothy chapter two.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.490
Uh, we're gonna read, um, from verses
one through 13, but we covered two weeks.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.510
Um, the first two verses, so we're not
gonna be covering those verses today.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.730
Uh, it will be up on the screen as well.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.910
If you don't have a Bible with you, um, I
encourage you to grab one on the way out.

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:09.480
If you did, do not have a Bible at all or
own one, would love for you to grab that.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.920
If not, download the Bible app.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.180
I'd love for you to do that.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.650
That's something I use daily.

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.729
Um, but before we jump into this
text, something, I want to kinda

00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:18.660
give you an eyes an update.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.479
Um, many of you were here last
week, we had a family meeting.

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.380
Our family meetings are great because it's
an opportunity to just catch up, um, as

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.559
a, as a church, talk about the future,
talk about what God has been doing,

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.210
and encourage you guys on some things.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.820
And so some of you may have heard
or may not have heard, we are

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.740
continuing to look at another space.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.830
We're looking to transition out
and so continue to be praying for.

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:43.390
Space, Um, and talking with the Y
M C A, um, here on the west side.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.750
And so we will see what God
continues to do in opening that door.

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:50.110
Um, but be praying with us cuz
we're hoping in the next month or

00:01:50.115 --> 00:01:51.820
so we'll have some answers on that.

00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:53.710
So really excited about that.

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.280
Um, so as we jump into today's
text, kinda wanna catch you up.

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:00.885
And what's been going on, um, in the text.

00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:05.265
And so what we have learned is this
letter is from the Apostle Paul to

00:02:05.265 --> 00:02:06.884
his true son in the faith Timothy.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.794
And as we begin to talk about this
relationship, and, and you dive a little

00:02:09.794 --> 00:02:14.385
bit deeper, uh, most believe Paul didn't
ever have a son and most believe that

00:02:14.475 --> 00:02:16.575
Timothy's father was not a godly father.

00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:19.275
And so if you look at these two,
it was a perfect match where Paul

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:21.405
fit the role model of a father.

00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:26.895
Um, and Timothy fit the role of a son and
they had a tight, genuine relationship.

00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:32.385
Well, Paul is writing this letter from
prison, um, and most believe this is

00:02:32.635 --> 00:02:34.545
the last imprisonment before his death.

00:02:34.575 --> 00:02:38.865
And so Timothy would know this
letter is coming from, um, a, a

00:02:38.865 --> 00:02:42.225
place of, of what we would say is
a last willing statement, right?

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.536
The last things in which Paul
would share with Timothy Tim.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.459
So that these words are important,
uh, not only for Timothy,

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.810
but I would say even for us.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.500
So I'm hoping that as you, uh,
get, continue to dive into this,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.200
um, week after week, that you
look at these words the same way.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.820
And so we learned that Paul is writing
this letter to give some last words of

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:15.630
wisdom, and we talk about this, What's the
difference between knowledge and wisdom?

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.780
Wisdom is the right
application of knowledge.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.500
Um, and, and I would say this,
that most of us probably know

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.870
more truths than we actually ob.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.310
We follow.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.690
I don't know if maybe you
don't agree with that.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.530
I would agree with that.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.620
I typically know more of what
I should be doing than what

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.359
I actually go out and live.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.870
I remember hearing this statement that
it's not the truths we know, but it's the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.549
truths we obey that make a difference.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.240
And that's really where Paul is getting
at with Timothy is like, Hey, take

00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:43.680
all these truths I've taught you.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.410
And take them and teach them to others.

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:47.940
Live them out boldly.

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:50.519
Um, and I, I'm challenged by
this and I hope that you guys

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:51.239
have been challenged by this.

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.209
So I just wanna kind of catch you
up over the first chapter, Paul

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.170
opened up and he really just showed
his love and care for Timothy.

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:02.325
Uh, and then he reminded Timothy
because, Timothy was forgetful and were

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:07.035
forgetful, and so he reminded Timothy of
his faith and his gift so that Timothy

00:04:07.035 --> 00:04:11.025
would be reminded that God was ready
to use him, that God was gifted him to

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.115
be the leader in the church there and
to be the leader after Paul had left.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:19.605
So after he reminded him that he invited
him to join in on the suffering, we're

00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:21.584
gonna continue that thought today.

00:04:21.914 --> 00:04:25.155
But he invited Timothy at that
moment to join in, in the suffering.

00:04:25.155 --> 00:04:27.255
And, and again, we're gonna
learn more about that.

00:04:27.255 --> 00:04:30.825
But then he challenged him to keep
the truth, the word of God, right?

00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:34.275
The truth, to hold onto
it and to protect it.

00:04:34.905 --> 00:04:37.515
And then he challenged Timothy to
not only to protect that truth,

00:04:37.515 --> 00:04:38.775
but to live that truth out.

00:04:38.775 --> 00:04:41.175
And then last week, he challenged
Timothy to take all that.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.680
To begin to commit it to faithful people,
faithful men who would teach other men

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.040
and faithful people who would teach
other people, and to continue this trend

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.390
to where we are today of so many people
that were faithful to keeping that truth.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.760
That we have the word of God today,
that we have the truth today, that we

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.260
have a church today that now gets to
read about somebody who started this.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.500
Right?

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.420
This is really cool how we see this.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.660
Um, but then now we're going
to jump into this idea behind

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.440
where, where Paul challenges
Timothy to share in the suffering.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.030
And so a question that I already
probably know the answer to here.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.320
Who here enjoys suffering?

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.740
Anybody?

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.960
Hey, we got one back there.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.099
Jonas enjoys suffering.

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.370
So there's always one in the
group that enjoys suffering.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.330
What is suffering?

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.729
Suffering is the state of undergoing
pain, distress and hardship.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.490
The state of undergoing
pain, distress, and hardship.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.690
So who here is ever endured
pain, suffering, and hardship?

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:38.250
Great.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.880
We're all in the same.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.190
See, we all have experienced some form
of suffering in our lives, uh, and most

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.050
of us would say, We don't enjoy that.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.880
But let me just ask this question.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.320
Whoever has in here has endured
suffering, but on the other side

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.030
of that suffering was a reward.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.810
Anybody?

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.000
Okay, a few of you.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.800
What was it?

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.690
What was it again?

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.630
What was that birth of your first child?

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.580
Was that painful for you or your wife?

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.590
Both.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.130
Okay.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.030
It's good Helping through
somebody else with the same thing.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.860
What else?

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.160
You ever endured suffering and
something good came out on the other?

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.380
See, I think of a couple of things.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.810
One was, right, not me childbirth, but I
know my wife has said this, that the only

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.170
thing that got her through childbirth
was the beautiful baby on the other side.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.100
Um, so suffering obviously
was worth it, right?

00:06:38.025 --> 00:06:41.234
The other that I have
is, um, going to college.

00:06:41.245 --> 00:06:43.245
I, I don't just want you to
know this, going to college,

00:06:43.275 --> 00:06:45.315
I suffered like it was tough.

00:06:45.585 --> 00:06:48.195
It was difficult, but in the
other side was a career and a

00:06:48.195 --> 00:06:49.515
job and things like that, right?

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.215
Um, and then the other thing
I thought about is an athlete.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.289
Someone who suffers for
the sake of winning.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.210
And I just wanna give a shout out here.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.050
So we had a soccer game yesterday and
Landon, which who's not in here, this

00:07:01.055 --> 00:07:03.330
is Brian, um, Lauren's son, Landon.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.800
This is eight, nine year
old soccer, by the way.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.050
He was our goal at the last quarter.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.170
Well, the team just kept
shooting shots on goal and.

00:07:10.785 --> 00:07:12.435
He got beat up pretty bad.

00:07:12.435 --> 00:07:13.995
Like the ball, I think hit
him in the head at one time.

00:07:13.995 --> 00:07:15.675
He may have got kicked
in the head at one time.

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:19.785
And so here's what we said, like Landon
suffered so we could win the game.

00:07:19.815 --> 00:07:21.315
We won the game, by the way, one Oh.

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:22.215
So we celebrate that.

00:07:22.485 --> 00:07:25.515
But I start thinking about ath athletics,
like that idea behind we're willing

00:07:25.515 --> 00:07:28.495
to suffer for something worthwhile.

00:07:29.445 --> 00:07:32.745
Well, I know I, I'm kind of setting
this up today guys, but I want you

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.145
to look through this idea of suffer.

00:07:35.805 --> 00:07:40.095
Like Paul's challenging Timothy, not
as something that we want to avoid,

00:07:40.485 --> 00:07:44.565
but something we join for the sake
of the reward on the other side.

00:07:45.195 --> 00:07:49.765
See, I'll just tell you that I can join
something like that because it's worth it.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.590
I don't like suffering for no reason.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.790
I don't think anybody does, right?

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.820
We would say we were willing
to suffer for a reason.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.100
So as we jump into this, we're
gonna see three different

00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:00.720
examples that Paul gives us.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.500
So let's read it.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.780
This text again, we're gonna be
in second Timothy chapter two.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.050
We're gonna read from verse one
through 13 and it says this, You

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.580
therefore, my son, be strong in
the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.270
What you have heard from me and
the presence of many witnesses

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.670
commit to faithful men who will
be able to teach others also.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.539
Share in the suffering as a
good soldier of Christ Jesus.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.669
No one serving as a soldier gets entangled
in the concerns of the civilian life he

00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:31.799
seeks to please the commanding officer.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.750
Also, if anyone competes in ath as
an athlete, he is not crowned unless

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.370
he competes according to the rules.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:42.630
The hardworking farmer ought to be
first to get a share of the crops.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.460
Consider what I say for the Lord
will give you understanding in.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.200
Remember Christ Jesus risen from the dead
and descended from David according to my

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.430
gospel, for which I suffer to the point
of being bound like a criminal criminal,

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.590
but the word of God is not bound.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.660
This is why I endure all things
for the elect so that they may

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.220
also obtain salvation, which is
in Christ Jesus with eternal.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.910
This saying is trustworthy
for if we died with him.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.000
We also will live with him if we endure.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.060
We will also reign with
him if we deny him.

00:09:19.065 --> 00:09:22.660
He will also deny us and if we
are faithless, he remains faithful

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.880
for he cannot deny himself.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.160
So let's pray.

00:09:26.729 --> 00:09:30.120
Lord Jesus, we pray, Lord, that your
word, uh, brings truth in our lives,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.530
Lord, that you use your word today, uh,
to open our hearts and minds, um, to

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.310
the truth in which we Lord, not just
need to know, but we need to continue

00:09:38.314 --> 00:09:40.050
to apply to our lives, to live out.

00:09:40.439 --> 00:09:42.780
Um, Lord, we love you and we
thank you for this time, and we

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.680
pray this in your heavenly name.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.390
Amen.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.719
So the first thing that we see
is being a disciple of Jesus

00:09:48.719 --> 00:09:51.540
requires faithfulness, right?

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.900
Faithfulness to Jesus though comes with a.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.830
But a great reward.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.190
So the first thing we see here is
this example of a soldier, right?

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.380
Uh, and the characteristics
of a good soldier.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.030
So he uses this term the good soldier.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.700
And so he says The characteristics
of a good soldier is one who

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.530
endures suffering, right?

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:07.650
We are

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.260
thinking, shouldn't life be easier?

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.390
Shouldn't life be easier?

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.060
Like, I mean, Jesus has paid for my sins.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.490
Now I have a relationship with
him, the, the God of the universe.

00:10:27.495 --> 00:10:32.969
Life should be easy, but at times though,
when, when we actually search God's word,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.750
we, we see consistently over and over
many of the people who'd given their lives

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:42.240
to Christ actually suffered not just to
suffer for the sake of suffering, but to

00:10:42.245 --> 00:10:44.490
suffer for something great and something.

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.885
And so we see this when we
look at a soldier, right?

00:10:49.045 --> 00:10:53.385
A soldier enlists, knowing
that they will suffer.

00:10:53.834 --> 00:10:56.505
But many times when they enlist
the enlisting part's, the easiest

00:10:56.505 --> 00:10:58.064
part, signing paperwork, right?

00:10:58.064 --> 00:11:01.484
Agreeing to some things,
but then the work starts.

00:11:02.175 --> 00:11:02.834
Now, here's the thing.

00:11:02.834 --> 00:11:07.214
They're a soldier at the moment of
signing the dotted line and reciting

00:11:07.214 --> 00:11:08.745
whatever the commitment is to that.

00:11:09.074 --> 00:11:10.905
But the work just starts.

00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:15.840
So as Paul's talking about this idea
of a soldier, He's talking about this

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.940
idea of our commitment to Christ.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.500
You know, that's secure.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.640
We're secure in Christ, but the, the
mission of God for each one of us has

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.200
just began, and as we continue on, that
mission is for the rest of our lives.

00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:31.395
So that first one, right, as a
characteristic of a soldier is to suffer.

00:11:31.395 --> 00:11:34.545
But the second one is one
who avoids worldly things.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.485
And you'll see this, um, it gets
says, share in the suffering is

00:11:37.485 --> 00:11:38.955
a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:11:39.405 --> 00:11:42.825
No one serving as a soldier gets
entangled with in the concerns of

00:11:42.825 --> 00:11:47.055
the civilian life, but he seeks
to please the commanding officer.

00:11:48.195 --> 00:11:52.275
So when a soldier fully commits,
To the army or to the, to the

00:11:52.275 --> 00:11:53.895
enlistment in which he's committed to.

00:11:54.225 --> 00:11:58.125
He's committed to the mission in front of,
and he cannot allow anything around him to

00:11:58.675 --> 00:12:00.135
distract him from fulfilling that mission.

00:12:00.675 --> 00:12:02.595
And I wish I had, uh, Joe in here.

00:12:02.595 --> 00:12:05.235
Joe I know had served in the military
and there's probably more in here.

00:12:05.235 --> 00:12:06.195
I just knew he had.

00:12:06.195 --> 00:12:07.725
But I started thinking through this idea.

00:12:08.085 --> 00:12:13.665
Whenever a soldier gets off course from
fulfilling his mission, he puts not only

00:12:13.665 --> 00:12:15.495
his life, but the lives of others in.

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:18.135
You may not think of that.

00:12:18.135 --> 00:12:20.564
I wanna continue to go back and
forth as a follower of Jesus.

00:12:20.564 --> 00:12:24.344
His, He's challenging Timothy
and us to join in the suffering.

00:12:24.645 --> 00:12:30.375
If we don't be faithful to
the mission, it's, it's not

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:31.545
necessarily about our lives, right?

00:12:31.545 --> 00:12:34.035
Our salvation in the Lord is there.

00:12:34.574 --> 00:12:35.895
But what about the lives
of those around us?

00:12:35.895 --> 00:12:40.214
What's the mission that God has given us
to go there for and make disciples of all

00:12:40.214 --> 00:12:44.355
nations to, to share Jesus with others
because God has so changed your life.

00:12:45.135 --> 00:12:50.085
God has now called you with the gifts
that he's given you to go out and share

00:12:50.085 --> 00:12:52.065
that hope and love with other people.

00:12:52.515 --> 00:12:57.225
So when we get distracted by worldly
living, we are not fulfilling the

00:12:57.225 --> 00:13:00.735
mission that God's called us, which now
puts other people's lives on the line.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.555
And I know we can go a little bit deeper
into that, but I just started thinking

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.505
through why is Paul bringing this up?

00:13:06.255 --> 00:13:09.735
And so he's bringing this up because
he says, Faithful soldiers, faithful

00:13:09.735 --> 00:13:11.865
followers of Jesus are committed to the.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.120
And I started thinking about this example.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.800
I don't know why I chose this example.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.780
Sometimes I'm just, I just wake
up middle of the night and I

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.620
just think of these things.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.320
Think about a plumber who
goes to plumbing school.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.610
I don't even know if there's
plumbing school, right?

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.050
They gonna get their plumbing certificate.

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:25.350
I don't know.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.280
Maybe that's what it is too.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:26.580
Okay.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.460
They're gonna go to the number
one plumbing company in the world,

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:30.740
cuz that's where they wanna work.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.620
They're the best, The number one plumbing
company in the world hires them to go plum

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.390
and be the greatest plumber in the world.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.540
And every home he goes to, he
gets distracted by landscaping.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.770
How stupid does that?

00:13:42.505 --> 00:13:43.605
I mean, he went to school.

00:13:43.605 --> 00:13:44.625
He's dedicated his life.

00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:49.065
He's committed to this job, to do this
job, and he's distracted by landscaping.

00:13:49.515 --> 00:13:50.685
How long would he keep that job?

00:13:51.255 --> 00:13:54.285
Probably not very long because
what he said he was committed to,

00:13:54.555 --> 00:13:56.925
he didn't really follow through
on what he committed his life to.

00:13:56.925 --> 00:14:00.705
He didn't follow through on, I know
that's crazy weird example, because this

00:14:00.705 --> 00:14:03.075
is where Paul's challenging Timothy.

00:14:03.675 --> 00:14:03.975
Right.

00:14:04.035 --> 00:14:05.685
We're not working.

00:14:05.745 --> 00:14:06.525
I wanna be clear.

00:14:06.525 --> 00:14:08.475
We're not working for our salvation.

00:14:08.475 --> 00:14:13.095
We're working from our salvation
because we've experienced Christ's love.

00:14:13.725 --> 00:14:18.345
We are so motivated to go help
fulfill the mission that God has is

00:14:18.345 --> 00:14:22.785
to redeem the world, to save them from
their sins just like he's saved us.

00:14:23.415 --> 00:14:25.155
And so I wanna make
sure I'm clear as well.

00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:26.475
This does not mean we can't enjoy.

00:14:27.255 --> 00:14:29.805
Does this mean we have to hate
life and can't enjoy anything?

00:14:29.805 --> 00:14:30.165
Great.

00:14:30.165 --> 00:14:31.515
No, that's actually not what he is.

00:14:31.574 --> 00:14:34.275
He's saying here, we can enjoy
life, our family, the things

00:14:34.275 --> 00:14:36.824
around us in this world, but
they cannot become a distraction.

00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:37.605
That's what he says here.

00:14:37.905 --> 00:14:43.755
They do not get entangled in
the ways right of the world and

00:14:43.755 --> 00:14:46.425
allows that to distract them
from the mission that they have.

00:14:47.324 --> 00:14:50.355
And I think this is a challenge from Paul
and a challenge to us before we move.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.190
That entanglement.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:57.420
Sometimes when we get entangled in things,
we're missing God's best for our life

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.370
and for the lives of those around us.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:05.970
And when we'll choose God's mission, we
will experience a greater blessing, we'll

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.910
experience a greater fulfillment in life.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.490
I, I think back to this,
and I can only give personal

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.720
examples, I think back to this.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.580
There was a moment in my
life I was working as a

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.170
financial analyst in Oklahoma.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:20.160
We were serving in the church and God
had led me to surrender my life to.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.450
An opportunity opened up to go from
a financial analyst to be basically

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:28.920
a ministry assistant at a church, and
God called me to that and in order

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:33.150
to go fulfill that, I remember me and
Brittany having this conversation of

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.810
all the things we're going to have
to sacrifice in order to go fulfill

00:15:36.815 --> 00:15:38.190
the call that God had in my life.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.280
We chose to do that and it was difficult.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:45.480
There were seasons of
difficulty, but the reward.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.230
The lives in which we got to impact
the things that God had shown us.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:54.180
And, and crazy enough, fast forward, you
know, 10, 12 years were here, God has done

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:59.100
way more through suffering and sacrifice
than he ever would've done through ease

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.720
of just staying there, comfortable.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.500
I mean, here's the thing guys.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.630
I just gotten a big raise
and a big promotion.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:04.920
It was easy to stay.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.260
We would've had great healthcare.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.820
We wouldn't have to wonder about that.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.890
I mean, there was a lot of benefits of.

00:16:11.775 --> 00:16:14.475
But the call, the challenge for me
now, again, that's not the challenge

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.235
for everybody to, to go quit their
jobs and go to ministry, but God's

00:16:17.235 --> 00:16:18.645
got a call for each one of us.

00:16:19.455 --> 00:16:21.945
And when we're seeking the Lord,
God's gonna call us to sacrifice

00:16:21.945 --> 00:16:25.365
and, and to suffer at times
for the sake of the mission.

00:16:25.575 --> 00:16:29.055
And the cool part we're gonna see
throughout this whole story is guys

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:34.035
the reward to see life change and
to experience what God is doing.

00:16:34.455 --> 00:16:34.755
Oh man.

00:16:34.755 --> 00:16:38.355
Like way, way more worth it than
what we would've experienced from.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.270
So let's look at the second
example he gives here, right?

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.010
The first one was a soldier, right?

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.670
So faithfulness to Jesus comes
with the cost, but a great reward.

00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:49.080
The second one is this athlete.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.580
And so he says this in verse five.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:54.330
He says, Also, if anyone competes
as an athlete, he has crowned.

00:16:54.335 --> 00:16:56.700
He's not crowned unless he
competes according to the rules.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.680
So in Paul's time, athletes, you
know, that's a big deal, right?

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.089
They had, uh, the, the Olympic Games, they
had all these different sports that they

00:17:06.095 --> 00:17:08.040
did and a lot of activities that they did.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.500
And, and what I learned is
that really they're not much

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.480
more different than us, right?

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.740
Not much more different than us.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.030
Who here is gonna go home?

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.950
Not all of us will, but who here
is gonna go home and watch them?

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:17.220
Football?

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:17.640
Anybody?

00:17:18.645 --> 00:17:19.665
Okay, great.

00:17:19.665 --> 00:17:22.425
We got a couple of you who, who
went, you know, to some soccer

00:17:22.425 --> 00:17:23.385
games in the last couple weeks.

00:17:23.385 --> 00:17:26.264
I know there's a couple families that
love soccer around here, and I do know

00:17:26.264 --> 00:17:27.734
this, there was some volleyball tryouts.

00:17:27.734 --> 00:17:31.185
So you guys, So I, there's a wide
variety of people that love sports.

00:17:31.185 --> 00:17:35.534
We are a culture of sports right here
in, uh, in our area at least, right?

00:17:35.685 --> 00:17:36.865
So things have not changed.

00:17:38.235 --> 00:17:42.345
But when we look at this idea of
sports and we think about rules

00:17:42.345 --> 00:17:45.105
in Paul's time, athletes had
to be a citizen of the nation.

00:17:45.105 --> 00:17:46.544
They had to be of good reputation.

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:52.365
And, uh, most of you probably know this,
that even though some people win the race,

00:17:52.814 --> 00:17:57.074
they get the crown strip from the anybody
knows Some examples of where somebody won

00:17:57.074 --> 00:17:58.845
a race and then now they don't have that.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.340
Lance Armstrong, right?

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.270
He got all of those things.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:10.950
There's a, there's a
lot of those examples.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.090
So he's pointing to this idea behind
the requirements that it takes or

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:17.640
the the rules in which are to be
followed in order to receive the.

00:18:18.695 --> 00:18:22.445
Um, and so when we think about follow
rules, I don't know about you guys, but

00:18:22.445 --> 00:18:24.485
as a kid I hated being a rule follower.

00:18:24.485 --> 00:18:27.905
It's like this idea behind all these
strict things I gotta do and not do.

00:18:27.905 --> 00:18:30.515
Of course, I'm a people pleaser, so I
would do them so that I could please

00:18:30.515 --> 00:18:32.615
people, but there's all these rules.

00:18:33.155 --> 00:18:36.305
Well, Paul's not talking about this as
like, Okay, let's go grab the law and

00:18:36.305 --> 00:18:37.745
let's make sure we follow it to a T.

00:18:38.405 --> 00:18:42.785
But what he was really talking to and
what, why this book is important is Paul's

00:18:42.785 --> 00:18:45.215
talking about Timothy running the race.

00:18:46.215 --> 00:18:47.205
With truth, right?

00:18:47.595 --> 00:18:51.405
Recently we talked about how Timothy was
told to hold onto and protect the truth.

00:18:52.005 --> 00:18:57.285
So to follow the rules is to follow
the truth and to not stray from it.

00:18:57.285 --> 00:19:01.275
Cuz if you stray from it, then it is
not going to receive the crown that

00:19:01.275 --> 00:19:03.675
God has has given us or given Timothy.

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:08.265
And so when he is saying this, that
Timothy needs to be faithful to follow the

00:19:08.265 --> 00:19:12.315
rules so that he can be crowned, so that
we can be crowned so that he can win the.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:17.580
And so Paul was unwilling to change the
message and that unwilling to change

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.700
the message, Paul was sent to prison and
was gonna eventually die for his faith.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.270
Timothy is sitting here watching
his true father in the faith

00:19:25.379 --> 00:19:26.970
eventually be killed for his faith.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:31.770
And Timothy would be wondering,
What if I stray a little bit again?

00:19:31.774 --> 00:19:34.590
Athletes, why do they choose to cheat?

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.760
Because if that gives them an edge to
win the crown, like what if I do this?

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.600
Will I ever get caught?

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.710
Will will it change anything?

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.879
Will it make life easier?

00:19:42.945 --> 00:19:45.075
And, and for Timothy, he
could be thinking that.

00:19:45.075 --> 00:19:47.865
And so Paul is saying,
Hold on to the truth.

00:19:47.865 --> 00:19:49.215
Don't veer off.

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:49.905
Right.

00:19:49.905 --> 00:19:54.105
So Paul was viewed as a loser to most
around him, but the one who would

00:19:54.105 --> 00:19:59.415
judge him, Jesus would see him as
some someone who followed the rules.

00:20:00.225 --> 00:20:01.845
And so he eventually would win the race.

00:20:01.845 --> 00:20:06.284
And so Paul's challenged to Timothy
and to us in this point is our goal,

00:20:06.555 --> 00:20:09.855
uh, and our walks as followers of Jesus
is to not please man, but to please.

00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:14.595
And it's a good reminder for us
in the midst of pleasing God is

00:20:14.595 --> 00:20:19.755
that as we do that, you'll have
to say no to certain things.

00:20:19.755 --> 00:20:22.125
You'll have to have
difficult conversations.

00:20:22.125 --> 00:20:26.475
You'll have to choose at chi
times a difficult situation,

00:20:27.735 --> 00:20:29.355
But the reward is greater.

00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:32.865
The reward is greater
when we follow the rules.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.880
We follow what God has
called us to do in His word.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.350
Cuz his word is truth.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.560
And I always think of John
17, 17, God's word is truth.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.400
And if God's word is truth, then that's
what we have to use as a guide in our

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.700
life and a guide as we direct our church
and as guide, as we direct our families.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.890
So then he moves on, right?

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.020
He moves on from an athlete to a farmer.

00:20:52.949 --> 00:20:56.280
And the farmer part really sticks
out, sticks out to me recently,

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.370
and I wanna read these verses here
because he says this and he says, The

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:03.179
hardworking farmer ought to be the
first one to get the share of the crops.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.790
And I saw this word, the hardworking
farmer, not just a farmer.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.919
Anybody ever seen a farmer
and a hardworking farmer?

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.370
I, I think that you can't separate those
two because if you're gonna have a farm,

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:12.419
you're gonna have to be a hard worker.

00:21:12.419 --> 00:21:13.949
And if you don't, you
wanna have a farm long.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:19.020
Um, most people work from, you know,
daylight to sundown basically, right?

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:19.560
They're working.

00:21:20.835 --> 00:21:22.785
And so he says this hardworking farmer.

00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:26.835
And so when we think about a farmer,
they plow, they sow and they water.

00:21:27.075 --> 00:21:30.825
But there's a part to me in the
farming that stuck out to me.

00:21:31.754 --> 00:21:33.345
It's the patience and waiting.

00:21:34.425 --> 00:21:35.355
Who likes waiting?

00:21:36.764 --> 00:21:37.935
That's why we have fast food.

00:21:38.175 --> 00:21:39.045
We don't have to wait.

00:21:39.225 --> 00:21:39.615
Right?

00:21:40.275 --> 00:21:43.725
Um, and that's what we think about
this patience is it was difficult.

00:21:44.295 --> 00:21:48.285
And so whenever we look at this,
Paul is clearly telling Timothy and.

00:21:49.305 --> 00:21:53.355
That we are to work hard, not for
our salvations, but for the Lord

00:21:54.165 --> 00:21:57.225
and willing to fill our call and
what God has called us to do.

00:21:57.855 --> 00:22:01.065
And we will receive a share of
the crops and the reward first.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.655
And so let's look at what it means, right?

00:22:02.775 --> 00:22:03.465
How so?

00:22:03.465 --> 00:22:08.115
What rewards does someone
receive in working hard?

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.450
For the Lord.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:13.470
Number one, you receive salvation
just through obviously faith in

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.500
Jesus, but it's the reward of stories.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.480
It's the reward of life change around you.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.960
So anybody here ever been a part of
somebody else coming to faith in Christ?

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:22.500
Anybody.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:23.730
Okay.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:24.420
A couple people.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:25.200
Okay.

00:22:25.205 --> 00:22:26.250
You've been a part of their journey.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.050
Is there a sense inside you that,
of a fulfillment of, of something

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.450
greater that God would even
use you to be a part of that?

00:22:36.225 --> 00:22:37.245
I would agree with that.

00:22:37.725 --> 00:22:40.635
And, and if you haven't experienced
that, my, my challenge for you is

00:22:40.935 --> 00:22:43.245
begin to pray right now for God
to put somebody on your heart.

00:22:43.365 --> 00:22:44.415
Begin to share with them.

00:22:44.955 --> 00:22:48.375
And when you see people give their lives
to Christ, when you see people begin to

00:22:48.615 --> 00:22:52.785
understand the truth of God's word, apply
it to their lives, that transformation

00:22:53.685 --> 00:22:58.035
you getting to be a part of that is
amazing because the, the hard work and

00:22:58.035 --> 00:23:03.135
the sacrifice that it takes to, to invest
in that person and to see life change.

00:23:04.335 --> 00:23:04.995
It's worth it.

00:23:05.294 --> 00:23:06.105
It's worth it.

00:23:06.284 --> 00:23:11.504
And that's really where we're seeing
here is this hard work that happens in

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.335
the midst of following Jesus, right?

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.395
Followers of Jesus who suffer,
put in the hard work, will enjoy

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:17.685
the fruits of their labor first.

00:23:18.254 --> 00:23:21.825
But here's what we know is that sometimes
farming, there's disappointments.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.355
Anybody ever heard about that, right?

00:23:23.355 --> 00:23:23.534
Yeah.

00:23:23.655 --> 00:23:25.386
You do all the hard work
and it doesn't rain.

00:23:27.245 --> 00:23:27.596
It doesn't.

00:23:28.965 --> 00:23:32.085
I, I know some people that's done all
the hard work and then they had high

00:23:32.085 --> 00:23:35.865
fences and the deer still jumped over the
fences and ate all their crops, right?

00:23:36.105 --> 00:23:36.375
No.

00:23:36.375 --> 00:23:38.625
Sometimes you put on hard work
and it just doesn't come out.

00:23:38.715 --> 00:23:42.585
And this is where we realize that the
trusting factor of Jesus, that he is

00:23:42.585 --> 00:23:46.215
the one that brings the harvest that
we are to put in the work, right?

00:23:46.455 --> 00:23:47.595
I wanna give you guys an example here.

00:23:47.595 --> 00:23:49.335
They're gonna throw up some
pictures here of my house.

00:23:49.575 --> 00:23:51.915
We recently, uh, built a
house on the west side.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.960
And the ground was horrible.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.790
So you see on the left
side, this is not our house.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.950
The ground was that
horrible ground over there.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:03.690
And so I, James isn't here, but
James actually brought over dirt,

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.330
a ton of dirt, um, was a week ago.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:12.389
And, uh, our family hand laid this
dirt by ourselves laying it all out.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:17.430
Well, in the midst of doing that,
I really appreciated, um, machinery

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.260
that can do that in about two hours.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:19.830
And we did it in.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.190
14.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:25.200
Um, and then the effects of it, there
was some suffering that came in this.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.220
The effects of it was Monday morning
I woke up with vertigo a and to come

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.370
to figure out, it was from all the
tension in my shoulders and my neck from

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.340
shoveling and I suffered all Monday.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.980
I've never experienced that before, but
I don't ever wanna experience it again.

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.460
Um, and so in the midst of doing
this, I kind of had this image

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.850
of like, farming is difficult.

00:24:45.525 --> 00:24:46.515
Farming is difficult.

00:24:46.515 --> 00:24:47.445
It's hard work.

00:24:47.835 --> 00:24:49.785
It costs a lot of money, right?

00:24:50.085 --> 00:24:53.985
Uh, it it, it took a lot of work
to lay out everything and, and

00:24:53.985 --> 00:24:56.085
here's the thing that was just dirt.

00:24:56.625 --> 00:25:00.885
We haven't even seen the grass
yet, but I'll tell you this.

00:25:00.975 --> 00:25:02.685
Just, just wanna lean
into this a little bit.

00:25:03.315 --> 00:25:05.355
When the first sprout comes,
you know what I'm gonna do?

00:25:05.355 --> 00:25:08.955
I'm gonna probably be texting
people, pictures, . What do we do?

00:25:09.445 --> 00:25:12.405
We celebrate hard work.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:17.790
For the Lord is not for our salvations,
but from our salvations we've experienced

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:23.070
so much that we want others to experience
that, so we're willing to put in the work.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.850
And here's my prayer, when spring comes,
we're gonna start seeing some sprouts.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.500
And when it does you, you don't wanna
know who I'm gonna be able to thank.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.320
Not just just myself for
the hard work, but the Lord.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.100
You wanna know why?

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:40.380
Because the Lord's the one that brings
the rain and the sun and the nutrients.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.580
I can't do that.

00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:43.770
God can now, man, we can do water.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:44.580
I guess we can do that.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.929
But then God provided the water, right?

00:25:45.929 --> 00:25:49.980
But in the end essence, I just saw
this picture where we put in the

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:54.629
hard work unto the Lord and we've
gotta let the Lord bring the harvest.

00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:59.429
But then I started thinking here because
hey, everybody knows here, we're a

00:25:59.429 --> 00:26:03.120
church plant year and a half in since
launching, uh, we've been here for

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:08.010
almost three years, and I'll just tell
you, three years of planting a church

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.929
since we've moved here, it's difficult.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:18.420
Right, but, But we've seen
a church go from six to 60.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.720
There's been a lot of life change.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.340
Every one of you that are here, I've
seen so many amazing things happen in

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:31.140
your life over these seasons and my
prayers that will continue to see those.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.480
And the hard work and labor that we
poured into it is not in vain, cuz I

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.750
know it's not in vain because God has
been working and will continue to work.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.580
And when we continue to see that,
that God through our hard work, not

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.640
for ourselves, but for His glory
and for others, it's worth it.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.130
But it's going to take,
this is the whole picture.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.420
It's gonna take some suffering.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:56.880
And, and, and if you think back to what
is suffering, it's not fun at times.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:57.600
Right.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.220
We may suffer as a soldier.

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.090
Was following the Lord despite
what's going on around us.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.120
It may be the athlete that's trying
to win the race, and we were trying

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:10.409
to follow by the rules, the truth, the
word of God, but it also might be the

00:27:10.415 --> 00:27:12.240
farmer that has to get your hands dirty.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.090
I'll just tell you this, I
had so much dirt in my ears.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.440
I think that may be why I had rodeo two.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.879
I had so much dirt in my ears.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.090
You may spend days getting
that out, but it's worth it.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:22.649
It's worth.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:24.750
Why is it worth it?

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.060
This is the part that I,
I, I want us to lean into.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:30.660
Verses eight through 13,
The reason for suffering.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:35.460
The reason for suffering is because
Jesus', death, barrel, and resurrection

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.650
was for everyone, not just us.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:38.850
So let's read this text.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.880
He says, Remember and I love, if
you'll go through the Bible in

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.260
a year with your physical Bible
and underline the word, remember.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.199
You'll be amazed at how many
times it's in the Bible.

00:27:49.199 --> 00:27:50.399
I don't know how many
times, but I did that.

00:27:50.399 --> 00:27:53.699
And in my Bible, I have the word,
remember underlined in every

00:27:53.699 --> 00:27:57.480
part of the Bible because I just
saw it as an impactful word.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:01.110
And so Paul is saying, Remember
Jesus Christ risen from the dead

00:28:01.115 --> 00:28:05.219
and descended from David according
to my gospel for which I suffer.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:09.300
So Paul has already suffered to the point
of being bound like a criminal criminal,

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.550
but the word of God is not bound.

00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:13.770
And this is why I.

00:28:14.655 --> 00:28:19.515
All thanks for the elect so that they
also may obtain salvation, which is

00:28:19.515 --> 00:28:21.825
in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

00:28:22.905 --> 00:28:27.405
Paul said I suffered for
the sake of other people.

00:28:28.455 --> 00:28:31.845
Paul already knew that he would
spend an eternity with God.

00:28:32.505 --> 00:28:34.665
Paul already knew that
his sins were forgiven.

00:28:35.115 --> 00:28:38.305
Paul already knew that he was taken care.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:44.160
And he understood this picture that
Christ Jesus came into the world to

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.740
save sinners, not just to save Paul.

00:28:47.879 --> 00:28:53.070
And I'll just tell you, when we go
back up to the soldier, we tend to

00:28:53.075 --> 00:28:56.760
be the soldier that gets distracted
because we begin to live out of faith.

00:28:56.764 --> 00:28:57.690
That is Christ.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:04.440
Jesus died for my sins, my comfort,
my plans, my safety, and no one else.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.910
Now you wouldn't say
that, just so you know.

00:29:05.915 --> 00:29:08.010
I wouldn't say that either,
but sometimes my life trends.

00:29:09.135 --> 00:29:13.034
And why do we have the word of God
to correct us, to draw us back?

00:29:25.034 --> 00:29:26.415
This is all who Christ died for.

00:29:26.655 --> 00:29:28.585
We could leave out here
and celebrate and be done.

00:29:29.054 --> 00:29:30.405
But God is not done.

00:29:30.405 --> 00:29:32.355
And this is why Paul says
he's endured everything.

00:29:32.355 --> 00:29:35.955
This is why he's challenging
us to endure all things.

00:29:36.105 --> 00:29:39.314
So it's challenge to Timothy and
to us, And here's just an example.

00:29:40.094 --> 00:29:46.365
God has saved you from a burning bishop,
bur burning, bush, burning, uh, building.

00:29:46.574 --> 00:29:49.605
If you've given your life to Christ, God
has saved you from that burning building.

00:29:50.385 --> 00:29:52.064
But here's the crazy part that he's doing.

00:29:52.064 --> 00:29:53.235
He's sending you right back in.

00:29:53.594 --> 00:29:57.794
To be a part of saving someone else is,
is there a chance you're gonna get burned?

00:29:58.935 --> 00:30:01.845
Yeah, but I've, I've
quoted this to you before.

00:30:02.085 --> 00:30:06.045
True friends and I'll, maybe you would
say this, true followers are Christ,

00:30:06.045 --> 00:30:10.245
are those who are running in when
everybody else is running out, right?

00:30:10.605 --> 00:30:14.895
I'm telling you, as a faller
of Jesus, it's gonna take you

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.275
running into burning buildings.

00:30:16.275 --> 00:30:18.975
It's gonna take you,
sacrificing your time.

00:30:19.815 --> 00:30:21.165
It's gonna take you,
sacrificing your money.

00:30:21.165 --> 00:30:22.515
It's gonna take you sacrificing.

00:30:22.515 --> 00:30:23.925
Just so you know, this
is difficult for me.

00:30:23.925 --> 00:30:24.105
My.

00:30:25.575 --> 00:30:28.754
My uncomfortableness, which means this
at times, talking about Jesus to people,

00:30:28.905 --> 00:30:31.035
even as a pastor, gets uncomfortable.

00:30:31.185 --> 00:30:31.754
Why?

00:30:31.965 --> 00:30:33.254
Because people look at you funny.

00:30:34.605 --> 00:30:36.915
Why do you kid admit your
life to go follow Jesus?

00:30:37.875 --> 00:30:38.955
Because he's a pretty cool dude.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.615
He's changed my life.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:40.845
They're like, Well,
that doesn't make sense.

00:30:40.995 --> 00:30:42.525
Well, then I start telling
him my story, right?

00:30:42.735 --> 00:30:48.735
All these things may be difficult,
but Paul shows us as an example of why

00:30:48.735 --> 00:30:50.715
he did it, and Jesus was our first.

00:30:51.915 --> 00:30:55.305
So we were saved from our brokenness
and sin from an eternity separated from

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.665
God, so that we could be sent out to
help others from their brokenness and

00:30:58.665 --> 00:31:01.185
sin from an eternity separated from God.

00:31:01.935 --> 00:31:06.375
There will be suffering in order to
help people, but it's worth it to

00:31:06.375 --> 00:31:10.215
experience the joy of seeing more
and more people come to know Jesus.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:14.730
And then he says this, this,
uh, uh, saying is trustworthy

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.160
in versus 13 or 11 through 13.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.850
He says, This saying is trustworthy for
if and I I, I guess if you ever see the

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:27.240
word, if this is our choice, this is our
choice for if we died with him, right?

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.690
So if we died with him in our sins,
we repented and believed, then we will

00:31:31.695 --> 00:31:33.630
also live with him now in an eternity.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.340
We'll also live with
him now in an eternity.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.140
And if we endure.

00:31:37.605 --> 00:31:38.895
We will also reign with him.

00:31:38.895 --> 00:31:40.875
That word endure is to suffer.

00:31:40.875 --> 00:31:46.125
If we suffer, we will be able
to reign with him in heaven.

00:31:46.754 --> 00:31:51.405
But then he says this, If we
deny him, he will also deny us.

00:31:52.095 --> 00:31:55.524
There's times that when we look at God
and we're like, Well, how dare he deny me?

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.620
Here's, here's what he's offered is if,
if you'll have faith in him, he, he,

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:05.310
he's not going to deny you, but if you
deny him, you deny who he is, why he

00:32:05.315 --> 00:32:09.000
came, that you have brokenness and sin
in your life, then he will deny you.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.330
At the end of time, all of us will be
judged and he will deny you, not because

00:32:12.335 --> 00:32:15.000
of his choice, but because of yours.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:20.610
But then he says this, He says, Then
also if you're faithless, he remains

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:22.709
faithful and he cannot deny himself.

00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:26.070
What he is saying here is that
at times we struggle with faith.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:29.730
At times we struggle to be
faithful to God, but God is

00:32:29.735 --> 00:32:31.649
not faithless in those moments.

00:32:31.655 --> 00:32:33.570
He's still there.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.949
He's still remains faithful to
you, always willing to forgive you,

00:32:37.949 --> 00:32:41.429
always willing to be present in
the midst of suffering with you.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.560
He does not leave you there nor forsake.

00:32:45.195 --> 00:32:46.155
Jay Hudson Taylor.

00:32:46.155 --> 00:32:48.705
This will be my last statement and I'm
gonna kind of close here, but Jay Hudson

00:32:48.705 --> 00:32:53.355
Taylor said this, it is not by trying
to be faithful, but in looking to the

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.635
faithful one that we win the victory.

00:32:56.175 --> 00:33:01.215
It is not trying to be faithful, but
looking to the faithful one that we

00:33:01.215 --> 00:33:07.585
will win the victory as a disciple and
follower of Jesus faithfulness DI comes

00:33:07.585 --> 00:33:09.945
with the cost, but the reward is great.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:14.640
Jesus Christ came to this world,
not to just save you, not to just

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.550
save me, not for us just to meet
here on a Sunday morning guest.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:18.510
So here's what I'll tell you this.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:19.830
I love Sunday mornings.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:20.460
You wanna know why?

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:21.510
Because you guys are here.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:22.740
I like hanging out with you.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.850
I like seeing the word of God.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:25.680
I like being able to
praise Jesus together.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.410
But God has called us together
to dive into his word, to send us

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:38.250
out into the world, not to judge
them, but to help them be saved.

00:33:38.925 --> 00:33:40.725
From their sins, from their brokenness.

00:33:41.445 --> 00:33:45.254
And Paul's last request to Timothy was
to take everything that he had stewarded.

00:33:45.254 --> 00:33:45.645
Well.

00:33:45.675 --> 00:33:50.385
The message of the gospel had to hold fast
and strong to it and to continue that on.

00:33:50.385 --> 00:33:52.185
And that is Paul's challenge to us today.

00:33:52.185 --> 00:33:57.764
Hold fast to the word of God and the
message of God and suffer alongside him.

00:33:57.945 --> 00:33:59.355
Church, here's my challenge to you.

00:33:59.355 --> 00:34:01.965
I believe God has brought this word.

00:34:01.965 --> 00:34:03.045
I believe it's all time.

00:34:03.645 --> 00:34:07.185
If you don't believe that, if you ever
study your word in the morning or, or

00:34:07.185 --> 00:34:10.425
it's you hear some song on the radio
or it's a Sunday morning message and

00:34:10.425 --> 00:34:13.455
you don't think that that's divinely
by God, I, I, I, you're missing it.

00:34:13.455 --> 00:34:15.465
God has divined this
text for us as a church.

00:34:15.465 --> 00:34:18.975
Now it is time to join
in on the suffering.

00:34:19.335 --> 00:34:19.755
Why?

00:34:20.685 --> 00:34:23.385
Because there are people waiting for
us on the other side of our obedience.

00:34:26.505 --> 00:34:26.864
Amen.

00:34:27.525 --> 00:34:28.364
Let's not leave him waiting.

00:34:29.145 --> 00:34:30.135
So what's it gonna take?

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:32.340
We need to suffer like a soldier.

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:34.020
We need to race like an athlete.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:37.440
We need to labor like a farmer
to see God's kingdom expanded

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.940
during this time of invitation.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.230
Here's my challenge for you.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.260
First of all, this is
where it always starts.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:50.130
If you try doing without being in Christ,
you're doing for the wrong reasons.

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:54.040
Christ Jesus is the one, and this
is why I wanna mention this before

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.260
we move on through invitation.

00:34:55.665 --> 00:34:59.625
He says his grace has been given to
us through salvation to provide the

00:34:59.625 --> 00:35:02.265
power to accomplish the tasks at hand.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:07.049
So when we are trying to work for
our salvation, we are missing it.

00:35:07.259 --> 00:35:10.440
Christ Jesus has done
that on the cross for us.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.870
So if you haven't given your
life to him today, you can.

00:35:12.875 --> 00:35:15.600
You can give your life to Jesus
every time during an invitation.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.850
I stand in the back because I
don't want you to feel like you

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:18.900
have to come all the way up front.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.970
I want you to be able to come back
there and have a conversation.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.190
If you have a question about to
follow Jesus and how to give your

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.200
life to Jesus, that's where it starts.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.600
If you need prayer, come
back there and see me.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.009
I would love to pray with you as well.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.870
But for those of you who have given
your life to Christ, here's my c.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.680
If you an invitation,
don't just sit there.

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.220
I would love for you to just ask
the Lord this question where, Lord,

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.270
are you asking me to suffer more
for, for the sake of the gospel?

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.810
And that is a challenging
question to ask the Lord.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.370
Where are you asking me to suffer more?

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.940
You know what?

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.740
That's gonna take surrender.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.700
Because if you're not willing to
surrender, you know that one area,

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.620
Lord, like you'll say everywhere, but.

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.580
Maybe it's your time everywhere, but
here, maybe it's your finances everywhere,

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.220
but here, maybe it's my, my, uh, pride.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.759
Lay that down before the Lord and
ask the Lord to help you overcome

00:36:06.765 --> 00:36:11.400
that, not just for your sake, but
for the sake of those around you.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:18.990
God loves you so much, but he also loves
your friends, your neighbors, your family

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:23.730
members so much as well as a church.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:24.360
I wanna challenge you with.

00:36:25.215 --> 00:36:29.895
We exist to inspire hope by helping
people discover God's purpose for their

00:36:29.895 --> 00:36:31.995
life through a relationship with Jesus.

00:36:33.585 --> 00:36:36.855
Every person in this room has a
purpose by God to help other people

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.495
know him, and it'll only happen
through relationship with Jesus.

00:36:39.855 --> 00:36:43.845
Come to Jesus, Surrender wherever
you're struggling, to surrender your

00:36:43.845 --> 00:36:45.825
life to him, and we'll go outta here.

00:36:45.825 --> 00:36:46.125
Change.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.515
Let's pray.

00:36:46.515 --> 00:36:50.715
Lord Jesus, thank you so much
for who you are and how your

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.695
word reminds us of the truth.

00:36:54.615 --> 00:36:57.765
Lord that you have given
us as a guide to follow.

00:36:58.515 --> 00:37:02.924
So Lord, as we run this race, to follow
in such a way that we don't lead people

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:07.305
astray or lead our lives astray, but
God, I just pray that as we look as, as

00:37:07.694 --> 00:37:13.035
at this example from Paul's challenge
to Timothy, to joining him, uh, with

00:37:13.035 --> 00:37:17.774
him and the suffering, God, I can't help
but see that you are asking us the same.

00:37:19.004 --> 00:37:22.904
As a church, as individuals in this
room to join in on the suffering.

00:37:23.475 --> 00:37:28.125
Not to just suffer for the sake of
suffering, but to suffer for a good cause.

00:37:29.745 --> 00:37:34.035
So, Lord, I pray that as we join in
on that in the days and weeks ahead,

00:37:35.415 --> 00:37:39.464
Lord, I pray that you are honored, Lord,
that your kingdom is expanded, that

00:37:39.464 --> 00:37:44.504
we get to experience the first fruits
of it, the joy of seeing lives trans.

00:37:45.435 --> 00:37:48.555
Lord, maybe it's even getting to enjoy
the first fruits, Lord of salvation.

00:37:48.555 --> 00:37:50.055
If there's someone in this room
that hasn't given their lives

00:37:50.055 --> 00:37:54.645
to you, God, we thank you for
this church, for these people.

00:37:55.185 --> 00:37:58.275
Um, and Lord, we're just praying
for all of us to leave outta here.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.625
Change today because of your word.

00:38:00.195 --> 00:38:01.275
So we pray this in your heaven name.

00:38:01.605 --> 00:38:02.095
Amen.

00:38:08.385 --> 00:38:11.355
So we encourage you to just
meditate for a few minutes.
