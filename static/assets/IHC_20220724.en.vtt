00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:03.270
To the front.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.880
All right, let's try this again.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.270
Here we go.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:08.460
All right.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.570
Well welcome everybody.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.670
Good to see you guys.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.620
It's good to be back.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.370
Getting the opportunity to speak
again with, uh, Nick being out

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.880
last week or assuming Nick being
in and me being out last week.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.560
Um, but it's good to be here to be able
to share with you guys, um, this week

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.020
we're gonna be in Psalm chapter three.

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.780
Um, so if you wanna go ahead
and turn there, you can Psalm

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.970
chapter three and, um, we will,
um, jump in here in just a minute.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.440
So let me ask this question.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.420
Um, have you guys ever felt like
nothing is going right in your life?

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.129
It seems like you wake up and your tires.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.110
Then you get your tire fixed.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.810
And the next thing you know,
like some kid's sick, right.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.110
And you gotta come home and then after
your kid's sick, then you realize

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.800
that, you know, something else is
broken at the house or you name it.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.010
Right?

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.710
Like you, you feel like
you're the only one, sometimes

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.360
that things are going wrong.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.129
And it seems like that.

00:01:05.504 --> 00:01:07.845
No matter what everything's
working against you.

00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:11.475
Um, and I would even say this, um, I tend
to be this person that is self defeated.

00:01:11.475 --> 00:01:14.145
So even your own self, like you're just
really even frustrated with yourself.

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:16.875
Like you can't even be,
um, like positive thinking.

00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:20.205
Um, and I can relate with you in that
the text that we're gonna deal with

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.035
today is gonna be talking about David.

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:24.405
who is dealing with a personal struggle.

00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:26.085
And I'll give you a little bit
more details here in just a little

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:29.265
bit, but the reason why I wanted to
bring that up is just this thought.

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:32.025
At times when we are going
through difficult, th times we

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.855
struggle to keep the faith, right?

00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:38.595
We struggle to keep having
faith, despite our circumstances.

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:43.845
And the truth is when we look around,
you may be a lot like me, the grass

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:45.645
always seems greener on the other side.

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:46.875
Anybody ever think about that?

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:48.495
Like that person, nothing ever goes.

00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:52.545
That person seems to always have all
the money they need all the time off.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.735
They need, you know,
their family's perfect.

00:01:55.035 --> 00:01:55.215
Right.

00:01:55.255 --> 00:01:59.775
They, they, I guarantee they never
fight their kids always listen.

00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:03.075
Uh, again, I don't know if that's
you, but at times that's me where I

00:02:03.075 --> 00:02:07.425
begin to think and go, man, there's
gotta be, uh, just this I'm the

00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:08.715
only one with all these issues.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.190
But truth is we're all broken.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.000
We've all struggled.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.870
We all have things that go wrong in life.

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:18.060
Whether, you know, we share them or not.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.579
And I would just say this
there's some that are just

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.709
better at hiding it than others.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.880
There's some people that just
seem like, man, it's always good.

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:28.140
You know, you ask 'em how are you doing?

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.709
Oh, it's great.

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:29.100
Great.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.359
It seems like they're always joyful.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.890
And, uh, maybe they are, but I
would say deep down inside, they're

00:02:34.894 --> 00:02:37.519
struggling with something different
than maybe what you're struggling.

00:02:38.055 --> 00:02:42.255
Um, and so let me just give you an example
why this is, is maybe a way that we, we

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.635
just tend to handle things differently.

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:47.055
Um, so my son's actually playing
football this year, tackle football.

00:02:47.505 --> 00:02:50.055
Not that I've necessarily seen this, but
I, I was starting to think through this.

00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:52.665
And there's times where those,
those coaches are pretty rough.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.035
You ever had a football coaches
yell at you and scream at you to do

00:02:55.035 --> 00:02:56.295
something because you did it wrong.

00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:58.725
See, some kids respond
really well to that.

00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:01.005
And some kids it demoralizes them.

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:01.785
Right.

00:03:02.024 --> 00:03:04.575
But then you take that same kid that
gets yelled at that, that actually

00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:05.745
just encourages them to do things.

00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:09.464
And you have somebody that starts to pick
on 'em and that really frustrates them.

00:03:09.524 --> 00:03:11.954
They can't handle when somebody picks
on 'em, but you take the other kid

00:03:12.614 --> 00:03:14.984
that gets demoralized when somebody's
yelling at 'em, but a kid picks on 'em

00:03:14.984 --> 00:03:16.065
and they can let it roll off their back.

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:16.454
Right.

00:03:16.755 --> 00:03:18.464
What I would say is we're all different.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.424
We all struggle with different things,
but it doesn't mean one person's better

00:03:22.424 --> 00:03:25.605
than the other person, because they
struggle with it differently than you.

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:28.304
So I would just say this and maybe
something that you struggle with.

00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:32.025
Somebody else doesn't and at
times, again, we look and we think,

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:33.495
man, they have a perfect life.

00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:34.545
They don't have a struggling marriage.

00:03:34.545 --> 00:03:35.295
They don't have struggling kids.

00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:38.115
They don't have financial issues,
but the truth is, and in some

00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:39.465
form of fashion, we're all broken.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.055
We're all struggling.

00:03:41.565 --> 00:03:44.355
Some of us are just better
at hiding it than others.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.115
Some of us are better with
maybe walking through it.

00:03:47.415 --> 00:03:50.715
And I think this text today will
challenge us with how David.

00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:53.835
Was able to keep the faith
despite his circumstances.

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:56.265
So lemme just kind of catch
you up on where David is.

00:03:56.385 --> 00:04:00.765
This is king David from the old
Testament, um, king David, most of

00:04:00.765 --> 00:04:03.105
us probably know, but if you don't,
we're gonna kind of catch you up.

00:04:03.105 --> 00:04:08.235
But in this text in Psalm three, he's
actually running from his son ABSM.

00:04:08.895 --> 00:04:10.575
And how did David get to this point?

00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:13.785
See, David was known as a
man after God's own heart.

00:04:14.025 --> 00:04:16.755
If you were to just take
that title and go, man.

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.959
I wish like God would look at me
and say, Ben man, after God's own

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.460
heart, like that's a great title to.

00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:27.344
And if you look early on in
David's story, most of us know

00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:29.445
David and Goliath's story, right?

00:04:29.505 --> 00:04:31.305
David was successful at a young age.

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:33.315
God had anointed him as the next king.

00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:36.044
And it seemed like even as
David began to grow up, he was

00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:37.575
always successful in battles.

00:04:37.575 --> 00:04:41.354
And even when the odds were against
him, right when the king was against

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:42.945
him, king SA was against him.

00:04:43.065 --> 00:04:46.245
It seemed like David always
just responded correctly.

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:46.515
Right.

00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:48.224
There was the time where he
actually cut the robe of.

00:04:48.975 --> 00:04:50.565
And he felt so bad about it.

00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:53.115
He ran out and said, Hey,
you know, I am so sorry.

00:04:53.115 --> 00:04:57.965
Like, it seemed like David had it
all together, but even David A.

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:02.835
King after God's own heart, made a
mistake and had a struggle in his life.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.065
And this one was a pretty big struggle.

00:05:04.065 --> 00:05:06.195
And most of you, again, may know the
story, but I'm gonna kind of catch you up.

00:05:06.365 --> 00:05:10.485
David, uh, made a big mistake
by making one small mistake.

00:05:10.605 --> 00:05:13.935
He used to be a king that would lead
his men out to battle and he chose.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.390
To not go out to battle.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.630
He actually chose to stay
at home and he got idle.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.500
And when he got idle, he began to seek
fulfillment outside of the will of.

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:26.145
When we began to seek fulfillment
outside the will of God, he began to seek

00:05:26.265 --> 00:05:28.425
another woman, and this is Beth Sheba.

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:28.875
Right.

00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:32.415
And he began to, uh, he slept with
her, she got pregnant and David

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.575
goes, oh no, I made a big mistake.

00:05:34.815 --> 00:05:38.625
So rather than admitting his mistake,
he tries to, you know, cover it up.

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:41.534
So he tries to get Bathsheba's husband
to come back and sleep with her so they

00:05:41.534 --> 00:05:42.825
can kind of play it off as their child.

00:05:42.825 --> 00:05:43.485
That didn't work.

00:05:43.515 --> 00:05:44.445
Cuz he wouldn't do it.

00:05:45.164 --> 00:05:46.635
Then he says, let's just kill him.

00:05:46.725 --> 00:05:47.025
Right.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.085
So then VA Juba's husband was
sent to the front of the lines

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.015
and he was killed in the.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.990
And David married BA Sheba
and he thought, ah, good.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.950
I covered it up.

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:59.849
But then a prophet came and he
called out David sins and David

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:01.500
recognized it and repented.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.969
But even when David repented, it didn't
take away his consequences of his sin.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.490
So when we're talking today, I just
wanna be clear when we're talking

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.310
this today, we're talking about
how difficult our circumstances

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.510
are and how we can have faith.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.479
We're not just talking about how
we have difficult circumstances

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:16.440
because of our own sin.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.729
That's David's story in this.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.990
And that could be our story where our
sin has brought about consequences

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.280
of the, the things we have.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.890
But for some of us, it could
just be the difficulties of life.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.500
But I wanted you to know the
setting that David ends in.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.950
Right?

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.940
What happened?

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.220
What were the consequences
of David's sins?

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.690
Uh, from obviously everything that he
had done was won the loss of his son.

00:06:37.035 --> 00:06:40.425
And number two was his kingdom
would be taken from him.

00:06:40.425 --> 00:06:41.355
And I wanna read this.

00:06:41.565 --> 00:06:44.865
It says that God said to David,
your sword, the sword shall

00:06:44.865 --> 00:06:46.335
never depart from your house.

00:06:46.335 --> 00:06:50.055
I will rise up evil against you,
even from your own own household.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.650
So, this is where we see David's son
had conspired against him and got

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.390
some of his, uh, people and some of
his friends to take over the kingdom.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.060
And David had to run from
his son for his life.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.750
So David went from being the king,
the God, or the man after God's

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.870
own heart, to running for his life.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.030
And this is where we
pick up in Psalm three.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.630
So I want to go ahead and jump in this
so we can all see how David kept the

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.730
faith, despite his dire circumstances.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.820
So it says this in Psalm.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.730
it says, Lord, how my foes have increased.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.900
There are many who attack
me many say about me.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:35.400
There is no help from him in God Salla,
but you Lord are a shield around me,

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:41.010
my glory, the one who lifts up my
head, I cry aloud to the Lord and he

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.410
answers me from his holy mountain.

00:07:43.935 --> 00:07:49.875
Say I lie down and I sleep and I wake
up again because the Lord sustains me.

00:07:50.385 --> 00:07:53.655
I will not be afraid of the thousands
of people who have taken their

00:07:53.655 --> 00:07:59.685
stand against me on every side,
rise up, Lord, save me my God.

00:07:59.685 --> 00:08:01.815
You strike all my enemies on the cheek.

00:08:01.935 --> 00:08:06.015
And you break the teeth of the wicked
salvation, belongs to the Lord.

00:08:06.224 --> 00:08:09.855
May your blessings beyond
your people, Salem.

00:08:10.755 --> 00:08:12.345
Let's pray and invite God in today.

00:08:12.345 --> 00:08:12.975
Lord Jesus.

00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:14.715
We just pray Lord that you take this text.

00:08:15.195 --> 00:08:19.845
You take Lord, um, our lives and
you begin to mold them together.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.975
Lord, help us learn from king David
Lord, where he was in a desperate

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.505
and dire situation and Lord how
he kept the faith in how he was

00:08:29.505 --> 00:08:32.565
reminded Lord of your faithfulness.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:33.270
Lord.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:37.169
I pray that we walk out here today
being reminded of that same thing,

00:08:37.175 --> 00:08:39.390
Lord, that you are, God, you are good.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.480
You are one that is with us, that
you'll never leave us nor forsake

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.030
us, that you will fight for us.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.310
And that there is victory on
this other side of that fight.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.340
So Lord, we pray all of
this in your heavenly name.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.300
Amen.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.610
So the first thing we're gonna see here is
how David responded to his circumstance.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.160
The first thing we're gonna
see how David responded to his

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.200
circumstance was with a desperate.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.449
again.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.160
I, I, I think we all can relate on this.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.949
When's the, the time you typically pray.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:14.040
When do you typically pray when you
have, what was that when you're in

00:09:14.045 --> 00:09:18.030
trouble, when you have a major need
now, again, some of you are probably

00:09:18.035 --> 00:09:21.780
really spiritual and the most of the
time you pray just when life's great.

00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:24.959
And I'm, I'm thankful that you
do, we should pray at all times.

00:09:25.335 --> 00:09:30.314
But typically we relate with David when
our lives are in a dire situation, we

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.365
have a financial issue, a car issue, a
health issue, a family issue, you name it.

00:09:34.785 --> 00:09:36.165
We are seeking the Lord.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.385
Like me and Brit were
watching a movie last night.

00:09:38.385 --> 00:09:41.415
And even most of the movies, it seems like
they have nothing that they care about.

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:45.255
God, there was a dire and desperate
situation and this guy's not even a

00:09:45.255 --> 00:09:49.064
believer and he's like praying out to God,
God, if you're real, I really need you.

00:09:49.125 --> 00:09:52.125
If you could show up now, it
seems that we all get that right.

00:09:52.845 --> 00:09:57.045
We go to God, but let's see
how David goes to God with

00:09:57.045 --> 00:09:58.605
this, with this desperate plea.

00:09:58.605 --> 00:10:01.455
And so he says this, but
you no, excuse me, Lord.

00:10:01.455 --> 00:10:02.745
How my foes increased.

00:10:02.745 --> 00:10:04.215
There are many who attack me.

00:10:04.545 --> 00:10:09.405
So David was not just dealing with the few
people and, and, and again, we can handle

00:10:09.465 --> 00:10:11.975
circumstances where one thing goes wrong.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.090
One person may not like us that's easy.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.050
But what he was saying was there's not
just a few people who are against me.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.560
There are many who are
increasing daily against me.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.320
This was a king who had everybody for him.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.830
It seemed like before he was over
everyone, everybody loved him.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.000
He was a man after God's own heart.

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:33.600
And now there are all these people,
all these things that are going

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.130
against him every single day.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.140
See he was.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.890
So desperate for God to move.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.210
He was in such a desperate place.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:42.870
He felt alone.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.570
Has anybody ever felt alone in a
certain situation where you feel

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.050
like nobody cares and it really
let's just go to the extent of it.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.370
You feel like God doesn't care.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.370
I mean, I think David's in this situation
where he is just, ah, he's just defeated.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.410
He's lost everything.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.030
And so I know all of us have probably
felt like that, right where we're

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.090
alone and we're defeated and, and
we feel like everybody's against.

00:11:07.005 --> 00:11:09.795
and I begin to realize this is maybe
it's not everybody's against us.

00:11:09.795 --> 00:11:11.084
And this is why it's so key.

00:11:11.895 --> 00:11:14.145
It's maybe not people, but
it's the circumstances.

00:11:14.145 --> 00:11:16.574
And I would even say that there is
an enemy out there that is trying

00:11:16.574 --> 00:11:20.895
to deceive us this, trying to use
everything in our lives to think that

00:11:20.895 --> 00:11:24.375
everyone's against us or everything
is against us, everything in life.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.714
And this is why I remind
myself of Ephesians six, 12.

00:11:27.015 --> 00:11:30.464
It says for our struggle is not
against flesh and blood, but against

00:11:30.464 --> 00:11:33.765
the rulers against the authorities
against the cosmic powers of darkness

00:11:33.765 --> 00:11:35.324
against evil, spiritual forces in.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.719
So as a believer, and I wanna, I wanna
speak here as a believer, we have an

00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:44.610
enemy that is trying to destroy the
work that God is doing in our lives.

00:11:44.849 --> 00:11:48.120
And if he is trying to destroy
those things, he will use every

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.189
circumstance and every person.

00:11:50.339 --> 00:11:52.829
And let me just go a little bit further,
which is where I tend to struggle.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.819
Every thought that I have in my
mind to make it negative, to make

00:11:56.819 --> 00:11:58.349
it think like, you know what.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.760
Nobody cares.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.080
Nothing's going right.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.310
I don't have enough.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.630
I'm never gonna make enough.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.070
I'm never gonna be healthy enough.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.300
I'm never gonna this.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:06.690
Right.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.550
And you begin to just self defeat.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.660
See, I have to remember just like
David has to remember this situation.

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:17.280
We're gonna see this, that this is
the enemy trying to steal something

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.710
from us, trying to still joy from.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.150
So there may be days that you believe
there's no hope or help for you in God.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.630
And that's what we see here in verse
two, he says many say about me.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.790
There is no help for him and God.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.910
Imagine this king David, a
man after God's own heart.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.540
And all these people are saying,
God can't even help him, man.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.800
That is defeating.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:39.870
That is defeating.

00:12:41.025 --> 00:12:44.084
So, whether we may even ask these
questions when we're going through

00:12:44.084 --> 00:12:48.525
difficult circumstances, why me, God,
again, I asked the question earlier,

00:12:48.525 --> 00:12:51.224
do you ever look around and go, the
grass is greener on the other side?

00:12:51.375 --> 00:12:51.824
Why not?

00:12:51.824 --> 00:12:52.755
Then they don't love Jesus.

00:12:52.755 --> 00:12:53.564
Like I love Jesus.

00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:56.655
They don't give, like I give,
they don't serve, like I serve.

00:12:57.135 --> 00:12:59.385
So we begin to just ask those questions.

00:13:00.255 --> 00:13:01.334
So here's the thing though.

00:13:01.334 --> 00:13:06.285
And this is where I love how David
begins to build this up, whether

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.494
our own consequences of our sin
or just the sins of the world.

00:13:10.485 --> 00:13:13.875
We may be going through these
feelings of defeat and loneliness,

00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:15.195
but they're not from God.

00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:17.745
Think back just like for David, right?

00:13:17.805 --> 00:13:22.515
God forgave David, before all this stuff
happened, the forgiveness was already

00:13:22.515 --> 00:13:27.165
given to David and he was dealing with
the consequences of his sins, but God

00:13:27.165 --> 00:13:28.785
never left him in the midst of that.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.755
So we can feel lonely in our battles.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.965
And again, this doesn't mean that what
you're going through is a consequence

00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:36.315
of your sin, but I wanna make this.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:42.120
When we are going through battles in life,
they're a consequence of some thing, some

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:48.690
sin, why we are living in a broken world
that is full of sinful things that are

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.830
not necessarily because of your result,
but just the result of sin in general.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.150
So in essence, everything that's going
on in our lives, the is a result of sin.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.110
Just, just to be clear here,
but we sometimes feel lonely

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.270
as though God is not with us.

00:14:04.305 --> 00:14:07.545
But we can't forget that godd has
promised not to leave her forakis

00:14:07.545 --> 00:14:08.685
and this is what I love about this.

00:14:08.895 --> 00:14:11.655
You, you see this little word at
the end of verse two at the end of

00:14:11.655 --> 00:14:15.495
verse four, and at the end of verse
eight, it's called Salla where you

00:14:15.495 --> 00:14:16.845
can say it a couple different ways.

00:14:17.535 --> 00:14:20.415
Many, explain it this way.

00:14:20.415 --> 00:14:25.155
Salla is a Hebrew word,
referring to a voluntary or

00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:27.495
intentional pause for reflect.

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:30.585
An intentional pause for reflection.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.575
So we're gonna look at it this way.

00:14:31.965 --> 00:14:33.525
David is crying out to God.

00:14:33.525 --> 00:14:34.455
I'm gonna read this again.

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:36.765
Lord, how my foes have increased.

00:14:36.975 --> 00:14:40.005
There are many who attack
me many say about me.

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:42.675
There is no help for him in God.

00:14:42.945 --> 00:14:44.175
And he begins to pause.

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:50.355
He begins to think on it and
he's thinking, man, is this true?

00:14:51.105 --> 00:14:52.965
Is there no help for me in God?

00:14:54.015 --> 00:14:59.370
And in this moment, David is
feeling everything you felt in those

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.110
moments when you felt defeated.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.560
David is feeling those moments
where you feel like there is

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.120
no hope and there is no help.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.580
He is pausing and reflecting on that.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.500
But here's the beautiful part.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:18.750
This pause to reflect allowed David to
reflect on truths that God had given him.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.120
And so I wanna, I wanna continue
to repeat this because I

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.500
believe this is so important.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.060
I feel like I'm my own worst.

00:15:24.885 --> 00:15:29.145
The things I think on, I begin
to be a negative reflection.

00:15:29.685 --> 00:15:32.355
Again, you may not be that person,
but I tend to do that, but our

00:15:32.355 --> 00:15:34.815
lives are heading in the direction
of our strongest thoughts.

00:15:35.295 --> 00:15:39.195
See, David's life could have taken one of
two turns at this moment, before we move

00:15:39.195 --> 00:15:42.615
on, it could have taken a major downturn.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.865
He could have rejected God and said, God,
I'm giving up because you have left me.

00:15:48.105 --> 00:15:48.885
You've left me here.

00:15:48.885 --> 00:15:50.565
My son is trying to destroy me.

00:15:50.565 --> 00:15:51.825
He's taken the kingdom away from me.

00:15:51.975 --> 00:15:54.225
I am done or.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.700
David could reflect and remember
everything that God had done for him.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.770
And that's just what David did.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:02.430
So let's look at this.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:05.640
How did David respond to his
circumstances with a desperate plea

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.500
and then with a powerful reminder?

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.550
So in verses three and four, it says,
but you Lord are a shield around

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:18.030
me, my glory, the one who lifts my
head, I cry aloud to the Lord and he

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.580
answers me from his holy mountain.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.290
So you look at this in verse
three, but you, this is a

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.930
powerful transition by David.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.730
It's really an about face, right?

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:34.230
It reminds me of second Corinthians five
17, where it says, therefore, if anyone

00:16:34.235 --> 00:16:36.090
is in Christ, he has a new creation.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.920
The old things have passed away.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.970
See the new has come see David in
that moment, put his foot in the

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.370
sand and he did not go towards.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.110
Running from God.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.610
He did not go towards negative self
doubt and all these negative feelings.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.160
He turned from it and
said, no, it's not true.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.450
I do have a help.

00:16:54.455 --> 00:16:55.380
And a hope from God.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.100
He is a shield all around me.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.230
The Lord is a shield.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:02.400
What does that mean?

00:17:02.405 --> 00:17:06.630
A shield is a protection or armor
defense, but as a verb, it means

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.329
to protect or guard or defend.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.720
So think about this God for David.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:17.790
Was a shield or a guard all
around him while his enemies

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.050
were trying to defeat him.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:24.359
When, when we see God's word and we
see that God is giving David this

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:29.460
shield, we can sit there and know
this, that God has given you a shield.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.980
God has been your protector and
will continue to protect you.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.800
And here is the greatest
part, and this is what I love.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.360
Every one of us have weaknesses.

00:17:39.365 --> 00:17:40.260
You guys have weaknesses.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:40.680
There's things.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.160
You're not good.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.360
There's things.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.090
It seems like, again, I tell you
mine's, mine's negative talk, right?

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.310
When we're talking about our
circumstances, it's the negative

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:51.780
talk for you and maybe other things,
but that weak part that I struggle

00:17:51.785 --> 00:17:53.820
with, God's a shield there too.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.460
God's not just a shield where I'm strong.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.000
He's actually a shield
everywhere, everywhere.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.700
And I realized where I am weak.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.150
He is strong and see David, a
man after God's own heart needed,

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:11.250
God's shield all around him to
protect him for all of his enemies.

00:18:12.135 --> 00:18:14.955
We need that same thing.

00:18:15.105 --> 00:18:18.675
David was now remembering
that God was that shield.

00:18:18.705 --> 00:18:19.365
Think about this.

00:18:19.365 --> 00:18:22.545
David had been through many
battles and been successful.

00:18:22.755 --> 00:18:26.625
The shield that God provided in
those battles is the same shield that

00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:28.305
God was providing in this battle.

00:18:29.129 --> 00:18:30.929
So I, I want to challenge you in this.

00:18:30.929 --> 00:18:31.800
I don't know.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.129
And I, I really don't know if God
has ever showed up for you before and

00:18:35.129 --> 00:18:36.389
has been a powerful shift for you.

00:18:36.389 --> 00:18:40.649
But if he has, if God has showed up
financially, if God has showed up

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.679
from a health standpoint, if God's
showed up and has given you peace or

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:47.399
patience in some circumstance, that
is something you can clinging to.

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:51.330
That is something you can grab hold of, to
remember in the difficult circumstances,

00:18:51.335 --> 00:18:54.540
when you feel like everybody's against
you or yourself is against you.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.149
And you can know that God.

00:18:58.065 --> 00:19:00.075
Is a shield and a protector.

00:19:00.225 --> 00:19:01.935
He is one that has hope.

00:19:02.235 --> 00:19:05.685
He is one that help can help
us overcome these situations.

00:19:05.745 --> 00:19:09.524
And when we begin to look at the
root of it to overcome the enemy,

00:19:09.825 --> 00:19:13.725
the enemy wants to still kill and
destroy anything good in your life.

00:19:13.725 --> 00:19:14.295
Why?

00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:18.855
Because it will cause you to doubt
in your faith, but God is good.

00:19:19.485 --> 00:19:20.925
God is faithful.

00:19:21.045 --> 00:19:22.605
And this is exactly what David.

00:19:23.445 --> 00:19:28.544
And it says this not only is God his
shield, but it says that God is his glory.

00:19:28.844 --> 00:19:29.774
What does that mean?

00:19:29.985 --> 00:19:32.534
That God is our praise or was his praise?

00:19:32.655 --> 00:19:37.064
He's one to be worshiped, a place
to trust and to have faith in.

00:19:37.544 --> 00:19:40.965
See, I can only worship something
that I believe in and I trust in.

00:19:41.564 --> 00:19:45.794
So what David is doing here is he's
beginning to say this, my glory,

00:19:45.794 --> 00:19:48.495
my worth my praise, my trust.

00:19:48.495 --> 00:19:51.254
My faith is in God alone.

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:54.495
I need this shield around me.

00:19:55.155 --> 00:19:57.465
And then he begins to speak about
something that I think really

00:19:57.465 --> 00:19:58.575
speaks directly to my heart.

00:20:00.345 --> 00:20:00.735
Um, right.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.735
The back end of verse three, it
says he is not only my glory, but

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.835
he is the one that lifts my head up.

00:20:06.555 --> 00:20:06.765
Guys.

00:20:06.765 --> 00:20:11.085
There are days where it feels
like my head is always hanging.

00:20:11.985 --> 00:20:13.005
I feel so defeated.

00:20:13.005 --> 00:20:16.695
You know, this, anybody ever played
in a sports sporting competition and

00:20:16.695 --> 00:20:19.005
you lost, what do you typically do?

00:20:19.005 --> 00:20:20.065
What's the first thing you do.

00:20:20.564 --> 00:20:22.095
Hang your head in defeat.

00:20:22.784 --> 00:20:23.595
You were done.

00:20:24.495 --> 00:20:24.975
I remember.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.264
Let me just give you a great example here.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:30.675
I remember whenever I was in high school,
my grandparents drove, I say a decent

00:20:30.679 --> 00:20:35.145
way to come see me play soccer and we
lost the game and I wouldn't talk to my

00:20:35.145 --> 00:20:39.405
grandparents, hung my head walked off from
them and they were pretty disappointed to

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:40.725
me cuz I was pretty much acting like a.

00:20:41.595 --> 00:20:42.285
right.

00:20:42.495 --> 00:20:46.155
But in those moments, guys,
we are hanging our head.

00:20:46.155 --> 00:20:49.995
When, when we feel defeated, when we feel
like our circumstances are difficult,

00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:53.355
we hang our head, but God says this.

00:20:53.745 --> 00:20:55.875
He is the one who lifts our head.

00:20:56.835 --> 00:21:00.615
See, I, I I'm envisioning this
Psalm as Dave is writing it.

00:21:00.615 --> 00:21:02.145
And I, I, I love the picture.

00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:04.445
David starts down on his niece.

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:07.784
He starts with his head
bowed and his eyes closed.

00:21:07.784 --> 00:21:11.715
And he is crying out to God because
he is casting his cares upon the Lord.

00:21:12.465 --> 00:21:15.885
And I believe in verse three
is when David begins to sit up.

00:21:16.544 --> 00:21:20.595
And when David begins to, to lift
his head up and recognize that

00:21:20.595 --> 00:21:21.915
the Lord is a shield around him.

00:21:22.034 --> 00:21:24.735
And by the end of this Psalm, I
believe David is standing up and

00:21:24.735 --> 00:21:28.125
he is praising and worshiping the
Lord because of what God has done

00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:30.345
to him, for him and through him.

00:21:30.735 --> 00:21:32.385
See, that's the God we serve.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.790
Because I look at this and I
need to be reminded just as

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.340
David is that God is for us.

00:21:38.879 --> 00:21:39.780
God is for us.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.750
Even in our most Dickel
circumstances, God is for us.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.920
So he lifts our head up.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.340
He reminds us that he is the sustainer,
the provider and the protector.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:52.620
And then we see in verse four, David
says, I cry out loud to the Lord.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.389
Yes, men, you can cry.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.970
Did, did you know that men, you can cry.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.270
Now you may think this is just
like a scream, but no, I believe

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.950
this is a desperate cry to the.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.620
I crowd to the Lord and he
answers me from his holy mountain.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.050
Let me ask this question.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:13.890
How confident are you that
God hears your prayers?

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.060
Are you confident?

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.730
There's times I'm not.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.110
Can, can I sit with you?

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.400
There's times I pray and
I'm like, you don't hear it.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:24.870
You don't care.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:31.410
So if you feel that way, welcome to
the club, but how do we overcome that?

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.360
How do we overcome that by seeing
when God does hear prayers by

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:41.340
remembering when God did provide,
I I'm just gonna spitball here.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.590
Courtney, Ryan, God provided got
a job now that was a long prayer

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:47.970
and a long, difficult road.

00:22:47.975 --> 00:22:48.540
Right.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.100
But God answered.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:54.430
Remember that when you're going through
difficult circumstances, remember

00:22:54.435 --> 00:22:57.150
that Doug, both cars breaking down.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.400
God provide you guys got a new car.

00:22:59.939 --> 00:23:02.850
God provided you were
desperate in that situation.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:04.679
I can go around this room.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.199
I don't know all y'all so deep,
but I can continue to go around

00:23:07.199 --> 00:23:09.929
this room and you guys will
remember and sorry to call you two.

00:23:09.935 --> 00:23:11.070
I just, this came to mind.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:11.310
Okay.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.550
But God will use those circumstances.

00:23:15.435 --> 00:23:18.585
When you cried out and you're
saying, God, show up God, show up.

00:23:18.615 --> 00:23:19.515
Here's what God does.

00:23:19.515 --> 00:23:21.795
God hears us from his holy mountain.

00:23:21.795 --> 00:23:25.935
God is not a God that sits up there
and desires for life to suck for us.

00:23:25.995 --> 00:23:27.045
I'm sorry for using that word.

00:23:27.255 --> 00:23:30.405
God, isn't that God, he doesn't
look down and say, I hope your life.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.035
Isn't good.

00:23:31.425 --> 00:23:32.295
You know what God is.

00:23:32.295 --> 00:23:33.405
God is compassionate.

00:23:33.405 --> 00:23:37.575
God, God is so compassionate
that he fills your needs before

00:23:37.575 --> 00:23:38.505
you even know you need them.

00:23:39.015 --> 00:23:40.155
He knows it.

00:23:40.935 --> 00:23:44.385
And if God knows you have that
need, he desires for you to meet it.

00:23:44.535 --> 00:23:47.235
But at times you wonder
why did it take so long?

00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:49.035
Why does it happen to happen this way?

00:23:49.125 --> 00:23:53.745
And I'll just tell you this until we leave
this broken world, we'll never experience

00:23:53.745 --> 00:23:56.355
a perfect time for what we would desire.

00:23:56.355 --> 00:23:56.835
Right.

00:23:56.895 --> 00:23:59.865
But God's, timing's perfect because
he's not only here to redeem you.

00:24:00.735 --> 00:24:04.185
He's here to redeem the whole world and
he's here to redeem the whole world.

00:24:04.185 --> 00:24:08.025
Sometimes your longer suffering is
not for your benefit necessarily, but

00:24:08.025 --> 00:24:11.325
for the benefit of others around you
see somebody needs to hear that today.

00:24:11.835 --> 00:24:14.475
Somebody needs to hear that
sometimes the longer that you're

00:24:14.475 --> 00:24:17.635
suffering and struggling is not
necessarily for your benefit.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.480
Because it would be better for you to
get it over with, but for somebody else's

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.870
so that they can see Jesus work through
your suffering because they're suffering.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:27.840
And they can know just like
David, that God was present.

00:24:27.899 --> 00:24:31.740
Even in the midst of all the enemies
around him, he was a shield guys.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.360
This is difficult at times to
understand our circumstances.

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.990
But David reminds us that
God does hear our prayers.

00:24:40.139 --> 00:24:42.450
God does hear our prayers.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:46.080
When we humbly come before God and
prayer, we know that our prayers are.

00:24:46.844 --> 00:24:48.735
We know that they're heard.

00:24:50.054 --> 00:24:53.745
We can know that God is again, not
sitting by enjoying that we're suffering.

00:24:53.745 --> 00:24:55.274
No, God is compassionate.

00:24:56.175 --> 00:24:58.814
So David went to God and
prayer with confidence.

00:24:59.475 --> 00:25:04.125
And when we pray, God's promises over our
lives, we can know without a shadow of

00:25:04.125 --> 00:25:08.895
doubt that God will hear us God desires
to, to work in and through our lives

00:25:09.135 --> 00:25:13.875
to use every circumstance for our good,
his glory, for the benefit of others.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:19.170
See, there's been moments in my life where
I've sat there and I've cried out to the

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.880
Lord and I've asked that same question.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.280
You've asked God, what are you doing?

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.230
What are you doing?

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:30.810
And at times I feel like God is
silent, but what do I keep doing?

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:37.500
I remember how God has provided over
and over and over again for our family,

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.600
for our church, for those around us.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.730
And I go, you know what,
my God hurt me in that.

00:25:43.155 --> 00:25:46.665
now he may not be answering right
now the way I want, but God is

00:25:46.665 --> 00:25:51.465
doing something in this circumstance
for me, for those around us.

00:25:51.885 --> 00:25:53.295
So here's my encouragement to you.

00:25:53.475 --> 00:25:55.095
Just like David cried out to God.

00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:58.485
Just like I talked about that
at times I cry out to God

00:25:58.485 --> 00:25:59.985
and I'm getting angry at God.

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:01.845
Do you know that God can handle that?

00:26:03.105 --> 00:26:04.935
It's okay to be real with God.

00:26:05.265 --> 00:26:06.225
You wanna know why?

00:26:06.495 --> 00:26:10.320
Because if you don't voice it,
He already knows your heart.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:11.100
He already knows.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.300
If you're angry, just tell
him out loud he can handle it.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.710
Why is that good?

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:21.060
Because if you don't say it out
loud, you begin to get in your head

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:23.640
and your life is heading in the
direction of your strongest thoughts.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.010
And when you begin to think
on that, God doesn't care.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.810
You're gonna take the wrong step.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:28.980
See David took the right one.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.180
You're gonna take the wrong one.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.250
You're gonna end it verse two, and
you're gonna go, you know what?

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.220
There is no help for me
from God, God doesn't care.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.180
Forget this.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.640
But no, no, no, no.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.040
Tell God, get it out.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.470
Tell a friend, let them encourage you.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.910
Let them build you up.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.680
Don't let the enemy win.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.020
And this is where we see David setting.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.640
That great example he is being real.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:53.640
So at the end of verse four,
we see the word Sayah again.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:59.580
So David begins to pause again, to
take a moment to remember the truths

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.610
he was rejecting lies from verse two.

00:27:03.419 --> 00:27:04.679
That there was no help for him.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.389
And he was proclaiming truths.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.290
So he began to think on those
truths to give him peace and

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.090
rest again, picture this.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:15.419
David started out on his knees
with his head bowed down.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:17.040
He is desperate before the Lord.

00:27:17.129 --> 00:27:20.730
He begins to sit up his head
raises up and I begin, this is

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.020
in verse five, going forward.

00:27:22.024 --> 00:27:25.169
We begin to see David get up off
the ground and begin to worship.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.590
So how did David respond to
circumstances with a desperate

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:32.550
plea, with a powerful reminder
and with victory over his enemies?

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.530
So let's see how this
works out in verse five.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:40.920
It says I lie down to sleep and I wake
up again because the Lord sustains me.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.380
Anybody struggle to sleep because
of all the stress in their life.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:44.760
Okay.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.080
Maybe I'm the only one, right?

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.810
We, we struggle to go to sleep and
we wake up in the middle of the night

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.840
and we're trying to solve all the
problems and then we wake up exhausted

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.740
and then it just runs the rest of.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:59.670
see David gets this, but David
said after he began to proclaim

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.720
these truths, he said, I lie down
to sleep and I wake up again and I

00:28:03.725 --> 00:28:05.310
realize that the Lord sustained me.

00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:11.370
See, you wanna know why God created rest
because he had to take something out

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.399
of our hands where we wouldn't try to
figure out out how to solve problems,

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:18.720
because at the moment of rest that's
when only God can work and you can't.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.010
So every time you take a nap, which,
so that means it's, it's a blessing

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.030
to take a nap, take more naps.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.100
I mean, it's, let's God
more control your life.

00:28:26.429 --> 00:28:28.260
I'll take one this
afternoon just to prove it.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:28.860
Okay.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:34.590
But when we are sleeping, we can't control
anything and God controls everything.

00:28:35.129 --> 00:28:39.060
So we see here that David laid down when
he had all this stress, he's wondering,

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.199
are they gonna come and attack me?

00:28:40.199 --> 00:28:41.129
Are they gonna find me?

00:28:42.209 --> 00:28:44.310
And he says, he wakes up and the Lord.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:45.930
Sustain me.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.630
He found rest in God's Providence.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.980
He was able to wake up knowing that
the Lord would defeat his enemies.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.610
No matter if they were all around
him, God would defeat his enemies.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:00.330
Even the unknown circumstances
that we have in our lives.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:05.430
I'm telling you this, there are so
many things to fear in our lives, but

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.080
God has not given us a spirit of fear.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.560
He's given us a spirit of power
and love and a sound mind, and

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.740
we need to continue to cleaning.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:16.410
. So then we see in verse six, he says, I
will not be afraid of a thousand people

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.510
who have taken up their stand against me.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:19.530
On every side.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.570
He woke up in confidence, knowing
that no matter how many people, no

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:28.710
matter how many circumstances to seem
to be weighed against him in that

00:29:28.715 --> 00:29:31.710
moment, that he would not be afraid.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.940
You know, I, I would like to
say as a man, I'm not afraid of.

00:29:36.885 --> 00:29:38.925
But I'm, I'm getting as I get older.

00:29:38.925 --> 00:29:38.985
Yeah.

00:29:39.075 --> 00:29:41.415
I'm, I'm more afraid
of big roller coasters.

00:29:41.415 --> 00:29:42.284
I don't like those.

00:29:42.645 --> 00:29:45.794
Um, I'm really afraid of snakes,
so never let me see a snake or

00:29:45.794 --> 00:29:46.815
all scream like a little girl.

00:29:48.524 --> 00:29:51.465
And there's a lot of circumstances where
I'm afraid, but I don't tell people

00:29:51.675 --> 00:29:53.024
because I feel like it's not manly.

00:29:53.804 --> 00:29:57.075
And there's sometimes you guys
may feel afraid and you feel

00:29:57.075 --> 00:29:59.235
like it's not Christian to
tell people that you're afraid.

00:30:01.095 --> 00:30:01.605
Did you know that?

00:30:01.605 --> 00:30:02.475
It's it's okay.

00:30:02.475 --> 00:30:04.665
At times that feel afraid.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:11.580
And to wonder if it's gonna work
out, is God gonna come through it's

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:16.230
at times we wonder that, but this
is where we have to remind ourselves

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.149
of the truth that God gives us.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:22.530
David woke up and it didn't matter
if there was a thousand men outside

00:30:22.534 --> 00:30:25.649
of him, he could stand up against
them because God was his shield.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.060
We too, can wake up with that
confidence, despite things like

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.090
this, despite wondering if we're
gonna make it financially, despite

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:36.060
wondering if the job you're working
is going to ever get better.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:39.240
Despite wondering if that one person
in your life is going to betray

00:30:39.245 --> 00:30:42.030
you stop wondering if the negative
thoughts that you have about yourself

00:30:42.035 --> 00:30:43.170
is gonna tear you down again.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.560
Stop wondering if, if you'll just
make the right decisions, are

00:30:46.565 --> 00:30:47.550
you gonna make a mistake again?

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:52.050
You fill in the blank, despite all
those thousands of things around you,

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.810
you do not have to be afraid of people.

00:30:55.275 --> 00:30:57.735
Of the enemy of any
circumstance around you.

00:30:57.795 --> 00:31:02.535
And that's why I remind myself of second
Timothy one seven over and over again for

00:31:02.535 --> 00:31:07.275
God has not given you a spirit of fear,
but of power and love and sound judgment.

00:31:07.605 --> 00:31:10.905
Guys, I talk so much about what
God has given us, but you need

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.015
to write this down somewhere.

00:31:12.165 --> 00:31:13.725
God has not given you.

00:31:14.304 --> 00:31:16.284
Not giving you a spirit of fear.

00:31:16.405 --> 00:31:19.705
So when you worry, when you fear,
when you wonder what somebody

00:31:19.705 --> 00:31:23.334
thinks of you or what they don't
think of you, it doesn't matter.

00:31:23.365 --> 00:31:26.754
God has not given that to you and
you need to repeat it to yourself so

00:31:26.754 --> 00:31:28.885
that you do not let the enemy win.

00:31:29.155 --> 00:31:31.405
And this is where it gets great.

00:31:32.245 --> 00:31:35.185
This is where it gets great, because I
believe at this point David's standing up.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:40.380
He's standing up because God sustained
him when he slept and he's awake and he's

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.700
standing up and he's like, I don't care.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.430
If there's a thousand people
around me, I'm not gonna be afraid.

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.010
I'm gonna take my stand against them.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:55.500
And this is the fun part he says in
verse seven, rise up, Lord, save me.

00:31:55.505 --> 00:31:58.860
My God, man.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.560
That's good.

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:02.880
I needed to hear that.

00:32:04.035 --> 00:32:08.565
Rise up, Lord, save me.

00:32:08.565 --> 00:32:10.065
My God guys.

00:32:10.065 --> 00:32:12.135
That's not something you
just pray at salvation.

00:32:13.305 --> 00:32:16.035
That's something that we
have to pray every day.

00:32:16.125 --> 00:32:20.625
We have to believe every day that
the Lord rises up and that he

00:32:20.625 --> 00:32:22.995
saves us from the self defeating.

00:32:22.995 --> 00:32:28.035
Talk to the enemies around us, to the,
the circumstances that we have around

00:32:28.035 --> 00:32:32.805
us, because my God can defeat my enemies.

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:39.660
David had so much confidence that
God could defeat his enemies.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.410
What did he say?

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.910
He even told God how to do it.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.610
He says, you strike all my
enemies on the cheek and you

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.649
break the teeth of the wicked.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:50.580
See, David begin to remember, let's
go back to the last section here.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:51.870
David begin to remember.

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:56.760
He is visually seen God use him and
his army to do this exact same thing.

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:59.340
To strike his enemies on the cheek
and to break the teeth of the.

00:33:00.524 --> 00:33:03.195
David is not thinking of something new.

00:33:03.195 --> 00:33:05.565
He's really just remembering
what God has already done.

00:33:05.685 --> 00:33:07.425
And he's just telling God to do it again.

00:33:08.115 --> 00:33:08.925
Just do it again.

00:33:08.925 --> 00:33:12.345
Lord rise up and defeat my enemies.

00:33:15.014 --> 00:33:16.545
This is a great time to just get honest.

00:33:16.545 --> 00:33:19.155
What enemies are you facing right now?

00:33:19.245 --> 00:33:20.264
What are you struggling with?

00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:22.035
I'd love for a couple people to share.

00:33:22.035 --> 00:33:23.085
What are you struggling with?

00:33:23.625 --> 00:33:28.145
What circumstances around you are
you dealing with, who wants to share.

00:33:32.969 --> 00:33:33.899
Negative thoughts.

00:33:33.899 --> 00:33:34.260
Amen.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.850
Sister, what else?

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:38.310
What are you struggling with?

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.550
And I'm glad nobody's
struggling around here.

00:33:50.939 --> 00:33:51.540
Absolutely.

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.679
Wondering if it's ever gonna end.

00:33:53.129 --> 00:33:54.120
Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:54.840
What else?

00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:59.460
Sleep?

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:00.690
Yes.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:02.070
What else?

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:10.230
What enemies, what circumstances
are you facing right now that you're

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.420
asking the Lord to rise up and defeat?

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.390
Yes.

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:22.470
Consistency in your faith.

00:34:26.175 --> 00:34:28.965
Guys here's here's, here's what I would
challenge you with, cuz I know you guys

00:34:28.965 --> 00:34:30.705
probably are a lot like me in class.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.404
You don't wanna give the wrong
answer, but then, uh, usually the

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:35.745
professor says there's no wrong
answers until you give the wrong

00:34:35.745 --> 00:34:37.634
answer, but there isn't wrong answer.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:40.275
So here's my challenge for you,
cuz I know you didn't engage in all

00:34:40.275 --> 00:34:44.324
that as much, much as I wanted to,
but there is something in your life

00:34:45.554 --> 00:34:50.654
that you need to give over to God
and ask God to rise up and defeat.

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.190
The enemy, the circumstance in your life.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:57.330
He, he has promised to provide
for David to defeat those enemies.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:03.210
And he will for you, you need to start
thinking about what is in your life

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:06.660
for God to rise up and defeat, because
you may think it's too big for God.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:11.850
And God's gonna say, Uhuh, there's
nothing too big or too small for me

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:18.390
to take and to rise up and to save
you from whatever enemy circumstance.

00:35:19.305 --> 00:35:23.355
And I know this there's many of you that
have seen God provide for you in the past.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.995
And I challenge you to write those
things down, put them up on your

00:35:25.995 --> 00:35:30.705
fridge to remember when you are having
difficult circumstances to think back

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:36.885
on, to know that God will fight for
you, that God will rise up and save you.

00:35:37.774 --> 00:35:39.435
And I love verse eight.

00:35:39.674 --> 00:35:41.205
He says salvation.

00:35:41.265 --> 00:35:43.665
And in other words for
our salvation is victory.

00:35:44.055 --> 00:35:45.585
Victory belongs to the Lord.

00:35:45.795 --> 00:35:49.004
May your blessings be on all your people?

00:35:50.055 --> 00:35:52.754
Salvation and victory belongs to the Lord.

00:35:52.995 --> 00:35:58.785
David reminded himself and us
that true victory is found in God.

00:35:58.995 --> 00:35:59.924
Can I go a step further?

00:35:59.924 --> 00:36:01.575
Because in this time, Jesus, wasn't there.

00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:04.785
True victory is found in Jesus.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:07.650
God.

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:08.610
So loved you.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:12.270
He was so compassionate about
you, that he knew you couldn't

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.040
make it without Jesus being sin.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:21.240
So he is sin Jesus for you to fight for
you to claim victory for you in your

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.220
circumstances against all of your enemies.

00:36:25.395 --> 00:36:27.015
That's what he has come to do.

00:36:27.015 --> 00:36:31.875
That's why we come every Sunday to remind
ourselves who God is, so that we can go

00:36:32.025 --> 00:36:33.585
and we can live that and experience that.

00:36:33.585 --> 00:36:35.625
And we can help others experience that.

00:36:35.625 --> 00:36:38.265
And I'm so thankful that David
wrote this song because I'm not

00:36:38.265 --> 00:36:40.545
the only one that struggles.

00:36:40.875 --> 00:36:43.035
I'm not the only one that
feels like there's thousands

00:36:43.035 --> 00:36:44.145
of enemies all around me.

00:36:44.725 --> 00:36:47.295
I'm not the only one that has
difficult circumstances in my life.

00:36:47.445 --> 00:36:52.065
And David has given me
the example to follow.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:58.230
See, I started writing this section of
the message and I listen to music a lot

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:02.640
of times when I write messages and this
song came on and I love how God divinely

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.470
intervenes with music, I love music.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:07.800
Um, and this is, this is the
song and I'm not gonna sing it

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.110
cuz you guys would be horribly.

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:11.070
Yeah.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.520
So it's, it's called see a victory.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.790
And so he says this, this is the song.

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.940
I'm not gonna sing all of it, but
it says the weapon may be formed.

00:37:21.975 --> 00:37:28.544
But it won't prosper when the
darkness falls, it won't prevail.

00:37:29.774 --> 00:37:33.615
Cause the God I serve
knows only how to triumph.

00:37:34.605 --> 00:37:36.615
My God will never fail.

00:37:37.185 --> 00:37:39.134
Oh my God will never fail.

00:37:40.515 --> 00:37:42.075
He says, I'm gonna sing a victory.

00:37:43.125 --> 00:37:45.464
He says, I'm gonna see a
victory for the battle.

00:37:45.524 --> 00:37:46.714
Belongs to you, Lord.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.569
I'm gonna see a victory.

00:37:49.259 --> 00:37:51.690
I'm gonna see a victory for
the battle belongs to you.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:52.080
Lord.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.029
There's no power.

00:37:54.089 --> 00:37:54.690
Excuse me.

00:37:55.259 --> 00:37:57.540
There is power in the
mighty name of Jesus.

00:37:58.049 --> 00:38:00.600
Every war he wages, he will win.

00:38:01.529 --> 00:38:03.750
I'm not backing down from any giant.

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:08.279
Look at that reference to David
cuz I know how this story ends.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:08.790
Yes.

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.379
I know how this story ends.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:11.700
I'm gonna see a victory.

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:13.020
Come on.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:14.640
I'm gonna see a victory.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.860
For the battle belongs to you, Lord.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.060
And I'm gonna just jump down here.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:22.259
He says, you take what the enemy meant
for evil and you turn it for good.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.060
You turn it for good.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.690
You take what the enemy meant
for evil and you turn it to good.

00:38:28.259 --> 00:38:31.860
These are the promises that we take with
us today into the battles that we are

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.140
facing and the enemies we are FAK facing.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:39.300
Guys, I don't know what you're walking
through and this may be for me.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.880
So I'll go home and say, thank you, Lord.

00:38:42.915 --> 00:38:45.345
and you guys take it for whatever
it's worth, because I know this

00:38:45.345 --> 00:38:46.575
message was important for me.

00:38:47.595 --> 00:38:52.785
I needed to see that my God fights
for me, even when I'm sleeping, that

00:38:52.785 --> 00:38:56.415
my God fights for me, even when the
circumstances that I'm dealing with,

00:38:56.535 --> 00:39:01.155
you may not deal with, but it's okay
because we're on the same team and we

00:39:01.155 --> 00:39:03.135
battle together and we work together.

00:39:04.335 --> 00:39:08.895
What's holding you back from keeping
the faith, despite your circumstances.

00:39:09.915 --> 00:39:12.105
I wanna give you a visual
image before we close today.

00:39:13.605 --> 00:39:14.805
This is where David started.

00:39:16.095 --> 00:39:16.935
He was desperate.

00:39:17.565 --> 00:39:22.605
God, my enemies are all around me.

00:39:23.745 --> 00:39:24.015
God.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:32.415
They say there's no help
in you, but God I know.

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:40.860
Gotta know, you're faithful.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:43.230
I know you're good.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.210
You hear my prayers?

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.870
God, I sleep and I wake
up and you sustain me.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:54.000
God.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:58.590
I realize no matter how many enemies,
no matter how many circumstances

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:01.800
that I face you are my shield

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:05.860
rise up, Lord.

00:40:07.335 --> 00:40:10.065
Rise up, Lord, save me.

00:40:10.725 --> 00:40:11.445
Be my victory.

00:40:13.815 --> 00:40:14.565
Be my victory.

00:40:15.375 --> 00:40:19.065
See David's story gives me the
confidence to keep the faith.

00:40:19.545 --> 00:40:24.915
Despite my circumstances, I pray
that David's story gives you

00:40:24.945 --> 00:40:28.425
the confidence, despite your
circumstances to keep the faith.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.010
He was a man after God's own heart.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:33.990
He made mistakes and had consequences.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.630
He had tough battles and he
faced enemies all around him.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.190
Yet he kept his faith.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:40.710
He rejected the lies that
there was no help for him.

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:44.670
And he moved from tears and
defeat to praise and victory.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.210
God has not given us a spirit of fear.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.470
And I want you to leave out with that
today to run with confidence that

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.510
Jesus gives us through salvation and.

00:40:57.674 --> 00:41:01.305
you know, as you've already seen today,
this message is deep and dear to my heart,

00:41:01.305 --> 00:41:03.345
God has shown up over and over again.

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:07.935
He wants to show up more, but my desire
is that God show up in your life,

00:41:09.165 --> 00:41:13.904
God desires to do more through you
and me than we can thank or imagine.

00:41:14.535 --> 00:41:17.745
And I'm just gonna start speaking
over the next couple of months.

00:41:17.745 --> 00:41:19.785
God is ready to do something in this.

00:41:21.615 --> 00:41:23.985
not just this location, even
though I think that's part of it.

00:41:24.015 --> 00:41:26.475
His people, everyone that's here today.

00:41:26.475 --> 00:41:28.875
God is ready to do something through you.

00:41:29.145 --> 00:41:35.165
And it's gonna start today that we let
all those things that, so hold us back.

00:41:35.835 --> 00:41:36.645
We get rid of them.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:40.485
We put our foot down and we turn
towards Jesus and we proclaim victory.

00:41:40.635 --> 00:41:41.835
We start getting involved.

00:41:41.835 --> 00:41:44.925
We start giving, we start
serving, we start inviting people.

00:41:44.985 --> 00:41:46.395
We start serving our community.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.235
Like we've never done.

00:41:47.235 --> 00:41:50.775
And we share the love and hope of Jesus
and the same thing we experience today,

00:41:50.775 --> 00:41:53.895
because there are so many people out
around us that need to experience.

00:41:56.235 --> 00:41:56.525
Amen.

00:41:57.585 --> 00:42:00.645
So what's stopping you
from experiencing that.

00:42:00.645 --> 00:42:01.215
I don't know.

00:42:01.275 --> 00:42:02.445
And this is why we have a ton of in.

00:42:03.525 --> 00:42:07.365
A time of invitation is for you
to seek the Lord and ask, what

00:42:07.365 --> 00:42:08.535
is it that's holding me back.

00:42:08.535 --> 00:42:13.035
What is it that I need to proclaim
victory over today for some of you

00:42:13.605 --> 00:42:15.705
that really truly could be salvation.

00:42:16.425 --> 00:42:21.915
Cuz David had a relationship with God
and that's what gave him victory, but

00:42:21.915 --> 00:42:23.985
you can't have victory without salvation.

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:27.735
So if you've never given your life to
Jesus, today is the day of salvation.

00:42:27.735 --> 00:42:30.435
Today is the day of victory over defeat.

00:42:30.855 --> 00:42:31.605
Over sin.

00:42:31.875 --> 00:42:33.825
So if you have questions about
what it means to give your

00:42:33.825 --> 00:42:35.625
life to Jesus, come see me.

00:42:35.625 --> 00:42:38.745
I'm gonna hang out in the back to an
invitation right after service, but God

00:42:38.745 --> 00:42:40.995
is ready to defeat the sin in your life.

00:42:41.924 --> 00:42:44.325
What is it that you need
to take next steps in?

00:42:44.325 --> 00:42:46.634
If you've already given your life
to Jesus, for some of you, it

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.714
could be baptism for some of you.

00:42:47.714 --> 00:42:48.795
It could be membership for some of you.

00:42:48.795 --> 00:42:51.585
It could just be getting more involved
in your community, your neighborhood

00:42:51.734 --> 00:42:53.595
sharing Jesus, showing the love of Jesus.

00:42:53.745 --> 00:42:55.515
I don't know what it is, but you do.

00:42:56.444 --> 00:43:00.165
So ask the Lord to give you the
faith to take that next step.

00:43:01.259 --> 00:43:02.459
And here's the cool part.

00:43:02.459 --> 00:43:04.020
We're a church that works together.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.020
So if you need help to take that
next step, that's what I'm here for.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.129
That's what Brittney's here for.

00:43:08.189 --> 00:43:09.180
That's what all of us are here for.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.520
So come and say, Hey, I
wanna take a next step.

00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:15.240
If you don't know what it is, come, we
can talk about it and figure that out.

00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:18.330
But God is doing something
in our city, in our church.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:19.740
I want you to be a part of it.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:20.850
I wanna be a part of it.

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:24.000
And today is a day that we get to put
our foot in the sand and start claiming

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.160
victory and experience it today in.

00:43:27.195 --> 00:43:28.395
Let me challenge you with this.

00:43:28.725 --> 00:43:33.975
Faith is seen what God sees, even
though you don't see it today, maybe

00:43:33.975 --> 00:43:36.585
you need to proclaim faith in something
that you haven't seen in your life.

00:43:36.765 --> 00:43:42.135
Haven't seen in this city, that one day
you'll experience with your physical eyes.

00:43:42.675 --> 00:43:46.605
And you'll get to remember when you
prayed and solve victory before you

00:43:46.605 --> 00:43:48.165
actually physically saw victory.

00:43:48.165 --> 00:43:51.975
I hope that made sense, but today, if
you need Jesus, come see me the day.

00:43:51.975 --> 00:43:54.795
If you need to take a next step
in your faith, do it during this

00:43:54.795 --> 00:43:56.145
time of invitation, give it to.

00:43:57.285 --> 00:43:57.915
Give it to God.

00:43:58.845 --> 00:43:59.355
Jesus.

00:43:59.355 --> 00:44:00.134
We love you.

00:44:00.645 --> 00:44:01.814
God, you are good.

00:44:02.145 --> 00:44:04.845
God, this Psalm is so good.

00:44:06.495 --> 00:44:11.084
The day we are claiming victory
over the areas of our lives.

00:44:11.084 --> 00:44:12.915
Lord, where we have had defeat.

00:44:13.365 --> 00:44:14.865
Lord, I give it over to you, Lord.

00:44:14.865 --> 00:44:15.435
I repent.

00:44:15.555 --> 00:44:19.035
I give over any fear and any struggle
that I've dealt with Lord, I prayed

00:44:19.035 --> 00:44:22.245
that each person in this room, Lord,
that they begin to give over into.

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:24.960
The things that they need to give
over to you, Lord the fear or

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.170
the sin or the struggle or the
defeat or the, whatever it is.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:30.990
Lord, I pray that every person in
this room begins to do that today.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.310
Lord, I pray that they are leaving
outta here, renewed in their faith.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:39.120
Lord, I pray that if there is someone in
this room that doesn't know you, Lord,

00:44:39.125 --> 00:44:44.400
that today will be the day of salvation
and they can celebrate with you and your

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.690
angels in heaven who are celebrating
over one sin who repent Lord, give them

00:44:48.695 --> 00:44:50.940
the faith to say yes to their next.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.900
God, we all need the faith from you.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.540
Renew us today in Jesus name.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.010
Amen.
