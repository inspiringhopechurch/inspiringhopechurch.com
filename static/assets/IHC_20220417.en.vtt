00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.270
Have you ever had something so
exciting or so important that it

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.810
couldn't wait, you had to run home
to tell somebody, get on the phone

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.700
and make sure you told them right.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.700
Then anybody had something that
important, that exciting that

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.170
they had to stop right then.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.440
Right.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.820
I would say a lot of us have the
one thing I think of if you had

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.910
a child and I would not even say,
Hey, we're heading to the hospital.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.200
I would even go back to
the moment you found.

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:30.375
It's that moment of like,
who am I going to call?

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:31.275
I got to stop right now.

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:32.894
I don't, I don't care
when it is who it is.

00:00:32.894 --> 00:00:33.795
We're going to make the phone call.

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:34.155
Right?

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:37.725
So many of you have had those moments
where it's this exciting message

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:40.485
or this something that's new in
your life or an important message.

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:40.845
Right?

00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:42.165
Hey, your house is on fire.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.075
I remember getting a phone call
and this is kind of off subject,

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:48.015
but I remember getting a phone call
at 3:00 AM when I used to be an

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:49.605
executive pastor back in Oklahoma.

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:53.504
And it was a student of our youth
ministry and he called me and he

00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:56.265
said, pastor, The church is on fire.

00:00:57.345 --> 00:00:59.834
I look at my phone, pick it back up.

00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:00.405
What?

00:01:01.035 --> 00:01:02.385
Yes, the church is on fire.

00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:03.194
Come to figure out.

00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:06.914
As I rushed there, um, our church
was on fire and half our church

00:01:06.914 --> 00:01:10.905
had been vandalized and set on
fire was kind of a crazy ordeal.

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:13.785
God used it for his glory and there
were some cool things that came out

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:17.715
of it, but that was an important
message to call the church was on fire.

00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:18.074
Right?

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:21.495
Um, well I say that all to say is today,
we're going to talk about a message.

00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:24.615
That was so important, but I want
to give you guys just another

00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:26.565
example in history about a message.

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:28.485
Anybody know who Paul Revere is?

00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:32.984
Anybody, what was Paul
Revere most known for?

00:01:33.044 --> 00:01:33.405
What was this?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.360
The British are coming now.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.720
Interesting.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.820
You begin to actually
process through this.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.289
There was a long journey to this.

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.690
Wasn't just like running and nonstop.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.120
There was a long journey where he was
saying the British were coming, right.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.500
He was going to warn the colonial
militia of the British invasion at

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.240
the battle of Lexington and Concord.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.910
This was setting up for
the war of independence.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:54.270
Right.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.070
But I started thinking through this.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.970
What if.

00:01:58.665 --> 00:01:59.535
Again, Paul Revere.

00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:00.195
Here's what we're talking about.

00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:02.745
What if Paul didn't take
the message serious?

00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:06.105
What if somebody told them the British
are coming and he goes, are you sure?

00:02:07.155 --> 00:02:07.905
Now here's another one.

00:02:07.905 --> 00:02:10.935
I started thinking through what if
he wasn't in a hurry to share the

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:12.135
message he's probably looking at, man.

00:02:12.135 --> 00:02:13.175
I saw I've got dinner tonight.

00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:16.335
I got to tuck in the kids
probably going to take a nap.

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:19.035
Uh, what else do I need
to do another thing?

00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:22.725
What if the message wasn't clear,
the British are coming sometime,

00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:25.995
maybe tomorrow, maybe next year
the British are coming sometime.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.180
And the last one I started thinking
through is what if he spent more time

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.960
when he was going on this journey
to get off his horse and say, man,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.940
that journey was so tough, man.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.760
My backside is really hurting me and
forgetting to tell the message, right?

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.020
He started focusing more on the difficulty
of the journey than on the message

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.640
as I began to think through that,
if those things would have happened,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.190
would we have independence today?

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.650
Would that war have actually
went the way it went.

00:02:53.445 --> 00:02:53.715
Right.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:55.455
I started thinking through those things.

00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:59.505
Well, today I think it's a challenge
from Paul, the apostle, not Paul Revere,

00:02:59.775 --> 00:03:01.365
Paul, the apostle and that same thing.

00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:04.155
So we're going to continue to the
first book of Timothy and Paul's

00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:08.985
urgency with this message of how the
church should conduct themselves.

00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:11.415
And there's going to be a
longer story to this really how

00:03:11.415 --> 00:03:12.435
we should conduct ourselves.

00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:12.945
Not only in the.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.220
But because the church has the
message of Jesus, the church

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.420
has the message of Jesus.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.160
And so why was it so an urgent, and this
is kind of catching you guys up on the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.410
story, the message that Paul has for these
believers that he's writing to is that

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.329
if they don't conduct themselves well,
the message of the gospel will not be.

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:37.165
That the church, actually, if we look
in the book of first Timothy, if you've

00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:40.615
been with us, you'll see that there was
some false teaching that was happening.

00:03:40.915 --> 00:03:43.075
So there would have been more false
teachers that rise up there would have

00:03:43.075 --> 00:03:46.735
been more people that were taken away from
the faith, the lead away from the faith,

00:03:46.735 --> 00:03:48.595
a lot more distractions in the church.

00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:52.645
So this message was critical and it was
critical that it went quickly and that

00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:54.445
it went effectively and efficiently.

00:03:55.165 --> 00:03:58.765
And so if our conduct is not worthy of
the message, when we think about this

00:03:58.945 --> 00:04:05.234
as Paul, uh, Then we are missing out
on the opportunity to really share with

00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:10.095
others, this message of the gospel, the
message of the gospel is too important

00:04:10.245 --> 00:04:14.295
to those around us to be half-hearted
and to allow it to become tainted by

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.035
our conduct and the way that we live.

00:04:16.334 --> 00:04:19.095
And this is just a challenge as we
jump into this, when we think about

00:04:19.095 --> 00:04:20.255
conduct is just really the way.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.380
The way that we live, and it's
not about perfection at all.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.940
It's really about consistency because
if Christ has changed your life, we're

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.980
going to consistently be able to show
others with our life and how we live

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.320
also within the church who Christ is.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.740
And so again, kind of catching
you up on where we've been,

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.599
Paul's addressing Timothy.

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.090
That's why he's written it writing this
letter to Timothy, and he's saying, Hey,

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.799
there's false teachers in your church.

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:48.870
They're teaching not the truth, right?

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.640
Teaching that the gospel is not right,
that we need to work for our salvation.

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.120
That there's some other things that you
should do and follow in order to come to

00:04:57.299 --> 00:04:59.340
Christ or income to, to be right with God.

00:05:00.015 --> 00:05:01.515
And Paul say, no, that's not.

00:05:01.515 --> 00:05:01.935
Right.

00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:02.205
Right.

00:05:02.205 --> 00:05:04.304
It's only the gospel,
the grace, the truth.

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:08.054
So he's writing to Timothy to say,
Hey, address these teachers with

00:05:08.054 --> 00:05:09.825
love and truth, love and truth.

00:05:10.094 --> 00:05:12.284
And then he says, Hey, there's a
couple of men and there's some,

00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:13.484
some women in your churches.

00:05:13.484 --> 00:05:15.645
Well, they're distracting the church.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.580
From the mission.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.359
And so he said, address them and
deal with them that he says to set

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:24.840
up some leaders in the church to
make sure that this is happening

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.609
to make sure that they are modeling
what it is to be a follower of Jesus.

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:33.120
And then today we get to this
text where Paul says this, this

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.260
critical statement in this text.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.140
And so we're getting ready to get into
it where he says, Hey, I need to write

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.340
to you because I can't come see you.

00:05:42.135 --> 00:05:43.065
With this important message.

00:05:43.065 --> 00:05:43.905
So let's jump into it.

00:05:43.905 --> 00:05:47.265
So we're all on the same page as
again, this is first Timothy chapter

00:05:47.265 --> 00:05:50.924
three, starting in verse 14, it says,
and this is Paul speaking to Timothy.

00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:54.164
He says, I write these things to
you, hoping to come to you soon.

00:05:55.185 --> 00:06:00.045
But if I should be delayed, I have written
so that you will know how the people ought

00:06:00.045 --> 00:06:04.275
to conduct themselves in God's household,
which is the church of the living God,

00:06:04.275 --> 00:06:06.105
the pillar of the foundation of truth.

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:09.675
And most certainly the
mystery of godliness is great.

00:06:10.065 --> 00:06:14.295
He was manifested in the flesh,
vindicated in the spirit, seen by angels,

00:06:14.475 --> 00:06:19.425
preached among the nations and believed
on in the world and taken up into.

00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:21.225
So let's pray.

00:06:21.405 --> 00:06:24.855
And if I got in, so Lord Jesus,
we are so thankful again for you.

00:06:24.855 --> 00:06:28.515
And we pray Lord that you take this
word and Lord you, you poured into our

00:06:28.515 --> 00:06:29.955
hearts and help us leave out of here.

00:06:30.195 --> 00:06:32.145
Lord changed by this message.

00:06:32.865 --> 00:06:34.155
So we pray this in your Hemly name.

00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:34.995
Amen.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.400
So Paul shares in this first couple
of verses here, how we should conduct

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.570
ourselves in the church and he mentions
this word, the household of God.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.710
And he says the family of God.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.160
But before we get there, I think I want to
kind of come back and mention this again.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.450
Paul is writing this message because
he cannot come to Timothy in person.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.750
So I started thinking through the
same statement we talked about

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.730
with Paul Revere, the apostle Paul.

00:07:00.525 --> 00:07:01.665
Had a great message.

00:07:01.665 --> 00:07:05.745
He says, Hey, it's important on how
we live our lives out for Jesus.

00:07:07.305 --> 00:07:10.005
And rather than waiting until I get
out of prison, because he was in prison

00:07:10.005 --> 00:07:12.495
and some belief he may have gotten down
and gone and seen them, uh, he may just

00:07:12.495 --> 00:07:15.075
been in there and this may have been
the last time that they'd ever saw,

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:17.565
um, daylight was, was in the prison.

00:07:18.435 --> 00:07:22.275
But he did not want to wait because
this message was so important.

00:07:22.784 --> 00:07:25.844
And when I started thinking about, if
he had delayed in sending this letter

00:07:25.844 --> 00:07:27.224
to Timothy, what would have happened?

00:07:27.555 --> 00:07:29.385
The church may have been
destroyed in emphasis.

00:07:29.534 --> 00:07:31.125
The church may have fallen apart.

00:07:31.335 --> 00:07:34.395
They may have began to be so
overwhelmed by the false teachers

00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:37.335
that they now were living contrary
to the truth of the gospel.

00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:40.094
So it was critical that Paul wrote this.

00:07:41.145 --> 00:07:45.735
And I started thinking, man, the message
that we have of Jesus today, we are

00:07:45.735 --> 00:07:47.535
celebrating the resurrection of Jesus.

00:07:47.715 --> 00:07:51.225
This message of hope is critical.

00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:54.855
It's timing of being received, right?

00:07:54.855 --> 00:07:55.665
We've received it.

00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:57.945
If you're here today at, by the
end of the day, you've received

00:07:57.945 --> 00:07:59.205
the message of the gospel.

00:07:59.475 --> 00:08:02.745
It is critical to take
that message and go and go.

00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:05.865
Because there's no guarantee
that tomorrow's promise.

00:08:06.015 --> 00:08:10.065
There's also no guarantee that if
we wait another couple of days, the,

00:08:10.065 --> 00:08:12.885
by the time it gets to this person
that they have not been let away.

00:08:13.545 --> 00:08:18.465
So this message from Paul is so
critical to speak to us today, right?

00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:21.975
Not only to the people that he was
speaking to in Timothy's letter

00:08:21.975 --> 00:08:25.335
about, Hey, how you should conduct
yourselves, but to us as a church,

00:08:25.335 --> 00:08:29.955
how we should conduct or getting
the word live our lives out in the.

00:08:31.215 --> 00:08:35.414
So, again, Paul's talking about this and
I'm kind of moving on here is that Paul's

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:36.975
message throughout this first book was.

00:08:37.965 --> 00:08:43.395
Really summed up in verse 15 is that he
is writing to help us as the family of

00:08:43.395 --> 00:08:46.035
God know how we should live our lives.

00:08:46.365 --> 00:08:49.305
So then the question is how
should we live our lives?

00:08:49.454 --> 00:08:52.694
Well, again, Paul has already talked
to us in the first three chapters

00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:56.475
about as a church, we should live our
lives to protect the truth, right?

00:08:56.505 --> 00:09:00.375
To address false teaching, to,
to not distract people from.

00:09:00.864 --> 00:09:04.224
Uh, Christ he's addressing the
men and the women in the church

00:09:04.224 --> 00:09:05.305
who were causing distractions.

00:09:05.484 --> 00:09:07.165
And he was talking about
setting up leaders.

00:09:07.375 --> 00:09:09.175
There's more of it that we're going
to learn the next couple weeks.

00:09:09.175 --> 00:09:12.265
So my encouragement is come back
because we're going to learn more about

00:09:12.265 --> 00:09:14.035
how the church should conduct itself.

00:09:14.484 --> 00:09:17.665
But again, he's talking about how we
should conduct ourselves in order to

00:09:17.665 --> 00:09:21.594
make sure that we are keeping Christ at
the center, that we are not distracting

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:25.885
from the message of the gospel, but
he uses this word God's household.

00:09:26.484 --> 00:09:30.265
When I think about God's household, it's
really translated the family of God.

00:09:31.795 --> 00:09:33.375
I know this is kind of personal question.

00:09:33.555 --> 00:09:36.225
How many all like your
family, like your family?

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:37.545
Okay.

00:09:37.694 --> 00:09:41.775
So half of us, so, so I know this could,
the other half, your family is not here,

00:09:41.775 --> 00:09:42.855
so you don't have to raise your hand.

00:09:44.085 --> 00:09:44.685
Don't worry.

00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:46.845
We, we took a picture and
we sent it to your family.

00:09:46.845 --> 00:09:48.345
So now they know if you truly love them.

00:09:49.635 --> 00:09:51.705
Truth, be told majority of
people love their family.

00:09:51.705 --> 00:09:52.515
Yeah, I know.

00:09:52.545 --> 00:09:54.105
And I want to, I want
to speak to this group.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.360
There's some of you guys
that grew up in a tough home.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.390
And so I know you may have some
bad feelings and some negative

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.980
families towards what family is.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.910
And my hope is is that now maybe the
families you currently have, maybe

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.640
if you're raising kids now, maybe
this is the family image you have

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.050
to have, but you love your family.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.550
Family's important.

00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:15.060
So Paul's saying how you should
conduct yourself or how you

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.130
should live as the family of God.

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:21.120
When I think of family, I tend to
give a lot more grace and mercy.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:22.170
I love my family.

00:10:22.199 --> 00:10:23.069
I'll take a bullet for my.

00:10:24.465 --> 00:10:28.515
I started thinking about how Paul's
addressing the church as a family

00:10:28.515 --> 00:10:32.865
of God and how critical that is
for each one of us to think of

00:10:32.865 --> 00:10:35.325
the church as a family of God.

00:10:35.895 --> 00:10:40.875
Now, when I think about my family, I
think again, about as my, as a, again,

00:10:42.089 --> 00:10:44.099
To my sister and my brother, right.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.180
I love them to death.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.420
And I've had some fights with them
and some struggles with them, but

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.650
also have really worked hard to
reconcile those relationships.

00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:55.020
I've had some struggles with my kids.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:59.099
We all know raising kids is difficult,
especially 13 year old daughter.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.870
Um, love her to death, but it's
difficult at times, but with the

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.810
family of God, it's the same way.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.370
We're all different people.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.849
But all changed by one person, Jesus.

00:11:13.449 --> 00:11:14.920
And because we're changed by one person.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.099
And again, once we've given our lives
to Christ, once we've been changed by

00:11:18.099 --> 00:11:23.860
Jesus, we now become a family that works
together to show others who Jesus is.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.180
And so how we treat one another is so
important, how we care for one another

00:11:28.329 --> 00:11:31.540
and provide for one another's needs
is so important, despite a different.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.810
Because we all look different.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:34.980
We all act different.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:35.880
We're not perfect.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.140
We're imperfect people coming together
to say, Hey, we want to be better

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.610
because God has changed your life.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.300
And here's how we can be better
by building one up one another

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.600
up by forgiving one another
by giving towards one another.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.390
And by, by also just encouraging,
I'm telling you a word of

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.740
encouragement will change.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:53.130
Someone's.

00:11:54.285 --> 00:11:59.055
So by Paul speaking directly to this
term of family, it's so important

00:11:59.265 --> 00:12:03.345
that we, as the family of God,
conduct ourselves in a manner worthy

00:12:03.345 --> 00:12:07.185
of a family, that's that views those
things that I just mentioned together.

00:12:08.085 --> 00:12:09.285
And so I usually mentioned this thing.

00:12:09.285 --> 00:12:12.314
This is one thing to learn about
inspiring hope is we usually say

00:12:12.314 --> 00:12:15.525
after you've attended a couple of
times, we start calling you family.

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:19.395
Now that may be weird to you, and
I'm sorry if it is, but it's just

00:12:19.395 --> 00:12:22.515
true because we start viewing you as
somebody that's so important to us.

00:12:22.725 --> 00:12:27.585
Somebody that we truly care for, that
we want to walk alongside you to do

00:12:27.585 --> 00:12:32.535
life together, to help you know, how to
follow Jesus and know your creator more.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.720
And that's why I think God's calling
us to do what Paul's challenging.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.850
The church do is be a family.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.700
Do what it is that
families do for each other.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.360
Right.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.540
Stick up for one another, be
present and be encouraging.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.100
And I know this, that, that as a church
that does that will, I'm telling you

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.280
this, a church that takes care of
each other and loves each other and

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.580
build each other up like crisis called
a stew will be the light of Christ.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.090
The world.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.010
There will be people
that will ask questions.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.400
Why do you keep going to that church?

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.490
And you could just be like, because their
family, what do you mean their family?

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:06.150
Man.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.760
Let me tell you about a time when
I was going through a rough patch.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.510
Let me tell you about a time
when I was just struggling.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.130
What I wasn't perfect.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.810
When I sinned, when I fell short, they
picked me up, they gave me a hug and

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:24.240
they said, Th they, they show me God's
word and they said, God's word is truth.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.970
And, and God gives us joy
and hope and forgiveness.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.360
And he says that he loves us, even
in our deepest, darkest moments.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.600
Now that's the church that
I want to be a part of.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:33.840
Right.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.160
And then they're like, oh my gosh.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.870
Like, I don't know churches
that are like that.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.910
Well, why, why is Paul
writing this letter?

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.090
Because he's addressing a church
that probably wasn't being.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:48.810
So it's a challenge today that we should
conduct or live our lives in such a way

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.190
that we are a family that we are taking
care of one another so that we can be

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.230
the light of Christ to those around us.

00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:59.445
So how important is it for the family
of God to conduct themselves worthy?

00:13:59.745 --> 00:14:04.365
Uh, as a worthy manner, basically
it's important because we are every

00:14:04.365 --> 00:14:07.245
day, whether we know it or not
reflecting Christ, if you have a

00:14:07.245 --> 00:14:09.885
relationship with Jesus, getting,
maybe you're not in this room and

00:14:09.885 --> 00:14:11.025
you haven't given your life to Jesus.

00:14:11.025 --> 00:14:14.025
And if you haven't, I hope
you do before today is up.

00:14:14.415 --> 00:14:18.195
But if you've given your life to Jesus
every day, you are writing a story.

00:14:18.195 --> 00:14:21.255
You're telling a story with your
life, your actions and your words.

00:14:21.405 --> 00:14:23.085
Now, let me just again, say this.

00:14:23.205 --> 00:14:24.315
Will you be perfect?

00:14:24.345 --> 00:14:24.435
No.

00:14:26.415 --> 00:14:30.465
Outside of, you know,
Jesus, we can't be perfect.

00:14:30.465 --> 00:14:34.395
And so it's understanding we are
a work in progress, but as we

00:14:34.395 --> 00:14:40.755
consistently grow together, we are
going to be a light to those around us.

00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:45.915
So it is so important that we are a
family that we show others what family is.

00:14:45.915 --> 00:14:47.655
And that's where Paul's getting at here.

00:14:47.835 --> 00:14:48.135
Right.

00:14:48.135 --> 00:14:48.705
Showing.

00:14:49.604 --> 00:14:50.505
Love for one another.

00:14:50.775 --> 00:14:52.844
So he says how we should conduct
ourselves with the family.

00:14:52.844 --> 00:14:55.665
God, that's the kind of in that verse
15, and we're gonna kind of be in

00:14:55.665 --> 00:14:56.895
verse 15 for the most of the time.

00:14:57.074 --> 00:14:58.364
And he talks about this
second part, right?

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:02.744
So how we ought to conduct ourselves
in God's household, which is the family

00:15:02.744 --> 00:15:07.155
of God, which is the church of the
living God, the church of the living.

00:15:07.155 --> 00:15:07.454
God.

00:15:08.055 --> 00:15:10.785
So he's talking now directly, how
we should conduct ourselves as

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:14.895
the church or another word for
the church is the called out one.

00:15:15.885 --> 00:15:16.185
Right.

00:15:16.185 --> 00:15:17.985
The family of God is the
church of the living.

00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:18.135
God.

00:15:18.135 --> 00:15:18.765
And start thinking about that.

00:15:18.765 --> 00:15:19.995
This is what we're talking about today.

00:15:20.205 --> 00:15:24.165
The living God, today we are
celebrating Jesus who is not dead.

00:15:24.165 --> 00:15:25.065
I'm so thankful.

00:15:25.065 --> 00:15:25.665
I'll just tell you this.

00:15:25.905 --> 00:15:29.955
I'm so thankful that I do not
follow and worship a dead God.

00:15:30.285 --> 00:15:30.915
We're no why?

00:15:31.545 --> 00:15:32.325
Cause the get dead.

00:15:32.325 --> 00:15:34.185
God has not helped me in my time of need.

00:15:34.665 --> 00:15:36.165
He's worthless a dead.

00:15:36.165 --> 00:15:39.915
God can not forgive me of my sins
because he has not defeated death

00:15:40.245 --> 00:15:41.595
because you just being honest.

00:15:42.405 --> 00:15:47.954
My sins be falling short of being able
to be perfect is sending me to death.

00:15:47.985 --> 00:15:53.204
I will one day die physically
and spiritually apart from being

00:15:53.204 --> 00:15:57.255
forgiven of my sins and Jesus who
is a living, God who rose from

00:15:57.255 --> 00:16:00.344
the dead has conquered that death.

00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:02.505
And because he's conquered death,
he's the only one that I know

00:16:02.505 --> 00:16:03.555
that's ever conquered death.

00:16:03.615 --> 00:16:05.415
And now he currently lives in.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:11.340
And he currently has a relationship with
me because I've chosen to accept his

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:16.650
payment on the cross and his forgiveness
of my sins so that I can experience life

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.200
now and I can experience life in heaven.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.480
And I love that picture because I get
to have a relationship with a living

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.000
God that does so many things for me.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:27.960
So many things.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.430
And if it wasn't for Jesus dying
on the cross, then we would

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.810
not be able to defeat death.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.130
Jesus's resurrection proved that
death was defeated because of our sin.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.310
Again, we will die one day and I
started thinking about this when we

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:42.960
die one a day, apart from Christ.

00:16:44.579 --> 00:16:45.300
W where are we going to go?

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.490
A lot of times, so many pastors
will talk about where are we going?

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.360
We're going to hell.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.510
What, what, why, why would you talk
about hell on resurrection Sunday?

00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:52.770
I started thinking about this.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:53.969
Why should I even talk about that?

00:16:53.969 --> 00:16:57.209
Because here's the, here's the
thing Jesus talked about hell twice

00:16:57.209 --> 00:17:00.240
as many times, as he talked about
heaven, you wanna know why now?

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.860
Because he wanted anybody to go there.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.780
It was a warning sign.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:05.710
I'll tell you guys this.

00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:08.520
If you're going to drive off a
cliff there, you're going to put as

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.780
many warning signs up as possible.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.020
But typically if you're driving
into Florida, there's one side

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.130
welcome to Florida, right?

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:14.790
It's great.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.290
Now I'm not saying Florida is heaven.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.060
It may be close.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.740
I like the beaches, but warning
signs, because we don't want

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:23.760
people falling off the cliff.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.240
Jesus talked about hell, because
he does not want us to spend

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.890
any eternity separated from him.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.520
He desires for you to know him.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.930
Your creator, why you were alive
is because of God creating you.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.420
And you may say, well, my
parents actually created me with.

00:17:40.635 --> 00:17:43.695
They had the ability to do that
because God created humans.

00:17:43.875 --> 00:17:48.165
And so when you build that big picture,
your creator loves you so much that he

00:17:48.165 --> 00:17:52.455
wants you to know him personally now,
and experience a relationship with

00:17:52.455 --> 00:17:55.485
him now and in eternity, in heaven.

00:17:56.324 --> 00:17:59.355
So it's so important when we
think about this, he's talking

00:17:59.355 --> 00:18:01.365
about the living God, right?

00:18:01.485 --> 00:18:03.044
But then he uses this word, the.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.520
The church is again, defined as if you
go and look at the definition of church.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:15.390
It's the called out once it's not the
come in ones, they called out once.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.620
So here's what we do.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:21.000
We come in to celebrate, to learn
and to grow and to encourage

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.740
and be the family together.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:27.690
And the we're called to go out
with the message and the hope

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.910
of Jesus to those around us.

00:18:30.689 --> 00:18:34.889
Who had never experienced that who
have been hurt by other churches who

00:18:34.889 --> 00:18:37.590
have never experienced a family of God.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:44.550
We have been called out to go
present the living God, not the

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:50.429
dead God, but the living God, we
again, have to make that a priority.

00:18:51.389 --> 00:18:55.139
When we think about Easter, Easter is a
Sunday that a lot of people will attend.

00:18:56.205 --> 00:18:59.085
And if this is the first time you've
attended services in a while, welcome

00:18:59.085 --> 00:19:04.365
back, Easter is a great time to attend
service, but I believe Easter is

00:19:04.365 --> 00:19:08.085
something that we can celebrate every
day, which is the resurrection of Jesus.

00:19:08.355 --> 00:19:09.375
I don't want to make this statement.

00:19:09.375 --> 00:19:11.595
I want to be as encouraged as
I can, but it's something I

00:19:11.595 --> 00:19:12.705
was challenged with this week.

00:19:12.975 --> 00:19:16.514
Um, I actually get an opportunity
to, uh, coach at a CrossFit

00:19:16.514 --> 00:19:17.685
gym a couple of times a week.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.220
I was talking to a couple of people
that were working out and I said,

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.170
yeah, I got a pretty easy weekend.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.210
It's it's a pretty chill weekend
in there, like looking at me.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:26.770
And they're like, aren't you a pastor?

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:28.390
And I'm like, yeah.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.270
They're like, isn't this
like your Superbowl weekend?

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.000
And I'm like, oh yeah, Easter.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.300
I mean, I wasn't like dumbing down
Easter, but I'm like, yeah, Sunday.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.710
I mean, it's a big day for us.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:43.090
And I started thinking about, should
Easter be our super bowl Sunday?

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.550
And here was my thought.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.870
The day that Jesus rose
was Superbowl Sunday.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:55.690
The cool part is that ever since then,
every day after has been super bowl,

00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:00.790
Sunday is been, the big game is been
the biggest moment of everybody's life

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.990
has the opportunity to be changed,
to win the most important thing,

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:08.350
which is the salvation of your life,
forgiveness of your sins and a new

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.270
life today, and a new life in eternity.

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:12.540
Is that not true?

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.590
Maybe I'm wrong.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.790
Maybe you don't like football.

00:20:15.209 --> 00:20:17.340
I'm not going to bring
in a baseball analogy.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.830
I'm sorry, but that's all
I got is a football one.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:20.370
Right.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:24.360
But every day should be our
super bowl Sunday because of

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.370
what Jesus has done on the cross.

00:20:26.639 --> 00:20:28.590
We worship.

00:20:29.565 --> 00:20:35.025
Uh, living God, we are the called
out ones to go shine the light of

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:38.805
Christ now, because we have to do
not walk out of here going man.

00:20:38.815 --> 00:20:41.865
Another pastor just put another
burden on me to go live like Christ.

00:20:41.865 --> 00:20:43.425
And I'm not perfect, guys.

00:20:43.425 --> 00:20:44.745
Please understand this.

00:20:45.015 --> 00:20:48.465
You will never live the life that
God's called you to live on your

00:20:48.465 --> 00:20:50.565
own with that mentality either.

00:20:50.595 --> 00:20:54.015
God's never said, take
this burden upon you.

00:20:54.255 --> 00:20:56.775
He says no cast all your cares on me on.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.290
Take care of them.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.780
He says, go and live in freedom of
that burden because God is so changed

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.940
you that he will work through you.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.080
No matter your personality, your
background, to be able to be the

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.430
light of Christ to those around you.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:16.470
See that's the challenge is that because
God has so changed our life, that

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:21.180
we are called out to share that with
others, the message of the resurrection.

00:21:22.004 --> 00:21:23.175
Is so important.

00:21:23.655 --> 00:21:27.284
The other people need to
hear it and to see it.

00:21:27.915 --> 00:21:29.324
And that's why Paul is challenging.

00:21:29.324 --> 00:21:29.865
Timothy.

00:21:30.014 --> 00:21:34.965
Your conduct in the church is so
important that you show your, the

00:21:34.965 --> 00:21:38.115
family of God that you show you are
the called out ones of a living.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.770
But he doesn't stop there.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:46.680
Then he says this, he says, we should also
conduct ourselves as the pillars of truth.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.659
Now let's look at this and I'm
gonna kind of pull this back around.

00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:51.120
Cause you may be saying, but
isn't Jesus, the pillar truth.

00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.510
Amen.

00:21:52.215 --> 00:21:52.965
He absolutely is.

00:21:52.965 --> 00:21:56.564
So let's look at this together and
get out to kind of read 15 together.

00:21:56.564 --> 00:22:00.044
He says, but if I should to be delayed, I
have written to you so that you will know

00:22:00.344 --> 00:22:04.395
how people ought to conduct themselves
in God's household, the family of God.

00:22:04.725 --> 00:22:04.995
Right.

00:22:05.264 --> 00:22:08.594
Which is the church of the living
God, the, the called out ones

00:22:08.594 --> 00:22:13.304
of the living God, the pillar
and the foundation of the truth.

00:22:13.905 --> 00:22:14.834
Jesus.

00:22:14.865 --> 00:22:18.824
Yes, he is the pillar and
the foundation of the truth.

00:22:19.635 --> 00:22:21.074
We are facing daily.

00:22:22.035 --> 00:22:26.175
With people that are constantly trying
to pull us away and draw us away from

00:22:26.175 --> 00:22:31.065
what the truth is that does anybody
ever get distracted by false statements?

00:22:31.065 --> 00:22:34.365
And I'm not talking about the Facebook
labels that say this, this may be

00:22:34.365 --> 00:22:36.615
false, although that could be you too.

00:22:37.245 --> 00:22:40.485
Cause that's probably false as well,
but I don't care what news outlet you

00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:43.305
listened to, what newspaper you listen
to, what radio you listen to, what

00:22:43.305 --> 00:22:44.685
person you talked to down the road.

00:22:44.835 --> 00:22:47.445
Every one of them is, is
going to tell you their truth.

00:22:48.015 --> 00:22:49.515
And the question is what is true?

00:22:50.355 --> 00:22:51.405
What is truth.

00:22:51.885 --> 00:22:56.294
And today I want to challenge you
with this, that Jesus is truth.

00:22:57.195 --> 00:22:59.445
He is the pillar of truth.

00:22:59.955 --> 00:23:02.375
And I'm going to get to a little bit
more of how you going to understand

00:23:02.385 --> 00:23:03.495
it, but, but think about this.

00:23:03.495 --> 00:23:06.074
If Jesus is truth, his word is truth.

00:23:06.975 --> 00:23:09.855
Then we can not get
distracted by anything else.

00:23:09.855 --> 00:23:12.405
That's false because anytime we hear
something else, we can come back

00:23:12.405 --> 00:23:13.725
to the word and say, is this truth?

00:23:14.655 --> 00:23:17.804
And if it's not, we reject it
because God's word is true.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.610
Again, because the
world is distracting us.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.070
Truth is something that we grasp onto.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:27.300
It's something that we have been, we've
been experienced or we've been changed by.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.660
And this is what I always tell people
this I'm not a pastor because Hey,

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.790
I was just looking for a job to do.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.040
And, you know, I just really want
to figure out how to make a lot of

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.920
money in the ministry because you
know, that's what pastors do now.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.740
I literally am standing here today
because I've been changed by the.

00:23:41.985 --> 00:23:46.125
I'll tell you this catch somebody
who has been changed by something and

00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:47.775
those whereby the rest of the license.

00:23:47.775 --> 00:23:50.685
I shouldn't say swear in the
church, but they'll live by it.

00:23:51.225 --> 00:23:52.275
If they've been changed by it.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:58.570
I'm standing here today because I've
been changed by the truth of Jesus been

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:03.820
forgiven because I was broken, been
helped when I was in need, seeing God

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:08.110
show up and miraculous ways over and
over again, because that's who God is.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.120
I've been so changed by God.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.380
I stand here today.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:15.040
Somebody that lived in Oklahoma two
and a half years ago, I, it here today

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.110
because God said, go share the truth here.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.110
And all of us, all of us.

00:24:21.679 --> 00:24:27.889
Can experience the truth of Jesus, the
pillar of truth, which is this, this truth

00:24:27.889 --> 00:24:29.960
that is raised up above everything else.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:33.620
And it can take away all the things
that again, are false in your life.

00:24:33.649 --> 00:24:36.800
All the things that are trying to distract
you, all the things that are trying to

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:42.830
sway you away from who God is, what he's
designed you for relationship with him.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.310
And again, that relationship
is not a burden.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.429
It's a.

00:24:47.754 --> 00:24:51.504
So this pillar of truth is so important
as we cleaned to this pillar, though,

00:24:51.504 --> 00:24:55.554
this is the challenge I want you to
see in this, as we cleaned this truth,

00:24:56.784 --> 00:24:59.725
we now begin to live out that truth.

00:24:59.875 --> 00:25:01.225
We become pillars of truth.

00:25:01.245 --> 00:25:01.945
I want you to see this.

00:25:02.155 --> 00:25:05.004
If you clean to the truth of Jesus,
who is the pillar of truth and

00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:09.024
you receive it and you live it,
you have now become the pillar of.

00:25:10.215 --> 00:25:10.845
The pillar of Chanel.

00:25:11.045 --> 00:25:13.215
Now you may be saying, cause
I define a lot of things.

00:25:13.215 --> 00:25:14.415
What is the word pillar?

00:25:14.505 --> 00:25:15.465
What is a pillar?

00:25:15.585 --> 00:25:19.845
A pillar is a statue put on a
pedestal so everyone can see it.

00:25:20.115 --> 00:25:25.635
Or it's a statue that holds the truth
up to be displayed tall and high.

00:25:26.115 --> 00:25:27.105
So think about this.

00:25:28.565 --> 00:25:33.935
Each day when you leave out of your
home or you wake up and you take care

00:25:33.935 --> 00:25:38.375
of your kids or you go to work or
you're at the grocery store or for

00:25:38.375 --> 00:25:40.655
some of you that log on to go to work.

00:25:41.285 --> 00:25:41.435
Okay.

00:25:41.465 --> 00:25:48.575
I don't know where you are in it,
but you are a statue on a pillar.

00:25:49.335 --> 00:25:53.685
Portraying truth to the whole world
of who Jesus is, that Jesus is alive,

00:25:53.835 --> 00:25:57.585
that he loves you, that he can forgive
you, that he can walk alongside you.

00:25:57.765 --> 00:26:03.765
The, he brings hope, joy, patience,
peace, everything that God gives

00:26:04.065 --> 00:26:05.655
is in his word, which is truth.

00:26:05.865 --> 00:26:08.685
And if you'll get in there and you'll
start receiving it and you'll start

00:26:08.685 --> 00:26:10.395
living it, you will be a pillar of truth.

00:26:11.175 --> 00:26:14.205
See how we conduct ourselves in the
church is so important because here's the.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.740
If we don't truly believe that we've been
changed by the gospel, by what Jesus has

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.080
done, we won't go be pillars of truth.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.460
Right?

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.360
Why would we, because we don't
fully believe it, but when we

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.650
believe it, we become that.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:33.420
So for some of us today, maybe I just need
to receive what the pillar of truth is.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.160
He received who Jesus is.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.770
That's how it become a light to the world.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.910
Is any received the message.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.649
So again, our conduct and our life
displays the truth of Jesus every

00:26:43.649 --> 00:26:45.149
day, whether we believe it or not.

00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:48.000
And I started thinking through this,
you may be the only, and you hear

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.969
these statements before you may
be the only Bible someone reads.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.510
You may be now listen to this.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.479
You may be the only
church someone attends.

00:26:58.139 --> 00:26:59.100
What are you talking about?

00:26:59.459 --> 00:27:02.010
Because if they, if they just
meet with me, is that church?

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.510
Well, church is the called out ones.

00:27:04.919 --> 00:27:05.429
You're the church.

00:27:05.459 --> 00:27:06.300
You're part of the church.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:06.780
Does that make sense?

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:10.560
You may be the only church
someone sees and experiences.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.730
Let me challenge you with the last
one, the presence, you may be the

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:19.260
only presence of Christ they ever
experience because God lives inside

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.410
of you and you go live it out.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.010
When you are standing, when you
are talking, when you were engaging

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.460
someone next to you, whether it's at
your home at your office or in the.

00:27:30.735 --> 00:27:32.024
If you don't go to Walmart, it's Kroger.

00:27:32.655 --> 00:27:35.835
If you're standing next to someone
and you have the presence of Christ

00:27:35.835 --> 00:27:41.655
in you, you are maybe the closest
they've ever been to who Jesus is.

00:27:42.525 --> 00:27:46.605
See that, that changes my mentality
with life, because it's not about me

00:27:46.605 --> 00:27:48.195
anymore because man I've been changed.

00:27:48.465 --> 00:27:51.255
It's about those who don't know
Jesus now, because I'm trying

00:27:51.255 --> 00:27:52.245
to push an agenda on them.

00:27:52.245 --> 00:27:54.045
I've just been changed, man.

00:27:54.045 --> 00:27:56.925
And F I've been changed, uh,
really want somebody else to

00:27:56.925 --> 00:27:58.155
experience that same change.

00:27:58.485 --> 00:27:59.805
And so it just flows out of me.

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:02.745
And I remember this statement
by kid who was talking to his

00:28:02.745 --> 00:28:04.875
dad and his dad's telling him
that Jesus lives inside of him.

00:28:04.875 --> 00:28:06.165
And he's like, well,
dad, I just don't get it.

00:28:06.165 --> 00:28:07.785
And he said, son, what do you mean?

00:28:08.055 --> 00:28:10.935
He said, dad, if Jesus lived
inside me, wouldn't he stick?

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.700
That's logical, right?

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:21.450
He's a little kid and Jesus is God
absolutely send your ripe every day when

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:25.020
we're pillars of truth, Jesus sticks out.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.040
Amen.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:31.810
That's why Paul saying your conduct in
the church, your, the way you live your

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:36.430
life in the church, the called out ones
is so important to be pillars of truth.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:36.910
Why?

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:38.740
Because Jesus is alive.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:39.610
Jesus.

00:28:40.545 --> 00:28:41.265
It's alive.

00:28:41.415 --> 00:28:46.125
And he is alive every day, wanting
to know each one of us personally, to

00:28:46.125 --> 00:28:50.895
wanting to walk alongside us every day
for us to know him every single day.

00:28:51.075 --> 00:28:53.235
That's the God that we serve.

00:28:53.685 --> 00:28:57.285
See Philippians two 14 through
16, says this, do everything

00:28:57.285 --> 00:28:59.085
without grumbling or arguing.

00:28:59.295 --> 00:29:03.525
Man, I need to hear this every day so
that you may be blameless and pure.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:08.580
Children of God who are faultless in a
crooked and perverted generation among

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:13.440
whom you shine, like stars in the world
by holding firm to the word of life.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:19.020
We are stars shining the
truth of Jesus every day.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.750
So how does our conduct, right?

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.570
How does that affect the
message of the gospel?

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.860
So think about this.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.670
How our conduct, how we conduct
ourselves as the family of God,

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.940
the called out ones, the pillars
of truth will affect how others

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.190
understand the mystery of the gospel.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:39.360
Let's verse 16, verse 16 says
this and the most certainly the

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.280
mystery of godliness is great.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.879
That we're great is like great
and understanding like the

00:29:44.879 --> 00:29:46.889
mystery of it is, is, is large.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.300
It's hard to fully grasp.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:49.440
Right.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.050
And he goes on and he says, and he
was manifested in the flesh and he was

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.800
vindicated in the spirit, seen by angels
preached among the nations bleed on,

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.600
in the world and taken up into glory.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.950
And this is, speaking of Jesus, see the
mystery of the gospel again is great.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:05.040
And, and here's the other thing, the
mystery of why followers of Jesus

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.730
live the way they do is great because
I've been challenged so many times.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.680
Ben, why do you live the way you live?

00:30:11.685 --> 00:30:14.955
And I always say, man, because I've
been changed now because I have to, but

00:30:14.955 --> 00:30:18.915
because of been changed, so that mystery
is great, but because the mystery is

00:30:18.915 --> 00:30:26.265
great, the world around us needs us to
explain and to live a life that explains

00:30:26.265 --> 00:30:30.465
that mystery to them, non perfection,
but actually in true honesty because

00:30:30.465 --> 00:30:33.975
when you come before others and you're
broken, you don't have it all together.

00:30:34.125 --> 00:30:35.985
You get to say, Hey, welcome to church.

00:30:36.855 --> 00:30:38.265
Cause we don't have it all together.

00:30:38.265 --> 00:30:38.475
If.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.189
Did you wouldn't want to be around us?

00:30:41.189 --> 00:30:42.389
Cause we'd find a way to screw it up.

00:30:42.419 --> 00:30:43.439
We don't have it all together.

00:30:43.439 --> 00:30:45.659
So I hope that we can just
relate with one another.

00:30:45.659 --> 00:30:46.050
Right?

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.689
So you can be the church
to those around us.

00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:52.290
So we have to challenge ourselves
just as Paul challenging us to

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:54.030
be the light of those around us.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:54.419
Right.

00:30:55.409 --> 00:30:58.830
And it's so important when we think
about this, that the, the, our conduct

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:03.419
is so important because Jesus came
into the world to save sinners, right?

00:31:03.479 --> 00:31:04.320
Who are sinners?

00:31:04.379 --> 00:31:05.340
All of us there.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.889
Ain't one of us in here that
can say, Hey, I'm perfect.

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.399
Right?

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:12.570
So Jesus came for every single one
of us so that we can experience.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.300
What God has forced
forgiveness of our sins.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.440
And I always tell people this, if
you're sitting here thinking what,

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.160
there's some law I'm telling you,
I want to give you this example.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:25.290
I spent a year in the church listening to
the gospel and try to make myself right.

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:27.480
Trying to get everything right in my life.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.580
And here's what I was
always challenged with men.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.950
You know, I just, well, there's
certain things I want to do.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:34.050
I don't want to give up this and
I don't want to say no to that.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.890
And by the end of it, it finally
got to this idea that everything

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:39.720
that God offered to me was.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:44.010
See, sin is not God's best for you.

00:31:44.879 --> 00:31:46.710
God's got something better for you.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:51.540
If we would stop looking at living for
Jesus as giving up all the things I like

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:56.040
to do and start thinking of, of, of living
for Jesus is experiencing God's best,

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.450
which is better than what I had before.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:58.409
Does that make sense?

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.720
We would change the way we follow Jesus.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.510
We would change the way
maybe even coming to Jesus.

00:32:05.175 --> 00:32:08.084
Can I be a testimony today
I've experienced that.

00:32:08.294 --> 00:32:12.854
And I've seen what I had before is nothing
compared to what I have now through Jesus.

00:32:14.564 --> 00:32:16.814
See, those are the things
we share with the world.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:20.980
So God has called us again,
to challenge ourselves, to, to

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.960
conduct yourselves in a way.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.300
And so this verse reminds us
of this, and this is where the

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.399
story of Jesus comes in, right?

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.379
He was manifested in the flesh.

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:29.280
What does that mean?

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.530
That Jesus was manifested in the flesh.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:36.300
It was basically this, that
God was made known to the world

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.310
through Jesus in the flesh.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:41.850
God came down from heaven
and he decided to come.

00:32:43.169 --> 00:32:43.889
Jesus.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.429
And he says, I'm going to walk and
live and have flesh just like you.

00:32:47.429 --> 00:32:49.770
And I'm going to have to sleep
and I'm going to have to eat.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.000
And I'm going to have mood swings.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.439
Maybe Jesus did a mood swings disease.

00:32:52.439 --> 00:32:52.919
Perfect.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.949
So he probably ate plenty of
food because I know I don't,

00:32:56.399 --> 00:32:59.669
but Jesus was God in the flesh.

00:32:59.879 --> 00:33:02.040
Here's what I'll tell you this, the God I.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.890
I didn't just say, Hey, figure it out.

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:08.760
He says, Hey, let me go walk alongside
you and live the life that you have

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.060
to live and show you how to live it
and how, yes, it's difficult, but

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.380
I'll be with you everywhere you go.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.500
See, that's what I love when he talks
about he was manifested in the flesh.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:18.360
God didn't stay in heaven
and he came to earth.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.820
Then he talks about, he was
vindicated in the spirit.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:21.690
That word is great.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:26.280
He was vindicated what it was
that Jesus was made, right.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:26.700
When.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.550
I thought he was wrong.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:28.790
Right?

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:29.510
This is what this means.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.130
Jesus was proved to be correct.

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:32.300
After people said he was wrong.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:33.740
See Jesus would walk around.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.810
And again, he wasn't much to say
this, but people would ask the

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.030
question, are you the son of God?

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:37.790
He said, yes.

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:39.680
And he would talk about that.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.040
He was here to save people from
their sins and to show forgiveness.

00:33:44.175 --> 00:33:47.834
And people didn't believe him, but when
he hung on the cross and he died and

00:33:47.834 --> 00:33:52.215
he was in the tomb for three days and
he rose back from the dead, he proved

00:33:52.215 --> 00:33:55.784
that he was there to conquer death,
that he was there to conquer our Senate.

00:33:55.814 --> 00:34:00.044
He was there to be with us
one day in glory and heaven.

00:34:01.245 --> 00:34:05.925
And so that right there was Jesus being
vindicated made ride by who he truly is.

00:34:06.104 --> 00:34:07.185
Can we be vindicated?

00:34:07.215 --> 00:34:07.965
Absolutely.

00:34:08.085 --> 00:34:10.574
When we give our lives to
Jesus, we're vindicated through

00:34:10.574 --> 00:34:11.534
a relationship with Jesus.

00:34:11.654 --> 00:34:13.005
We are made right.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.350
When others want to point at
us and say that you're broken.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:19.350
Absolutely I'm broken, but
I'm made right through Jesus.

00:34:19.709 --> 00:34:23.520
So everyday we now get to be vindicated
because Christ was vindicated.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.029
So then it says that
Jesus was seen by angels.

00:34:26.029 --> 00:34:29.100
Speaking of after his resurrection,
then he talks about the Jesus

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.270
was preached among the nations.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:32.459
Why was Jesus preached among the nations?

00:34:32.459 --> 00:34:36.209
Here's what I believe, because there
was people that were so changed by

00:34:36.209 --> 00:34:37.919
Jesus, that they took the message.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.220
And they begin to conduct themselves as
the church ought to conduct themselves

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:48.500
as the family of God, as the called
out ones, as a pillar of truth.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:52.550
See, he was preached because people had
been changed, not because they felt like

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.140
they were suppressed into preaching.

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:56.720
Jesus, I'll tell you nobody would
do that because at some point at

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.100
the end of it, you become a burden.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:01.340
No, they preached because
they were changed by Jesus.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.380
So they preached this message
and here's the cool part.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.230
Not only was he preached
among the nations.

00:35:07.215 --> 00:35:09.435
And I think about this, if he
wasn't preached among the nations,

00:35:09.435 --> 00:35:10.275
we wouldn't be in this church.

00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:14.505
You know that because we would've never
got the message and I want to be the

00:35:14.505 --> 00:35:19.154
church that preaches the truth among the
nations, so that some other church that

00:35:19.154 --> 00:35:22.694
begins to meet can look back and say,
because we were faithful in preaching the

00:35:22.694 --> 00:35:27.194
message they are there today, but not only
did he preach these, these people preach

00:35:27.194 --> 00:35:28.485
the message so that the world could.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:33.839
It says that they believe this is
Jesus was believed on by many in the

00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:37.649
world because of the faithful people
that shared the message, God used that

00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:41.730
message to transform people's lives
and they begin to believe, and that

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.930
kept going over and over again, until
we see today, we are a church that has

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:52.169
changed by Jesus who has manifested in
the flesh, indicated in the spirit, seen

00:35:52.169 --> 00:35:54.629
by angels preached among the nations.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.880
People believed.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.390
And then it says that he
was taken up into glory.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.310
Here's one of the beautiful parts
Jesus was taken up into heaven.

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.590
And you may say, why did
he leave us on earth?

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.590
Because if Jesus would have
stayed on earth, everybody

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.759
would have just followed Jesus.

00:36:08.759 --> 00:36:12.090
And at some point it would have gotten
too big of a crowd and everybody

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.170
wouldn't have got their time with Jesus.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:13.980
So this is what Jesus said.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.420
It is better for me to leave the new stay.

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.819
Why?

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:23.770
Because the holy spirit, which
is God in us, Is now Jesus saying

00:36:23.799 --> 00:36:28.180
I actually get to go further in
the world because I'm leaving.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.939
So he went back to be with his
father and he says, whenever I go,

00:36:30.939 --> 00:36:32.470
I will prepare a place for you.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:33.459
And I will come back.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.490
Here's the cool part.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.340
Jesus is not just leaving
us to figure it all out.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.830
Jesus left himself inside of us.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.660
When we give our lives to Christ, he
is inside of us and he walks with us.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:50.970
So the greatest story of Easter is
what Jesus has done for every one of us

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:55.230
to transform our lives, to change our
lives, to give us hope and forgiveness,

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.650
to give us grace and to give us mercy.

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:01.950
So we celebrate Easter because
we have a story and we have a

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:03.480
message of hope to share it with.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:05.939
Again, celebrating.

00:37:05.939 --> 00:37:09.209
It reminds us that we need to live a
life worthy of the message of the gospel.

00:37:09.359 --> 00:37:13.169
Not just one day, a
year on Easter, but 365.

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:14.359
And is it 66?

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.500
If there's a leap year,
I didn't state that one.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.459
Maybe you get that one off.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:17.850
Okay.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.970
But just so you know,
we need to receive it.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.879
We need to remember it and we need
to share it with those around us.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.419
We are, I want to challenge
you guys this as a church, we

00:37:27.419 --> 00:37:28.859
are the family of God on this.

00:37:30.435 --> 00:37:35.355
We are the called out ones, the
church and the world to be stars

00:37:35.505 --> 00:37:37.215
shining the light of Jesus.

00:37:38.055 --> 00:37:42.165
We are the pillars of truth, holding
at the truth of Jesus to be displayed

00:37:42.615 --> 00:37:45.945
so that many in the world can hear
that Jesus, the son of God has

00:37:45.945 --> 00:37:47.565
conquered our brokenness in our sin.

00:37:47.805 --> 00:37:50.085
He's conquered our death
and he is alive today.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.540
And we can be alive in God
today, ready and willing.

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.150
God is ready and willing to have a
personal relationship with each one of

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:01.590
us in this room, we have the choice to
receive that Jesus has changed my life.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:06.030
I've seen him change so many people's
lives in this church and in my life

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:09.810
that I will continue to preach this
message, every opportunity I get, but

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:15.120
I'm not the only one God has given
us Easter resurrection, Sunday, this

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.670
message of hope to take with us into the.

00:38:19.125 --> 00:38:22.695
My challenge, every single Sunday
that I get the opportunity is this,

00:38:22.875 --> 00:38:26.775
what is God calling you to take a next
step in here in a moment we're going

00:38:26.775 --> 00:38:28.305
to have something we call invitation.

00:38:28.545 --> 00:38:32.565
This is a time where you may get the
most quiet time of your whole week.

00:38:32.655 --> 00:38:35.685
Especially if you have kids being
washed back there, you don't have

00:38:35.685 --> 00:38:37.455
anything that's going on right now.

00:38:37.455 --> 00:38:40.395
This is a moment to just be
clear-minded and say this.

00:38:40.485 --> 00:38:40.785
Okay.

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:41.235
God.

00:38:42.134 --> 00:38:45.345
I heard a message from your word
about what you've done for the

00:38:45.345 --> 00:38:47.265
world, what you've done for me.

00:38:47.745 --> 00:38:48.855
What's my response.

00:38:49.095 --> 00:38:50.745
What is my next step?

00:38:51.464 --> 00:38:53.955
I think this, this is, this
is my challenge to you.

00:38:54.134 --> 00:38:58.484
Number one, your next step may
be to give your life to Jesus.

00:38:58.875 --> 00:39:01.845
It may be to say, Hey,
I've heard this message.

00:39:01.875 --> 00:39:03.495
I've heard that I can
receive grace and mercy.

00:39:03.645 --> 00:39:06.915
I've heard that I'm I'm broken
and that I, I need forgiveness.

00:39:07.065 --> 00:39:08.024
And today you can receive.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.790
How do you receive Christ is
by repenting of your sins.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:14.430
Recognize you need for God
and beginning to live for him.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.120
Perfect.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:17.279
No broken.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:18.090
Yes.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.460
Taking steps of faith every day.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.540
Yes.

00:39:22.049 --> 00:39:23.220
Do you have to do it alone?

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.950
No, because we're going to be the
family of God doing it together.

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.950
So if that's you today and you,
haven't given your life to Jesus

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.390
and you're wondering should have.

00:39:31.214 --> 00:39:33.314
What, what maybe you have
questions about them?

00:39:33.524 --> 00:39:34.605
Here's the great thing.

00:39:34.634 --> 00:39:36.944
Every single week I stayed in the back.

00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:41.865
Not because I liked the back, but because
I stayed back there for you, that darn

00:39:41.865 --> 00:39:45.734
invitation, when we're considering what
God has taught us, we go back there, you

00:39:45.734 --> 00:39:48.765
can go back there and you can say, Hey,
pastor Ben, and you just call me Ben,

00:39:48.765 --> 00:39:52.634
by the way, Hey, I got some questions
about what it means to follow Jesus.

00:39:52.634 --> 00:39:54.194
And if you do, I'll try to answer those.

00:39:54.404 --> 00:39:55.814
And maybe it's just the
starter conversation.

00:39:56.745 --> 00:39:59.265
And maybe there's a couple more
conversations we need to have, but maybe

00:39:59.265 --> 00:40:00.495
that's the first step for you to St.

00:40:00.495 --> 00:40:01.365
Have questions.

00:40:01.845 --> 00:40:05.175
So if that's you during this time of
invitation, when we start to seeing you

00:40:05.175 --> 00:40:08.955
come back there and talk to me, here's
the, the, the next thing that I think is

00:40:08.955 --> 00:40:13.845
that those of you who came in this room
that had been saved the Easter you've

00:40:13.845 --> 00:40:17.955
already celebrated Easter before you
you've been made new, you have a new life.

00:40:17.985 --> 00:40:21.015
If you've given your life to
Christ, what is the take home?

00:40:21.675 --> 00:40:22.425
Here's the take home.

00:40:24.134 --> 00:40:27.495
Live a life worthy of the message
that we've received today.

00:40:28.245 --> 00:40:28.815
Perfect.

00:40:28.845 --> 00:40:30.945
No consistent.

00:40:30.975 --> 00:40:31.545
Yes.

00:40:32.235 --> 00:40:36.975
Consistently going to Jesus and
saying, Jesus used me to do what to do.

00:40:36.975 --> 00:40:37.245
What?

00:40:39.165 --> 00:40:39.765
Think about it.

00:40:40.275 --> 00:40:43.745
God has called us to conduct
ourselves as the family of God.

00:40:43.755 --> 00:40:44.415
Be a family.

00:40:45.225 --> 00:40:46.035
God has called us.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:51.150
To be the called out once the
light of Christ to the world.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:54.450
And God has called us
to be a pillar of truth.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:57.810
All my challenge today to you is
to ask God, you're in this time of

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:04.950
invitation, how can I make Christ known
to the world, a pillar with the truth?

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.220
I don't know that answer for you, but you.

00:41:10.005 --> 00:41:11.655
Can work it out during
this time of invitation.

00:41:12.045 --> 00:41:14.745
And here's my encouragement during
this time, as we, as we transitioned

00:41:14.745 --> 00:41:17.955
to the music, I just want you to just
pray and say, Lord, what is it that I

00:41:17.955 --> 00:41:19.185
need to take a next step of faith in?

00:41:19.605 --> 00:41:23.085
If it's the next step of faith,
faith in him, then come talk to me.

00:41:23.235 --> 00:41:24.675
If it's the next step of faith to just be.

00:41:25.455 --> 00:41:26.535
Bold with your faith.

00:41:27.075 --> 00:41:28.515
Take that step, whatever it is.

00:41:28.575 --> 00:41:31.905
I challenge you to not leave out of here
today because of what Christ has done for

00:41:31.905 --> 00:41:34.245
us to not take a next step in your faith.

00:41:35.445 --> 00:41:37.395
So let's pray, Lord
Jesus, we thank you Lord.

00:41:37.395 --> 00:41:37.785
For today.

00:41:37.785 --> 00:41:40.125
We thank you for the message of hope.

00:41:42.135 --> 00:41:42.525
Jesus.

00:41:42.525 --> 00:41:45.945
Today is a day that we
celebrate you and Lord.

00:41:45.945 --> 00:41:50.415
The cool part is that we celebrate you
and then whatever we have given our lives

00:41:50.415 --> 00:41:54.135
to Christ, we get to celebrate you again
because of what you've done in our lives.

00:41:55.305 --> 00:41:57.855
But Lord that message of the living.

00:41:57.855 --> 00:42:01.605
God doesn't have to stay
here on Easter Sunday.

00:42:02.835 --> 00:42:07.004
It can be here tomorrow and the day
after, and the day after in every one

00:42:07.004 --> 00:42:10.875
of our lives, Lord, you've given us
the holy spirit to live inside of us

00:42:11.174 --> 00:42:12.555
to be the light of Christ the world.

00:42:13.455 --> 00:42:14.535
May we not leave out of here?

00:42:14.535 --> 00:42:15.495
Burdened with that?

00:42:15.765 --> 00:42:19.904
May we actually have out of here free
knowing Lord that you have committed to

00:42:19.904 --> 00:42:21.765
work through us, despite our weakness.

00:42:23.835 --> 00:42:27.255
Lord to share with others,
the hope we have in you.

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:31.275
Lord, I pray that if there's someone
in this room is struggling to take

00:42:31.275 --> 00:42:35.445
that next step of faith in you, Lord,
if it's somebody struggling to take

00:42:35.445 --> 00:42:38.325
the next step of being the light of
Christ in the world, Lord, I pray that

00:42:38.325 --> 00:42:41.955
today you remove that barrier, that
burden, and they take that next step.

00:42:42.345 --> 00:42:45.255
Lord, I pray that they come and
talk with me or they, they pray

00:42:45.255 --> 00:42:47.565
and they are so changed by the
spirit of God inside of them.

00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:48.315
Lord, that they take that.

00:42:49.605 --> 00:42:51.044
Because Lord, you are worth it.

00:42:51.105 --> 00:42:53.024
Your message of hope is worth it.

00:42:53.955 --> 00:42:55.634
And we praise you and we thank you for it.

00:42:57.024 --> 00:43:01.004
So Lord, we love you and we praise you
and we pray this in your headline name.

00:43:01.785 --> 00:43:02.115
Amen.

00:43:02.415 --> 00:43:02.714
Amen.
