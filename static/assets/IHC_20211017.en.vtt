00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.940
Um. But! Super excited about that.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.470
Um, I want to mention something today
and I'm probably gonna get in trouble

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.200
for this, but I'm going to do it.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.330
I, I, okay.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.200
So I had moments in worship where God
just reminds me of moments in my life.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.860
Where I had no clue what
the heck he was going to do.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.800
And then I go, bam. I'm
experiencing that moment.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.360
So I think I've shared this
with you guys before, right?

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.660
Faith is seeing what God sees,
even though we can't see it.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.310
So meaning there's moments in your life
where you have faith in God for something,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.489
but in that moment, you don't physically
see it, but you see God and then down the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.050
road, you see it and you go, there it is.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.830
And you go back to them.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.540
Two years ago for me.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.310
So here's just a cool story.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.550
Right?

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.480
So I've shared with you guys, as
we were planning this planning to

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.840
come and plant a church here in
Cincinnati, we begin fundraising, right?

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.010
What does it look like to fundraise?

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.519
It's where you ask people to help support
you to come and plant a church here.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.965
And, uh, there's this awesome family
back in our church that, um, I gave

00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:15.625
three years of support upfront and said,
we believe in you as a church plant.

00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:18.565
Um, and that family is here today.

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:23.545
Um, Adrian and her husband is not here,
but he is out hunting with her two boys.

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:28.225
Um, they have not only financially
supported us at the beginning of this.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:31.225
When we, that you didn't
see this two years ago.

00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:32.395
Now, now here's the thing you saw.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.015
God, you trust again.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.679
And, um, you wouldn't want this
pray, so I know God's not going

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.750
to take that reward away from you
because this isn't what it's for.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.140
Right.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.710
But this is for us to realize
guys is like all of us get to be a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.280
part of sometimes something today
where you're believing in faith.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.180
Maybe it's giving maybe it's your
faith and stepping out and trusting

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.490
God in the area of, of salvation.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.750
Maybe it's an area of ministry.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.780
I don't know what it is, but maybe
today you step out on faith and in two

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.820
years later, you look and you see this.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.000
And I, I see her worshiping with us
today and I wish her husband was here

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.710
today to see this, but because of their
faith, we are experiencing what God saw

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.240
two years ago and her and many others,
and many of you that are been investing

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.260
over these last couple of years.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.050
And that's just a beautiful picture,
guys, such a beautiful picture that

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.590
we should stop when God reveals
that to us to say, thank you, Lord.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.250
Thank you for letting me physically
see what I saw in my heart to your.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.600
Because I am praying today and I'm
believing today and a future that I can't

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.400
see yet, but I trust the guy who does,
and every day I'll invest financially.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.420
I'll invest my time.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.310
I'll invest my prayer and my commitment
and my, and the word to the Lord because

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.320
I desperately desire to see what he sees.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.420
It's so cool when we get an opportunity
to see that, but it's so important

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.310
to stop and thank God when we do.

00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:52.715
Hey man.

00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:56.205
So I haven't started preaching
yet, but that's good.

00:02:56.775 --> 00:02:59.115
So we're going to be in
Jonah chapter four today.

00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:03.765
We've been walking through the book of
Jonah for the last several weeks months.

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:05.085
Couple of months.

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:05.625
I don't know.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.205
It's not as long as we were in Ephesians,
so we've been in it for a little while.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:13.005
Um, but we've been walking through
this story and there's been some really

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:17.025
cool things that we've saw that I
believe I never saw the first time I

00:03:17.025 --> 00:03:19.005
taught through this, this book before.

00:03:19.545 --> 00:03:23.865
Um, and before we jump in, I want to
start with, uh, with really a question

00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:26.835
of where we're heading a story.

00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:29.685
And then I'll kind of summarize
where we've been and we'll jump into.

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:37.304
But has anyone in here ever,
um, been wronged by somebody?

00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:38.135
Right?

00:03:38.535 --> 00:03:41.144
Has anybody in here ever
been wrong by somebody?

00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:42.545
Right?

00:03:43.214 --> 00:03:48.105
Probably the majority of us had been
hurt by words, actions, statements.

00:03:48.105 --> 00:03:49.214
You never, you name it, right?

00:03:49.214 --> 00:03:52.054
You've been hurt by them here.

00:03:52.054 --> 00:03:52.935
Here's another question.

00:03:52.935 --> 00:03:53.924
Was it hard for you to forget?

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.060
And maybe, um, I'm going to
make even a tougher statement.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.370
Are you still trying to figure
out how to forgive them?

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.130
Are you still struggling maybe with
some unforgiveness in your life

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.990
as I get it, and today we're going
to learn a little bit about how

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.780
Jonah was blinded by bitterness.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.510
He had come to a point in his life
where he couldn't get over his

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.430
view of the people of Nineveh.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.140
To a point where he could forgive them
so that he could desire the Godwin.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.250
And so today we're going to
talk a little about that, but

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.630
I want to share a story for me.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.970
So you guys know, Hey, it's not just you.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.200
It's pastor Ben.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.770
He's struggled with bitterness
and unforgiveness in his life.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.480
So I'm going to give a brief story.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.670
And I know my mom and dad are
actually watching the service.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.500
And so they're going
to remember this story.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.330
Um, and everybody has
their different views.

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:46.185
Of what the story was, and I'm
not going to summarize, I'm just

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:47.115
gonna try to summarize it here.

00:04:47.115 --> 00:04:50.415
But when I was younger, our family
was a part of a house church.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:53.655
Basically we, we had several families
that would gather together in a home and

00:04:54.045 --> 00:04:57.705
there come to this point where there was
disagreements within what we were doing.

00:04:57.885 --> 00:05:01.155
And again, not trying to get in the
details of it, even as a kid at age 13, I

00:05:01.155 --> 00:05:04.784
didn't really know all the disagreements,
but there was just some things that were

00:05:04.784 --> 00:05:07.094
wrong, um, that were, were not right.

00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:12.115
And there was disagreements and it led
to some pretty hard issues being dealt.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.420
Well, just so happened that my dad
worked with the guy who we would call

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.490
our leader of this home church group.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.500
My dad worked with him on one day.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.090
He was there alone at work with
that man, as well as I was there.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.910
Cause it was my grandpa's shop that
we, my, my dad and him worked at.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.650
And, uh, that man who was our leader,
begin to beat my dad up really bad,

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.020
right in front of me, um, to a point
where I had to scream as loud as I could

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.610
to get the man to stop beating my dad.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.200
This is age 13.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.020
Horrible moment.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.050
My life in front of them, more of
the story you can ask me later.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.870
So obviously this really changed our
family dynamics because what happened was

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.310
one that church group, we were no longer
a part of soon after, because of some

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.620
other things, my dad lost his job and
the guy that works there kept his job.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.100
Um, and some, just some
crazy things happen.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.250
Right?

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.830
So for me, for the next 10 years,
10 years, from 13 to 23, I had a.

00:06:11.835 --> 00:06:17.865
Bitterness and unforgiveness towards that
man, there were nights where I would dream

00:06:17.865 --> 00:06:19.785
and I would wake up wanting to kill him.

00:06:20.325 --> 00:06:20.925
Yes.

00:06:21.015 --> 00:06:24.945
Your pastor, somebody who at
that point didn't know Jesus

00:06:24.975 --> 00:06:28.395
desired for this man to pay right.

00:06:29.565 --> 00:06:31.875
Bitterness unforgiveness, right.

00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:32.375
For 10 years.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.480
And one day, which I say one day,
but 10 years and really one long year

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.370
from age 22 to 23, I was involved
in a church when we finally went to

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.720
church because my daughter was born.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.310
My oldest daughter was born
and we needed to be in church.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.080
And so I spent a year dealing
with this unforgiveness and

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.570
one day on a Sunday evening.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.050
And, uh, almost now 13 years, this
January, I gave my life to Christ.

00:06:58.575 --> 00:07:02.115
And for me, and that moment was a
moment that I could see this guy,

00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:05.355
the one that had beat my dad up,
the one that had changed our life.

00:07:06.105 --> 00:07:11.565
I could see this man and not hate
him and not wish for him to die.

00:07:12.285 --> 00:07:15.495
See, recently I had an opportunity
again, it was my best friend's dad,

00:07:15.495 --> 00:07:19.275
by the way that this had happened to,
and I would even tell you this, I was.

00:07:20.715 --> 00:07:22.455
Like a couple months
old when I met this guy.

00:07:22.455 --> 00:07:25.125
So he was like a second father to
me that had done this to my dad.

00:07:25.365 --> 00:07:26.745
So my best friend's dad.

00:07:27.045 --> 00:07:30.045
Um, and I heard that he was sick
recently and then the hospital

00:07:30.045 --> 00:07:31.215
heart's not working really well.

00:07:32.145 --> 00:07:34.395
And, uh, we're going to talk
about this word compassion.

00:07:34.815 --> 00:07:36.915
So we're compassion is really,
there's such a desire to want

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:37.875
to do something about it.

00:07:38.235 --> 00:07:40.845
And so the moment I heard that had
compassion and I reached out to my friend

00:07:40.845 --> 00:07:42.405
and said, Hey, how's your dad doing?

00:07:43.034 --> 00:07:44.055
How can I pray for him?

00:07:44.085 --> 00:07:48.375
And I desperately prayed for the man
who in that time I had hated so much.

00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:56.595
Guys, we can overcome bitterness, but
bitterness can blind us, can blind us.

00:07:56.595 --> 00:07:58.665
And we're going to see how
Jonah was blinded by bitterness.

00:07:58.665 --> 00:08:01.035
And at the end of this story, I
don't think he ever overcame it.

00:08:01.455 --> 00:08:04.845
So my encouragement for you, if you don't
have a struggle with unforgiveness or

00:08:04.845 --> 00:08:07.035
maybe bitterness, and you're sitting here
saying, what does this message mean to me?

00:08:07.035 --> 00:08:09.675
We're going to learn a lot about God
today, which is going to be good to take

00:08:09.675 --> 00:08:11.085
home, but it's also things like this.

00:08:11.085 --> 00:08:11.625
We need to put in our.

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.565
We need to save for the moments
when we want to be better.

00:08:14.565 --> 00:08:17.685
We want to be unforgiving where we can
pull it back out and say, Lord, help me.

00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:19.664
Right.
We're going to learn a lot about that.

00:08:19.664 --> 00:08:23.805
So as we kind of jump into this text,
I want to kind of mention a few things

00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:25.245
as just to kind of catch you up, right?

00:08:25.245 --> 00:08:29.355
So the book of Jonah, Jonah chapter
one, Jonah gets a word from the Lord

00:08:29.414 --> 00:08:31.635
and he gets up and he runs, right.

00:08:31.635 --> 00:08:34.725
He runs from the Lord and he gets
on a boat right in this boat.

00:08:34.725 --> 00:08:37.875
There's a storm and all, all
these major things are happening

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:38.985
and finally tells the sailor.

00:08:39.449 --> 00:08:41.819
Throw me off the boat and he
gets thrown off the boat and

00:08:41.819 --> 00:08:42.689
you guys know what happens.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:45.449
He gets eaten by a big old fish
and hangs out there for three days.

00:08:45.449 --> 00:08:48.599
And finally, at the end of the, into
three days, he basically says, you

00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:51.390
know, his last words, and I love
this as my life was fading away.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.459
I remembered the Lord and
my prayer came to you.

00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:56.069
So in the last moment he says,
okay, I'm going to pray and

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:57.300
ask for you to forgive me.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.030
And the Lord spits him
out onto the dry land.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.760
And it's not the word spit it's
really vomit, which is disgusting.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.290
Right.

00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:06.150
And he says, okay, Jonah,
you get a second chance.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.510
Right?

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.370
So we see Jonah in chapter three.

00:09:09.439 --> 00:09:12.020
Getting a second chance to go
to the people of Nineveh and

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.699
preach a message from the word.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.599
And he does.

00:09:14.599 --> 00:09:18.229
He preaches whatever message the Lord
gave, gave him, even if it was shorts and

00:09:18.229 --> 00:09:21.979
the people repented, we saw all of the
people of Nineveh get a second chance.

00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:24.410
They repented and turned back to God.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.800
And that's really where we, and here
I'm going to read verse 10 of chapter

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.810
three, and then I'm going to read.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.170
Uh, the first four verses in
chapter four, just so you know why

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.670
Jonah's saying what he is saying.

00:09:35.699 --> 00:09:38.460
So it says this in verse 10, and I
don't think we have it up here, but

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.420
this in verse 10 of chapter three,
it says God saw their actions.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.090
Speaking of the Ninevites that they
had turned from their evil ways.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.620
And so God relented from the disaster
and he threatened that he had threatened

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.630
them with, and he did not do it.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:52.319
Guys.

00:09:52.319 --> 00:09:53.790
I'm going to stop right
there for just a second.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.290
When one sinner repents and turns
from God, we should celebrate.

00:09:59.925 --> 00:10:03.105
I don't care if it's just coming to
faith in Christ, or if you've been a

00:10:03.105 --> 00:10:08.385
believer for 27 years and you repent of
your sin, absolute, we should celebrate.

00:10:09.195 --> 00:10:11.475
Let's see what Jonah does says.

00:10:11.475 --> 00:10:14.625
Jonah was greatly displeased
and became furious.

00:10:15.255 --> 00:10:15.755
Wow.

00:10:16.275 --> 00:10:17.055
That's crazy.

00:10:17.745 --> 00:10:19.335
It says he prayed to the Lord, please.

00:10:19.335 --> 00:10:22.335
God, isn't this what I thought
while I was still in my own country.

00:10:22.545 --> 00:10:25.305
And that's why I fled towards
tortious in the first place.

00:10:25.635 --> 00:10:30.435
I knew that you were a gracious God and
a compassionate God and slow to anger

00:10:30.435 --> 00:10:34.485
and abounding and faithful love, and
one who relents from sending disaster.

00:10:35.295 --> 00:10:39.975
And now Lord, take my life from me for
his better, for me to die than to live.

00:10:40.485 --> 00:10:42.285
And then the Lord asked
this question to him.

00:10:42.315 --> 00:10:43.755
Is it right for you to be angry?

00:10:45.734 --> 00:10:49.454
And I would read the next verse if Jonah
responded, but Jonah didn't respond.

00:10:49.995 --> 00:10:52.775
And so we'll deal with the rest of
Jonah and a couple of weeks, but

00:10:52.775 --> 00:10:58.604
we're going to jump into this text and
see why was Jonah's heart so better?

00:10:58.604 --> 00:10:59.655
Why was he so bitter?

00:10:59.655 --> 00:11:00.854
So unforgiving.

00:11:01.604 --> 00:11:02.954
So he was blinded by bitterness.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.175
And so we're going to jump into
this and listen, let me just kind of

00:11:05.175 --> 00:11:10.334
describe this bitterness is anger and
disappointment at being treated unfairly.

00:11:10.334 --> 00:11:12.305
Let me just go a little bit
deeper usually it's because.

00:11:13.515 --> 00:11:16.635
We can't forget the things
that that person did us.

00:11:16.635 --> 00:11:17.135
Right.

00:11:17.265 --> 00:11:21.165
So bitterness is usually a product
of unforgiveness and anger.

00:11:21.525 --> 00:11:23.564
It's built up on forgiveness.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.620
And so when we look at this, it
says Jonah was greatly displeased

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.930
to the point that he became furious.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.460
And so it kind of wrote this out.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.080
I said, Jonah was having a hissy fit.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.540
Anybody ever heard of a hissy fit,
maybe your children have had that.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.230
I actually had to look it up to see
if it's actually a real word and fit.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.440
And it is it's basically
anger and frustration.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.180
He was thrown a childish, even as
an adult, a childish fit because

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.030
God did not punish them for their
sins because he forgave them.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.680
And so really, if you even look at this
first a little bit further, but what Jonah

00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:59.339
saw happen by God was evil in his sight.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.959
Think about this Jonah saying
what God did was wrong.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.250
That's what Jonah was saying.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:09.569
In that moment, he was greatly
displeased and became furious by what

00:12:09.569 --> 00:12:11.579
God did by forgiving than antibiotics.

00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:16.969
That's a pretty hard heart again, with,
we know the story of Jonah, Jonah is

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:20.900
a prophet, someone who would speak
to God and God would speak to him.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.170
This would be somebody that in
today's terms, we would call, you

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:27.410
know, even just a normal believer
that has a relationship with Jesus,

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.420
but there were some in his heart.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.530
So how did it get there?

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.609
What, what was it?

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.250
So I think we've talked about this
now, but I want to ask you guys this.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.660
Why did Jonah have this
feeling towards the Ninevites?

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.689
Why did Jonah have this feeling
towards the Ninevites somebody tell me

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:46.300
no.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.910
When you think about the story,
why did he have a, this hard heart

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.990
towards the Ninevites anybody?

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.740
Why did he not like the
Ninevites anybody know?

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:58.400
Hey, there we go.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.050
Jonas.

00:13:00.199 --> 00:13:01.010
They were terrible people.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.140
Do you remember what they did at all?

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.070
They kill people.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.520
So their enemy was Jonah's
people, the Israelites.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:14.490
So whenever they would basically come and,
you know, obviously if they were being,

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.650
um, enemies, they would destroy things.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.780
But one of the things that they did,
they were horrible to their enemies.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:24.150
They would hang them on, um, basically
poles, uh, basically impelled them with

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.730
poles and set them out in the sun to burn.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.710
They would cut off their heads
and put them at the front of the.

00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:32.640
Their gates to kind of show,
Hey, we're a cruel people, right?

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.010
So they were cruel to Jonah's people.

00:13:35.819 --> 00:13:41.310
So guys, I mean, you, you know,
this, like that sounds logical for

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.130
Jonah to be angry at these people.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.230
They were his enemies.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.180
They were horrible people.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.550
How could God forgive them?

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.439
So in that moment, I think it's easy
for us to say, man, I understand

00:13:55.439 --> 00:13:56.730
why Jonah had this heart, but.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.199
We have to continue to grow from this.

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:02.370
And this is where we're going to look at.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:02.670
Right?

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.939
So I know there's many people in
this room, including myself, who

00:14:05.939 --> 00:14:10.050
at moments have felt like we knew
what was best in a situation.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:10.550
Right.

00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:12.180
I know what's best in the situation.

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:15.180
Um, especially someone who's wrongness.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.880
I know how they should be punished.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.229
I know how they should act.

00:14:19.229 --> 00:14:20.550
I know how they should respond.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.310
We have all had those moments.

00:14:24.255 --> 00:14:27.495
And so here's the thing I think we
could relate with Jonah in this.

00:14:27.795 --> 00:14:30.555
And if we want to go a step further,
if we want to go even more like in

00:14:30.555 --> 00:14:33.705
the new Testament, we probably relate
well with the disciples that followed

00:14:33.705 --> 00:14:37.065
Jesus, two of Jesus's closest disciples.

00:14:37.065 --> 00:14:37.815
Here's what they said.

00:14:37.815 --> 00:14:40.395
Whenever Jesus had sent them
ahead of them, I'm going to

00:14:40.395 --> 00:14:42.315
read this Luke 9 54 said this.

00:14:42.825 --> 00:14:43.995
Um, and this is speaking of Jesus.

00:14:43.995 --> 00:14:46.125
He says he sent messages ahead of himself.

00:14:46.515 --> 00:14:50.505
And on the way they entered a village
of the Samaritans to make preparations

00:14:50.505 --> 00:14:53.205
for him, but they did not welcome him.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.580
And because he determined
to journey to Jerusalem.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.830
Um, when the disciples, James and
John saw this, they said, Lord,

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.400
do you want us to cast down fire
from heaven to consume them?

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.880
So just so you get this point,
Jesus asked them to go get some,

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.360
some places set up for him, his
coming and they didn't welcome him.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.060
So what's the initial
response by these guys.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.520
If they're not going to welcome
Jesus, we need to cast down

00:15:17.939 --> 00:15:19.319
fire from heaven and consume.

00:15:19.965 --> 00:15:21.314
That was James and John.

00:15:21.675 --> 00:15:23.985
Some of Jesus' closest
followers wanted to do that.

00:15:24.064 --> 00:15:27.555
You know, what did Jesus, his response,
but he turned and rebuke them.

00:15:28.485 --> 00:15:29.564
Jesus rebuked him.

00:15:30.825 --> 00:15:36.885
You know, I think about this is I think
there's times where I'm in traffic and

00:15:36.885 --> 00:15:40.905
I want to call it on fire on some of the
people that are stupid in front of me.

00:15:41.955 --> 00:15:42.285
You know?

00:15:42.285 --> 00:15:44.925
I mean, we, we get in these
moments where we feel like we

00:15:44.925 --> 00:15:48.105
know what's right, but God.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.070
Rebukes us.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.290
And he says, no, it's not.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:56.550
So, so let me ask this question then what
should be our response when God forgives

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.270
someone and I'll go a little bit, step
further, what should be a response when

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:04.560
God doesn't punish someone the way we
want to, what should be your response?

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.370
When, when, when God forgives
somebody, what should be your response?

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.960
So, you know, I actually speak in service
and I invite a lot of conversation back.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.620
I actually love it.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.730
So what, what should, what should we do
when somebody actually turns from the.

00:16:19.535 --> 00:16:20.315
Celebrate.

00:16:21.005 --> 00:16:24.515
I'm glad you said that because the word
of God actually affirms that, uh, we

00:16:24.515 --> 00:16:27.065
should rejoice Luke 15 seven says this.

00:16:27.425 --> 00:16:32.315
I tell you in the same way, there will
be more joy in heaven, over one sinner

00:16:32.315 --> 00:16:36.335
who repents than over 99 righteous
people who don't need repentance.

00:16:37.265 --> 00:16:40.865
Here's the reason I want to say that
he says over one person, the repents.

00:16:41.165 --> 00:16:43.415
If we go down a little bit later
and I know I've been quoting this

00:16:43.415 --> 00:16:46.505
wrong until just recently, but
the 120,000 people in Nineveh.

00:16:47.235 --> 00:16:48.435
Repented of their sins.

00:16:49.215 --> 00:16:53.945
If there's one person that
repents, it says basically that

00:16:53.955 --> 00:16:57.915
they're throwing a party in heaven
for him over 120,000 people.

00:16:58.095 --> 00:17:05.845
There's probably a huge part of this going
on for days over this and for us, for us

00:17:05.845 --> 00:17:11.214
to not celebrate when somebody is forgiven
of their sins, when somebody has given

00:17:11.214 --> 00:17:15.655
their life to Christ and when somebody
has even wronged you, but yet they truly.

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:18.639
Ask God to forgive them and moved on.

00:17:18.639 --> 00:17:21.730
We should celebrate because I'm not saying
it's easy, but I'm just telling you what

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.139
the word of God says that we should do.

00:17:23.139 --> 00:17:23.639
Right.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.859
If again, if the heaven is
throwing a party than we should.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.230
And so here's just a side statement.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.790
If you're running from repentance, because
you're fearful of what that looks like.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.270
The Bible clearly says running to
repentance actually is a good thing.

00:17:38.145 --> 00:17:39.465
Running to repentance is a good thing.

00:17:39.465 --> 00:17:41.055
You should run to it, right.

00:17:41.085 --> 00:17:42.075
Run to repentance.

00:17:42.105 --> 00:17:42.735
It's a good thing.

00:17:43.245 --> 00:17:47.205
So God longs for people to repent
and receive his grace and mercy.

00:17:48.014 --> 00:17:49.125
And I just, I made this statement.

00:17:49.125 --> 00:17:52.004
I just, as I think about how, how
he loves weak and broken people,

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:54.639
And here's the thing, guys.

00:17:54.639 --> 00:17:56.860
I want, I want, wanna, I want to try
to be as clear as I came with this.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.090
I don't know what you've gone through.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.850
So this isn't me saying it.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.090
I don't care what you've gone through.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.969
You may have been abused and that's not
what I'm sitting here saying is okay.

00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:06.879
And that you, you need to get
past your, your, your, your

00:18:06.879 --> 00:18:08.050
frustration towards that person.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:12.100
What I'm trying to communicate here
is God knows what you've been through.

00:18:12.969 --> 00:18:18.189
God knows what that person said did
to you, but I want to be clear here.

00:18:18.189 --> 00:18:19.840
And this is what I
think the word is clear.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:25.320
Here's what God is not saying when he
forgives those who are, have wrong to you.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.560
He's not saying to that
person, Hey, it's okay.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.490
How you treated that person?

00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:33.929
He's not saying, Hey, it's totally
fine that you said that to that person.

00:18:33.959 --> 00:18:35.520
He's also not saying, Hey, it's okay.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.449
How you reacted?

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.580
God doesn't.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.879
And I want you to hear this
whenever God forgives sin, he

00:18:41.879 --> 00:18:44.010
doesn't condone the actions of the.

00:18:45.285 --> 00:18:48.135
He actually recognizes them
as horrible and damaging.

00:18:48.615 --> 00:18:51.975
Not only to the person they hurt,
but to the person who did the act.

00:18:52.455 --> 00:18:55.455
So I'm gonna say that again, when God
forgives sin, he doesn't condone the

00:18:55.455 --> 00:18:57.225
actions of the center too many times.

00:18:57.225 --> 00:19:02.055
When we look at God and he forgives these
people that are so horrible, we thank God.

00:19:02.055 --> 00:19:02.715
How could you do this?

00:19:02.715 --> 00:19:07.455
But God is actually just as
frustrated at the sin as.

00:19:08.699 --> 00:19:12.090
Maybe even more so because he didn't
just those people, whenever they wronged

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.230
you, they didn't just sit against you.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.340
They sinned against God.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:20.129
So God is absolutely frustrated
and angry and hurt over how

00:19:20.129 --> 00:19:21.240
you were hurt by someone.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.250
But God.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.620
Doesn't can go in them, right?

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.060
He still says this, and
I want you to see this.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.720
That's why God relents when someone or
Pence, and this is the important part.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.290
When someone repents, they get
it, they know they did wrong.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.750
They know they should be eternally
punished and they know they should be

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.910
begging God like the king did before them.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:43.110
And we saw this last week where the king
set an example of what true repentance is.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:47.340
So, so you know this, God's not sitting
there for giving people who don't truly

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.750
repent, who don't truly feel sorry.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.070
And you guys know this, you have kids.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.380
If you don't have kids, you
probably have seen kids this way.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:52.980
Maybe you acted.

00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:54.405
Right.

00:19:54.405 --> 00:19:56.564
You say, Hey, say, sorry
to your brother, sorry.

00:19:57.074 --> 00:19:59.264
God's not looking at that and
saying, that's true repentance.

00:20:00.044 --> 00:20:02.475
No, he's saying you have a heart
issue you need to get, so this

00:20:02.475 --> 00:20:04.155
is people who truly repent.

00:20:04.574 --> 00:20:07.905
God celebrates because they recognize
the same thing he recognized.

00:20:07.905 --> 00:20:11.625
And the same thing you recognize when you
were hurt, that they were wrong and they

00:20:11.625 --> 00:20:13.155
don't only want to be forgiven of it.

00:20:13.514 --> 00:20:15.764
They want to overcome it and turn from it.

00:20:16.185 --> 00:20:17.685
So we should celebrate for these things.

00:20:19.395 --> 00:20:22.815
So we're going to jump into diverse
too, cause there's, there's more here.

00:20:22.815 --> 00:20:23.775
So let's look at verse two.

00:20:23.775 --> 00:20:26.505
It says he prayed to
the Lord, please, Lord.

00:20:26.505 --> 00:20:27.855
And again, he went to the right place.

00:20:27.855 --> 00:20:31.095
He's praying to the Lord, but his,
his words and his heart is not right.

00:20:31.545 --> 00:20:34.245
It says he prayed to the Lord
and the Lord, he says, please

00:20:34.245 --> 00:20:37.665
Lord, isn't this what I thought
while I was still on my own.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.390
That's why I fled towards
Tarsus in the first place.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.450
I knew that you were gracious and
compassionate and slow to anger,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.930
abounding in faith love and the one
who relents from sending the disaster.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.160
So I know if we look at this statement,
just like Jonah, we can struggle

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.570
with the idea of forgiveness, right.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.150
Especially towards our enemy,
especially towards our enemy.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:02.750
But I think the interesting thing
with this is Jonah knew the answer

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.510
that God was going to forgive them
all the way back in chapter one.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.460
This is the point where we truly see.

00:21:08.665 --> 00:21:13.045
Jonah's bitterness and how it was
controlling him back in chapter one.

00:21:13.045 --> 00:21:15.565
When the Lord said, go to
Nineveh and preach against it.

00:21:15.985 --> 00:21:18.895
Jonah knew at that moment, when
he fled to Tarsha says, this

00:21:18.895 --> 00:21:19.855
is what this verse is saying.

00:21:20.185 --> 00:21:21.595
He knew God would forgive them.

00:21:21.595 --> 00:21:25.014
If he went, he probably knew God would
forgive them, even if he didn't go,

00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.215
because God would find somebody else.

00:21:26.215 --> 00:21:29.425
If Jonah never ended up going
Jonah, wasn't okay with it.

00:21:30.295 --> 00:21:31.945
Jonah was not okay with it.

00:21:31.945 --> 00:21:32.445
Right.

00:21:32.665 --> 00:21:33.205
And I think that's.

00:21:34.719 --> 00:21:37.570
So what I want to, I want to encourage you
in this, because I think this is important

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.719
for us to, to walk through and think
through Jonah had the right theology.

00:21:40.719 --> 00:21:43.810
And so whenever I say the word theology
it's Jonah had the right understanding

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.760
of God's word, that he was right.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.350
Compassionate and gracious, but he
had the wrong attitude towards it.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.550
Jonah understood God's word.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.679
He understood that he was gracious.

00:21:57.345 --> 00:22:00.795
And forgiving and compassionate,
but his attitude was wrong.

00:22:00.825 --> 00:22:01.845
So let me ask this question.

00:22:01.845 --> 00:22:05.355
You ever been in a situation where
you knew you should respond and act

00:22:05.355 --> 00:22:09.615
a certain way, but you rejected it
and acted like you wanted anybody.

00:22:10.155 --> 00:22:12.885
You knew that it wasn't
right to say this or right.

00:22:12.885 --> 00:22:15.675
To act this way, but you
rejected that feeling and you

00:22:15.735 --> 00:22:17.415
acted the way you wanted to.

00:22:19.395 --> 00:22:19.895
Yeah.

00:22:20.085 --> 00:22:21.945
You guys know where you're stepping.

00:22:21.945 --> 00:22:22.385
Yeah.
Yes.

00:22:22.385 --> 00:22:23.085
You understand it.

00:22:23.085 --> 00:22:23.415
Right.

00:22:23.415 --> 00:22:24.254
Jonah did the same thing.

00:22:25.965 --> 00:22:27.794
He was blinded by bitterness.

00:22:27.794 --> 00:22:31.485
And here's the moment guys, the moment
that we respond in the flesh, the way we

00:22:31.485 --> 00:22:37.335
want to is the moment that we're blinded
really by that anger or unforgiveness or

00:22:37.335 --> 00:22:39.675
frustration or bitterness, whatever it is.

00:22:40.544 --> 00:22:42.165
And so here, here's why I say this.

00:22:42.855 --> 00:22:43.815
A lot of us are like Jonah.

00:22:43.815 --> 00:22:47.955
In this instance, we want to look
at God's word and we want to say,

00:22:47.955 --> 00:22:49.845
okay, God forgives my mistakes.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.970
But we quickly want to look at somebody
else's and we want to say, but not theirs.

00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:59.190
We want to withhold that from someone
else, because we think, you know, our

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:00.570
relationship is different than theirs.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.320
You know, God looks at us better
than no, no, God looks at all of

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.379
us the same way as a, what is it?

00:23:07.379 --> 00:23:11.460
Sheep without a shepherd
hurting and broken.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.590
And he desires all of us
to come to faith in him.

00:23:14.129 --> 00:23:15.240
So we are all important.

00:23:15.945 --> 00:23:20.895
So again, Jonah wanted his ride theology,
understanding God's word, right.

00:23:21.075 --> 00:23:22.725
Applied to him in chapter two.

00:23:22.725 --> 00:23:23.475
And that's where we looked at.

00:23:23.475 --> 00:23:25.575
I know you guys, maybe if you weren't
in here, you didn't see this, but

00:23:25.575 --> 00:23:29.504
in chapter two, Jonah wanted to
be forgiven and God forgave him.

00:23:30.225 --> 00:23:33.675
Chapter three, Jonah didn't
want the people that need to be

00:23:33.675 --> 00:23:34.965
forgiven, but they were forgiven.

00:23:35.805 --> 00:23:39.135
He liked Jonah chapter two being
forgiven, but he didn't like

00:23:39.135 --> 00:23:40.034
John chapter three of them being.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:43.770
You've never, probably been that
way towards somebody where you,

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:44.850
you want to withhold forgiveness.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:49.850
You don't want to see them, you know, ever
basically it'd be okay that they're there.

00:23:49.879 --> 00:23:51.300
They're not punished for their sins.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:51.510
Right.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.750
You want to make sure you do that
for, for God, because God can't do it.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:55.740
I've been there.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.350
I've been there and I get it.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.429
I get it.

00:23:59.429 --> 00:24:01.919
And so does Jonah, this
is why I've encouraged.

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:05.550
You don't give Jonah a hard time because
many times the longer we peer into the

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.649
story of Jonah, we don't see Jonah's name.

00:24:07.649 --> 00:24:08.149
We see.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.199
And that is convicting not only to
me, but I hope it's convicting to you.

00:24:13.199 --> 00:24:13.699
Right?

00:24:14.129 --> 00:24:18.659
And so if God's word is true and I believe
it is, it applies to everyone the same.

00:24:18.989 --> 00:24:21.510
So we have to understand that God
will be compassionate towards people.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.750
We don't like we disagree
with and have wrongness.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:29.010
And here's an interesting thought
who knows you might be the person

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:32.909
that God forgives that someone
else doesn't like that you hurt.

00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:37.320
And so whenever you start placing yourself
as the person, that's probably hurts them.

00:24:38.325 --> 00:24:39.405
And needed forgiveness.

00:24:39.435 --> 00:24:43.095
You start realizing how important it
is that we don't hold that forgiveness

00:24:43.095 --> 00:24:44.835
over unforgiveness over someone else.

00:24:44.835 --> 00:24:45.335
Right.

00:24:45.795 --> 00:24:47.505
And I, so let's look at
verse three real quick.

00:24:47.505 --> 00:24:51.135
I want to, I want us to see this,
this part here in verse three.

00:24:51.555 --> 00:24:55.725
This is what Jonas Jonas,
Jonas, but Jonah says it's this.

00:24:55.725 --> 00:24:59.595
And now Lord, take my life from me for
it is better for me to die than to live.

00:25:00.885 --> 00:25:03.225
So Jonah's response to God's word.

00:25:04.495 --> 00:25:07.044
Basically applying that he's
willing to forgive anybody.

00:25:07.075 --> 00:25:10.675
Even his enemies is I'd rather
die than to see this come true.

00:25:12.975 --> 00:25:20.125
Anybody see how this is such a sign
of bitterness and anger for Jonah?

00:25:20.305 --> 00:25:23.305
Like if you don't see it at this
point that he was willing to just die.

00:25:24.764 --> 00:25:26.475
I don't want to see these
people with being forgiven.

00:25:26.504 --> 00:25:27.705
I'd rather just die.

00:25:28.245 --> 00:25:33.824
He's so blinded by it guys that
he can't celebrate something huge.

00:25:35.294 --> 00:25:36.855
I want to encourage you in this.

00:25:36.855 --> 00:25:40.665
This is so important in ministry
and our Christian lives.

00:25:41.415 --> 00:25:45.165
If God is blessing someone else, if
God is doing something amazing in

00:25:45.165 --> 00:25:50.024
their life and you feel like he's not
in yours, don't tell God to kill you

00:25:50.024 --> 00:25:51.135
because you don't want to celebrate.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.740
I'm just going to step
out there a little bit.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:58.639
I mean, so you want to say, Hey, well,
why are you saying that for us guys?

00:25:58.639 --> 00:26:00.950
There's times where I have to get
off social media, because I'm,

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:03.740
I'm seeing other church planters
and I'm seeing good things happen.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.439
And you know what happens in my heart,
Lord, why are you doing that to them?

00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:07.070
And not to me?

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.590
And that moment, the Lord,
the spirit comes upon me.

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.939
He says, what the heck are you doing?

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:15.210
And I have to step away and
I have to address my heart

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.370
and say, Lord, this is wrong.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:17.940
Why?

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.600
And this is why guys, we live in a
world and in a flesh that is sinful.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.010
And we will always battle that.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.180
But the word of the Lord is so
important to wash over us and the

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.540
grace of the Lord, which was extended
to Jonah, which was extended to the

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.520
Ninevites is extended to you and me in.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.590
But one of the things that Jonah
missed guys is he didn't recognize

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.020
that he never came to the point
of saying, God, I'm broken.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:42.230
Help me get past this and celebrate this.

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.310
He didn't get there.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:45.140
He just ignored the Lord.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.260
So Jonah was blinded by bitterness.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:48.760
Right.

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.170
And we can become that same way.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.550
Right.
So how do we overcome it?

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:55.130
How do we deal with bitterness
and anger and unforgiveness?

00:26:56.399 --> 00:26:58.500
I'm glad you asked this question
because I think this text

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.210
actually speaks directly to it.

00:27:00.659 --> 00:27:03.720
So we have to know that God is not
only compassionate to our enemies,

00:27:04.139 --> 00:27:06.060
but he's also compassionate to us.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.240
So I would say this, this is,
this is my last statement.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.970
Run to the father.

00:27:12.659 --> 00:27:16.919
When you are struggling to forgive,
when you are struggling to get over

00:27:16.919 --> 00:27:22.139
your anger or your bitterness, there's
only one place to go is to the Lord.

00:27:22.889 --> 00:27:26.820
And his word because it will
wash over us and teach us.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.740
So what is compassion?

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:28.949
Right.

00:27:28.949 --> 00:27:31.860
I want to kind of break down again,
go back to chapter or verse two

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.300
here and look at these words.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.850
This is, I knew that you were
gracious and compassionate.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.100
So grace has given us
something we don't deserve.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.500
So God desires, even in your brokenness
and your struggle with unforgiveness to

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.040
give you something you don't deserve,
he desires to give you compassion.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.150
And I want to talk about compassion.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.780
Again, compassion is the emotion that
arises when you're confronted with

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:56.040
one another one suffering and you feel
motivated to relieve that suffering.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.850
I give it this way.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.260
This is a great way to think about it.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:04.980
When you are starving and hungry and you
want to remove, leave that hunger pain.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.070
When you are compassionate towards
someone, you see a need and you

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:16.350
desire so much to fulfill that
need that you have to do it right.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:18.360
God and his sovereignty.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:23.040
And his love for us was compassionate
towards us when he sent us on

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.080
Jesus, because Jesus saw us in
our suffering from our sins.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:28.290
Right.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:31.590
And he desired to relieve it just
as he did for the people of Nineveh.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:33.090
See God.

00:28:34.399 --> 00:28:37.820
It's compassionate towards you, even
in your brokenness, even in your

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.840
struggle to forgive, even in your
struggle with bitterness or whatever

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.830
it is that you're dealing with.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:44.600
God is compassionate.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.500
And so the only way that Jonah could
have overcome his bitterness is the

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.540
same way that we can overcome it.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:51.040
Right.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:52.639
And the same way that the people did.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:53.060
Right.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.560
And I want you to, I want you to see this.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.190
We begin to overcome our
bitterness when we recognize

00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:59.899
we can overcome it apart from.

00:29:00.945 --> 00:29:01.905
I'll just tell you this.

00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:03.405
I don't know what sin
you're struggling with.

00:29:03.405 --> 00:29:07.635
So if you may be hearing today and saying
this message doesn't apply to me, Ben, it

00:29:07.635 --> 00:29:10.065
absolutely does because God's compassion.

00:29:10.065 --> 00:29:14.385
Grace Love and mercy is extended to anyone
who's struggling with sin in their life.

00:29:14.895 --> 00:29:16.305
And this is what God says.

00:29:16.665 --> 00:29:20.085
He says, you can overcome
it with me, right?

00:29:20.235 --> 00:29:24.075
Because apart from God, we
can't, we cannot heal from

00:29:24.075 --> 00:29:26.055
that, which we will not admit.

00:29:26.055 --> 00:29:26.715
And so I'm gonna say the same.

00:29:26.715 --> 00:29:29.355
We cannot heal from that,
which we're unwilling to it.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.280
So I don't, I'm telling you, I
mentioned the last week guys,

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.570
we had to confess our sins.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:37.810
We have to recognize our need for God.

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:40.600
And if we will not be willing
to admit it just like Jonah

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.910
didn't will never overcome it.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.120
Jonah was unwilling to do this, and I
want to encourage you with this when

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.120
it comes to bitterness, because this
is a statement that just, it hits.

00:29:50.485 --> 00:29:53.635
You know, when we think of not
forgiving someone or we're holding a

00:29:53.635 --> 00:29:56.635
grudge towards someone, we think we're
hurting them and heard this statement.

00:29:56.965 --> 00:29:59.635
Someone once said that bitterness
is like drinking poison and

00:29:59.635 --> 00:30:00.655
hoping it kills your enemy.

00:30:01.705 --> 00:30:04.045
Unforgiveness bitterness
is that same thing.

00:30:04.435 --> 00:30:08.935
When you hold that is affecting you
way more than it's affecting the

00:30:08.935 --> 00:30:10.165
person you're wanting to hold it over.

00:30:11.095 --> 00:30:14.785
It has not meant for you
to be in that condition.

00:30:16.169 --> 00:30:19.980
So verse four, verse four says
this, the Lord asks and it is right,

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.750
is it right for you to be angry?

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:23.760
And again, Jonah didn't
ever answer that question.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.530
He refused to accept it.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:30.230
So the Lord is sitting there saying
this, and this is what I would want

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:35.370
you to not miss at that moment of burst
three, Lord has the power and I would

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:39.840
say this, he has the right to look at
Jonah and grant his wish and kill him.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.350
But you guys remember me
mentioning a couple of weeks ago

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:44.280
that Jonah got a second chance.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:50.820
This verse describes the third chance
because God didn't destroy him.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:55.200
He's actually trying to bring
something about in Jonah's heart.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:58.170
He says, this is it right
for you to be angry.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.880
I'm just telling you that's
called long suffering from God.

00:31:03.705 --> 00:31:06.495
That continues to pursue us,
even though we reject him.

00:31:06.975 --> 00:31:10.395
And this picture in his first
was important for me guys,

00:31:10.425 --> 00:31:13.035
because there's times where I
feel like every day I fail him.

00:31:13.335 --> 00:31:15.975
And I wonder if the Lord is saying
anything to me and you know, the

00:31:15.975 --> 00:31:18.195
Lord is actually pointing it out,
is it right for you to be angry?

00:31:18.195 --> 00:31:20.025
Ben, is it right for you to do that?

00:31:20.025 --> 00:31:23.865
It's not, but that's the Lord's way
of saying I'm not done with you yet.

00:31:24.135 --> 00:31:25.785
God was not done with Joni yet.

00:31:26.085 --> 00:31:28.755
He still wanted to do
something in Jonah and through.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.980
But we see God was gracious, right?

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:36.820
God will continue to walk with us through
all of our struggles and bitterness.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.630
And I think so much to this God's love
for the one is just as strong as the

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:45.670
love for the 120,000 that he was leading
to repentance right through Jonah.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.050
But I want you to see
this verse in this way.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.270
God was trying to get Jonas.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:58.140
In this verse for Jonah, it was God trying
to remind him in that moment that he

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:03.150
was giving Jonah the same mercy, grace
and grace that God had given Nineveh.

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:09.030
All of us are in some way like Jonah
in some shape or form, aren't we right.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.840
We, we look at God and we say, when
it applies to us, we almost expect it.

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.690
We take it for granted that yo
man, God's going to forgive me,

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.160
God, you know, God's gonna do this.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.030
God's gonna do that for me.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:20.820
But will we begin to judge others?

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.780
And we don't want to extend that to.

00:32:22.665 --> 00:32:26.385
Why don't we forget for quickly
forget the all of us have sinned

00:32:26.385 --> 00:32:27.705
and fallen short of God's glory.

00:32:27.735 --> 00:32:28.725
None of us are perfect.

00:32:28.845 --> 00:32:30.795
All of us need that grace that God gives.

00:32:31.635 --> 00:32:35.025
So if we're able to receive
it, then isn't our enemies.

00:32:36.585 --> 00:32:40.545
God has not called us to be judge and
jury over who gets grace and who doesn't.

00:32:40.665 --> 00:32:41.165
Right.

00:32:41.415 --> 00:32:44.115
And if we leave bitterness
unchecked, here's what I promise you.

00:32:44.535 --> 00:32:47.205
If you leave any sin
unchecked, it will affect.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.390
All of your life, it will affect
every aspect of your life.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.400
And your walk with Jesus will be hindered.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.510
So if you are a believer in Christ
and you have sent in your life, it is

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:02.100
important to deal with it because it will
hinder your walk and following Jesus.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:05.840
And if you're saying, well, I don't know
if I have sin, if you'll take time and

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:11.520
seek God's word, it will be clear what is
in your heart that you need to work on.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.020
Right.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.000
But I'm just gonna kind
of finish this way.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.440
Cause I know we're, we're
running out of time here.

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:18.510
I love ending.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.240
Am I, again, my wife has done a
great job of reminding me this.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.850
I love ending every message this way.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.410
What does this text say about God,
ultimately, guys, what is this text?

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.750
What does this scripture say about God?

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.720
And I would just, I'm going to
kind of summarize it here for you.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.770
Whether you're in the place of the people
of Nineveh who have done something.

00:33:39.265 --> 00:33:40.885
If you're in that place,
you've done something horrible.

00:33:40.885 --> 00:33:41.375
You've wrong.

00:33:41.375 --> 00:33:45.445
Someone, whether you're in that place
or whether you're in the place of Jonah,

00:33:45.445 --> 00:33:48.835
where you're bitter towards someone and
you're holding unforgiveness, or whether

00:33:48.835 --> 00:33:54.685
you're somewhere in between, God is
gracious and compassionate towards you.

00:33:55.225 --> 00:33:57.925
He is slow to anger and he
is abounding a faithful love.

00:33:57.925 --> 00:34:00.415
And he is one who will
relent from disaster.

00:34:00.865 --> 00:34:03.605
That's the God we serve because God loves.

00:34:04.605 --> 00:34:07.335
Even in your brokenness now he
says, I want you to stay that way.

00:34:07.485 --> 00:34:08.235
I think that's so important.

00:34:08.235 --> 00:34:09.735
He does not want you to stay that way.

00:34:10.095 --> 00:34:11.565
He desires for a better life.

00:34:11.595 --> 00:34:14.325
And this is the thing I
continued to communicate.

00:34:14.715 --> 00:34:18.495
When we talk about sin so many times,
it's like, well, it's the major

00:34:18.495 --> 00:34:19.575
sins we need to focus on, right?

00:34:19.575 --> 00:34:23.205
No, it's any sin and sin as anything
we thank say, do or don't do that.

00:34:23.205 --> 00:34:26.085
Displeases God is it's really
anything against God's.

00:34:26.575 --> 00:34:29.025
What was a person who he is, right?

00:34:29.085 --> 00:34:33.195
God and his love and his mercy and
his grace and his compassion towards.

00:34:34.065 --> 00:34:36.764
I would say this, God is
saying this about your sin.

00:34:37.125 --> 00:34:39.315
Your sin is not his best for you.

00:34:39.824 --> 00:34:40.965
He has something better.

00:34:40.965 --> 00:34:43.605
So when we repent and turn from
God, there's something better

00:34:43.605 --> 00:34:44.835
on the other side of that.

00:34:45.105 --> 00:34:48.645
So withholding repentance is actually
not experiencing God's best for you.

00:34:49.514 --> 00:34:53.534
I think that changes my perspective of
my sin because I want God's best because

00:34:53.534 --> 00:34:56.025
I know he has something greater for me.

00:34:56.205 --> 00:34:58.935
And many times on the other
side of repentance is freedom.

00:34:59.865 --> 00:35:00.585
It's peace.

00:35:01.904 --> 00:35:02.404
It's love.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.230
It's something.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:09.490
What I would say is, is amazing that
we get to experience this side of

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:13.960
heaven that, that I'm telling you guys
when we get there, it's wonderful.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.370
But it's a daily process.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.860
Cause I'm telling you this
just as a pastor, I, I repent

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.530
every day of sins, right?

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:24.190
Uh, the things I think towards
somebody, the things I think about

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.490
the things I don't think about,
the things I don't prioritize, I'm

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:28.870
constantly have to say, God, forgive me.

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:30.370
I know that I need your help.

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.530
So.

00:35:32.235 --> 00:35:33.285
An order to receive this.

00:35:33.285 --> 00:35:37.455
I want to kind of in this way, guys,
as we go into invitation, what is

00:35:37.455 --> 00:35:40.365
the purpose of invitation is time to
reflect what God speak to you about.

00:35:40.365 --> 00:35:43.665
I pray that God spoke to you,
something through this word for you

00:35:43.665 --> 00:35:45.255
to consider what it got, speak to me.

00:35:45.255 --> 00:35:46.245
And what does that mean to me?

00:35:46.605 --> 00:35:50.355
But I kind of want to mention just
a few things maybe for you, right?

00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:53.595
Um, we see this, this, this
things I mentioned, right?

00:35:53.685 --> 00:35:56.565
Grace and compassion and
how God slow to anger.

00:35:56.565 --> 00:35:57.795
Maybe you want to receive this.

00:35:57.795 --> 00:35:58.295
Maybe you.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.110
Already given your life to Christ
and you just need to receive these

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:03.750
things again for something in
your life that you're dealing with

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:04.950
in order for us to receive it.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:05.820
I want to ask this question.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.070
What does it take to receive it?

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:11.430
What does it take to receive God's love
and compassion and mercy and grace?

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:13.020
Somebody tell me what does it take?

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:20.140
Simple, but talking about it,
what's it take repetitive.

00:36:22.375 --> 00:36:26.665
You know, God doesn't pull grace back
here and he says, hope you can find it.

00:36:26.845 --> 00:36:28.255
It's always there.

00:36:28.255 --> 00:36:28.825
Waiting.

00:36:29.185 --> 00:36:32.635
Forgiveness is always there waiting
on the other side of repentance

00:36:33.745 --> 00:36:35.005
on the other side of repentance.

00:36:35.035 --> 00:36:37.945
So today when we go into
invitation, there's some of us

00:36:38.665 --> 00:36:39.835
there dealing with bitterness.

00:36:41.575 --> 00:36:42.625
You know what Jesus is saying?

00:36:42.685 --> 00:36:45.355
Come to me, all you who are weary
and burdened, and I will give you.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:49.259
There are some of us who are dealing
with guilt over our sins of wrong

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:51.210
actions, towards someone or towards God.

00:36:51.569 --> 00:36:52.710
You know what Jesus is saying?

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:57.270
Come to me all you who are weary and
burdened, and I will give you rest.

00:36:59.049 --> 00:37:03.220
There is nothing that God is saying.

00:37:03.279 --> 00:37:03.970
Don't come to me about.

00:37:04.859 --> 00:37:07.620
So during this time of invitation,
come before the Lord, open your

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.950
hearts to him and say, Lord, where
is it that I'm falling short?

00:37:11.339 --> 00:37:13.859
And if it's not anything to do with
this message, and you're knocking it

00:37:13.859 --> 00:37:17.100
out of the park, pray that God uses
this message to encourage someone who

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.649
isn't, whatever it is, seek the Lord in.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.420
But the last statement is this.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.670
If you've never given your life
to Christ, if you don't know what

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:28.050
it is to follow Jesus and receive
grace and mercy and know who God is.

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:30.660
And you're confused about
everything maybe was spoke to today.

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:32.130
I want you to come talk to me.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:35.190
If you want to know how to accept
Christ and be forgiven of your

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.600
sins, I want you to talk to me.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.170
It's the greatest thing, greatest
decision you'll ever make in your life.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.060
It changed my life almost 13 years
ago, 13 years ago, I gave my life

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.960
to Christ on a Sunday night and it
took me a solid year to get over

00:37:49.319 --> 00:37:51.089
realizing I couldn't do it on my own.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.770
And for you maybe the
same way don't miss today.

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:57.029
Today's the day of salvation.

00:37:57.029 --> 00:37:59.670
You never know if tomorrow is
promised and that's not for you

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:00.930
to be scared into salvation.

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:04.470
That's for you to be motivated to
deal with it today and not put it off.

00:38:06.795 --> 00:38:09.045
So during this time of invitation,
I'm going to stand in the back.

00:38:09.045 --> 00:38:11.985
I love staying in the back because I
want you to feel comfortable to not

00:38:11.985 --> 00:38:13.095
feel like you're up in front of people.

00:38:13.095 --> 00:38:14.865
If you have questions, but that
you can come ask questions.

00:38:14.865 --> 00:38:15.945
Maybe it's about the message.

00:38:16.215 --> 00:38:18.885
Maybe it's about to follow
Jesus, but come talk to me.

00:38:18.885 --> 00:38:20.625
I'd love to pray with
you and encourage you.

00:38:21.075 --> 00:38:24.015
Um, but outside of that, I want
you guys to ask the Lord what he is

00:38:24.015 --> 00:38:26.115
teaching you, repent of your sin.

00:38:26.115 --> 00:38:29.205
If you've got it in your heart
and give it over to the Lord.

00:38:29.565 --> 00:38:32.475
So let's pray, Lord Jesus, we
thank you Lord for your word

00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:33.405
because we know it's true.

00:38:34.305 --> 00:38:35.925
Laura.
No today's text was hard.

00:38:36.855 --> 00:38:40.305
I know it's hard Lord, because there's
many of us in this room that may have

00:38:40.305 --> 00:38:43.785
came in these doors, not knowing they
were going to be dealing and confronted

00:38:43.785 --> 00:38:48.825
with the unforgiveness in their heart
or the envy in their heart or the Lord

00:38:48.825 --> 00:38:51.255
lack of just compassion in their heart.

00:38:51.255 --> 00:38:55.515
Lord, I don't know what it is that
every person walked in this room with.

00:38:55.845 --> 00:38:57.615
But I do know that you
have an answer for it.

00:38:58.515 --> 00:38:59.655
You have an answer for it, Lord.

00:38:59.655 --> 00:39:03.405
It is your love grace and mercy that
you want to pour out on each other.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:08.910
Who boldly goes before you today during
this time of invitation and says, Lord, I

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:11.730
need you, Lord, help me overcome my sin.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.270
Help me turn from my wicked ways.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:19.410
Lord, help me overcome this
bitterness Lord, I so hard.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.860
So hardly believe Lord that in this
text, if we would've just saw Jonah

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.680
respond after verse four with Lord.

00:39:27.254 --> 00:39:27.734
How dare.

00:39:27.734 --> 00:39:31.154
I think this way, Lord help me
because I'm struggling, Lord.

00:39:31.154 --> 00:39:34.035
I believe that you would have wrapped him
in your arms and you would have walked

00:39:34.035 --> 00:39:39.225
with him through a pentance and helped him
take steps of faith towards celebrating

00:39:39.524 --> 00:39:42.254
that invites coming to faith in you, Lord.

00:39:42.254 --> 00:39:44.595
That's what you would do to
us today, Lord, that you're

00:39:44.595 --> 00:39:45.915
going to wrap us in your arms.

00:39:45.924 --> 00:39:49.274
When we come to you, struggling
to forgive someone, and you're

00:39:49.274 --> 00:39:50.805
going to say I'm with you.

00:39:51.225 --> 00:39:53.774
You're going to say I'm
going to help you through it.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.850
And that's the type of God you are.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:58.440
And I'm so thankful we serve you.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:01.830
So Lord, I pray for hearts to be
changed and lives to be changed today.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:03.930
Lord, if there's someone in this room
that doesn't know you, Lord, I pray

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:05.070
that they get up from their seat.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.260
During this time of invitation,
they come back and they talk and

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.700
they say, Hey Ben, I got questions.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:12.060
Hey Ben, I want to know Jesus, whatever
it is, Lord, I pray that they do it

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.910
today and they don't put it off Lord.

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:18.300
We know that you're the one that moves
and we're praying for you to move.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:20.940
So Lord, we just pray all
these things in your hands.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:22.520
Amen.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.240
Amen.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:24.420
Will you stand with me?

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:25.050
So we worship.
