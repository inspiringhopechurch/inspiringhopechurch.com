00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.780
So, I would say this.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.440
If some of y'all just show up a little
bit early, you'd get this before service,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.460
but Hey, just this not saying anything,
you know, just, just trying to help.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.130
Um, but, um, also I always encourage you
to do that after service as well, because

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.830
it's just a great way again, to connect.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.070
Don't just run out, um, connect
with those who, um, have been

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.540
obviously here at service.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.759
Uh, things like that as well.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.650
So, um, so last week we
took some time to remember.

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:36.269
So last week we took communion and we took
time to remember Jesus's example, right?

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.769
What did Jesus do for us run?

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.030
He died on the cross, right?

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.930
He died for our sins so that we can have
a relationship with him, be forgiven,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.550
um, and really spend eternity with him.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.360
But we were mimicking.

00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:48.195
What I would believe in the word.

00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:53.565
It says his most important example of
serving one, another serving one another.

00:00:53.565 --> 00:00:54.735
And so we were challenged not to.

00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:57.375
Remember what God did for us on the cross.

00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:01.754
But to remember the example, God set
for us to live in serving one another.

00:01:02.114 --> 00:01:05.414
So as I was preparing really for
communion coming up a couple of

00:01:05.414 --> 00:01:08.265
weeks ago, I started thinking, Hey,
we've got a couple of weeks before I

00:01:08.265 --> 00:01:09.585
can start doing a Christmas series.

00:01:09.975 --> 00:01:10.965
What should I preach on?

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:13.725
And God brought Exodus
16 in the next week.

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:18.315
We'll deal with the exit 17, where
there was a people that forgot.

00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:21.225
There was a people that
forgot to remember, and I

00:01:21.225 --> 00:01:22.005
thought this would be good.

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:26.654
We took time last week to remember what
happens when we forget to remember.

00:01:26.925 --> 00:01:30.565
Um, and I, I, as I began to seek the
Lord, we can begin to see in verse or in,

00:01:30.565 --> 00:01:35.115
in Exodus 16, where the people of Israel
forgot to remember what God had done for

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:37.095
them and begin to complain and grumble.

00:01:37.455 --> 00:01:40.695
And so we're going to be an exited
16 today, but before we get started,

00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:43.304
as you guys are turning there,
I wanted to start off this one.

00:01:43.304 --> 00:01:43.804
I think.

00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:47.445
I would say this the way in which
we, um, lead worship service,

00:01:47.445 --> 00:01:49.485
if you're ever wondering, Hey,
why do we sing these songs?

00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:51.915
What's the purpose behind
the words and everything.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:54.645
All of that is really an
opportunity to give praise to

00:01:54.645 --> 00:01:56.115
God for what he has done for us.

00:01:56.595 --> 00:01:59.975
Um, or we're affirming promises
that God has given us in.

00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:04.125
But I wanted to start off by asking, and
I'm going to try to get as many of you

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:09.315
to answer this statement, um, by sharing
one thing that God has done for you.

00:02:09.465 --> 00:02:12.855
One thing that God has done for you, where
you can say, Hey, God's done this for me.

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:15.795
And we can think of it in terms of just
what's the Bible say God's done for

00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:17.955
us, or it could be a practical example.

00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:20.985
Maybe God's met a
spiritual, um, relationship.

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:22.704
Or financial need for you.

00:02:22.704 --> 00:02:24.204
So what is one thing?

00:02:24.234 --> 00:02:26.815
And there may be a hundred things, but
what's one thing God's done for you.

00:02:26.815 --> 00:02:28.495
So just start popping them off.

00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:28.885
Let's go.

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:30.745
What's one thing God's
done for you, your wife.

00:02:30.774 --> 00:02:31.614
Hey, that's great.

00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:34.614
Are you pointing to her to answer both?

00:02:34.674 --> 00:02:36.805
Okay, now you're good.

00:02:37.465 --> 00:02:37.975
Who else?

00:02:39.394 --> 00:02:39.905
Family.

00:02:40.024 --> 00:02:40.595
Kids.

00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:41.095
Children.

00:02:41.105 --> 00:02:41.605
Okay.

00:02:43.465 --> 00:02:44.515
That's one thing that God's done.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.190
Yes, physical healing.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.850
That's great.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.480
What else?

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.250
Hoping everybody's got something, Joe.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.090
What's God done for you?

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.470
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.030
That's great.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.030
Couple more.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.180
Let's get it done for you, Laura.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.680
What's gotten done.

00:03:13.915 --> 00:03:14.605
A lot.

00:03:14.725 --> 00:03:15.174
Okay.

00:03:15.174 --> 00:03:16.584
Just all that.

00:03:17.394 --> 00:03:17.894
Okay.

00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:19.105
No, you're good.

00:03:19.135 --> 00:03:20.095
I'm just calling you out.

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:20.935
I'm just calling yet.

00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:25.015
So I'll stop doing that because you
guys are starting to get uncomfortable

00:03:25.015 --> 00:03:27.445
and you're wanting to see the quickest
route to the restroom right now.

00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:28.375
Cause you don't want to be called out.

00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:32.304
So let me share what God's done for me
and I kind of summarized it this way.

00:03:32.755 --> 00:03:35.274
Um, and, and kind of just,
I think it makes sense.

00:03:35.304 --> 00:03:35.875
God's provided.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.140
A friend to invite me to church
almost 12 years ago, 12 years ago,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.960
when I went to that church, God
provided a church to invest in me.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.030
Um, what I was at that church, grace
and forgiveness found me, um, when

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.610
I was at that church and as grace
and forgiveness family, and as

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.270
people invested in me, God gave me a
call and drew me into the ministry.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.860
Um, as God called me into the
ministry, he gave me Jesus to follow.

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:02.174
And provide for all of
my needs along the way.

00:04:02.714 --> 00:04:04.994
See, that's a summary of
what God's done for me.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:07.875
And there's, there's so many stories
and I'm going to share a couple more

00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:10.394
of those stories throughout this
message of what God has done for me.

00:04:11.174 --> 00:04:13.635
But each of us could probably sit here.

00:04:13.635 --> 00:04:17.625
And if we had time to really reflect
and list that all the things God's

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:20.925
done for us, we would be thrown a fit
and whatever you, by throwing a fit,

00:04:20.925 --> 00:04:22.995
like throwing a party of celebrating.

00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:28.565
Because God has done so much
for us, but I do recognize this.

00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:30.185
What if you're in the room
and maybe you're saying, Hey

00:04:30.185 --> 00:04:31.325
God, hasn't done that for me.

00:04:31.595 --> 00:04:34.355
My hope is by the end of today, as you
begin to see what God's done for the

00:04:34.355 --> 00:04:37.205
people of Israel, what God's done for
some of the stories that you'll hear

00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:41.165
from not only for me, but hopefully as
we begin to get to know one another and

00:04:41.165 --> 00:04:45.095
see what God's done, you guys will start
seeing that God's always been working and

00:04:45.095 --> 00:04:46.865
he will continue to work in your life.

00:04:47.735 --> 00:04:50.945
See, I think about this, what happens
when God gets home or whatever life.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.550
I mean, I know you guys know this right.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.330
Life gets hard.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.760
Um, sometimes our
marriages are struggling.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.410
Sometimes we are struggling because
of an unexpected financial bill.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.620
Sometimes we're struggling because
of relationships with family

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.010
members, nobody has issues with like
relational issues with family at all.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.510
Anybody.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.700
No, I'm, I'm maybe I'm
the only one in this.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.620
Um, but I think it's easy for us to
forget to remember when we have struggles.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.280
That God has done so much for us.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.870
And I just started thinking about this.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.240
When we think about, you know,
difficult lives or things being

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.810
difficult, Phillip Brooks said this,
he says, do not pray for easy lives.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.230
Pray to be stronger
men and stronger women.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.150
He says, do not pray for tasks
equal to the powers to your powers.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.930
Pray for powers equal to, to
the tasks that you have at hand.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.220
I've heard it this way.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.940
Don't tell God your problem.

00:05:45.705 --> 00:05:47.565
Tell your problems about your God.

00:05:48.675 --> 00:05:52.215
See many times in our lives,
whenever things get difficult, we

00:05:52.215 --> 00:05:54.825
forget all that God's done for us.

00:05:55.275 --> 00:06:00.375
And we begin to complain and we begin
to get frustrated and we begin to

00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:04.455
fall away from the life that God's
called us to one clean to him in

00:06:04.455 --> 00:06:08.985
those times, but to celebrate and
not forget what God has done for us.

00:06:09.315 --> 00:06:11.625
So the only way in which we can have
confidence in doing that is not.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.830
Um, not forgetting.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.370
And so as we explore the texts today
and exit a 16, we're going to see

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.660
a people where they did forgive.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.780
And, uh, we're going to learn from them.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.690
So I want to kind of just give a
brief background before we jump into

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.510
exit 16, because if we do, you'll be
like, what the heck just happened.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.789
So how many people in here are familiar
by raise of hands of the people, uh,

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.310
leaving Egypt and the red sea parting.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.450
Anybody heard that story?

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.140
The red seat party.

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.000
Good.
So we have a good general idea of that.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.219
So really this is what this
is coming off of people of

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:42.990
Israel cried out for 400 years.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.655
God said, Releases from Egypt, right?

00:06:46.655 --> 00:06:47.585
The slavery of Egypt.

00:06:47.585 --> 00:06:52.805
And so God heard them and they, he sent
Moses, Moses came, if you know the story,

00:06:52.805 --> 00:06:56.585
all these different plagues came and
finally Pharaoh says, you can leave.

00:06:56.614 --> 00:06:57.114
They have.

00:06:57.765 --> 00:07:01.395
The leave and Pharaoh decides to change
his mind and he chases after them.

00:07:01.425 --> 00:07:06.075
They get to this red sea and God
tells Moses to raise up his hands to

00:07:06.105 --> 00:07:07.785
part the waters and the waters part.

00:07:07.785 --> 00:07:08.655
And the people walk through.

00:07:08.655 --> 00:07:12.435
One of the things I love about this
story and the story of Joshua is when

00:07:12.435 --> 00:07:16.665
they cross the water, when the water is
parted, they walk through on dry ground.

00:07:17.205 --> 00:07:19.965
They don't just walk through on the
ground, which means it could be muddy.

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:22.185
They walked through on dry
ground, not only to God removed

00:07:22.185 --> 00:07:23.385
the water, but he dried up.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:24.990
So they could walk on it.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.900
So they walked across the, the
ocean or the red sea, excuse me.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.250
And as soon as they get across, all the
Egyptians are falling them in the ocean.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.210
Cause back down on them.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.780
There's red sea.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.020
Sorry.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.660
I keep saying that red sea comes back
down on them and they're destroyed.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.360
So Exodus 15 is, is really these people
spending the whole time celebrating

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.780
and giving praise to what God did
because it's easy when life's going.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.700
Good to praise God.

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:56.020
But quickly, we'll see here and exit a 16
and really at the back end of Exodus 15,

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.830
we see where the people begin to complain
and grumble because they didn't have any.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.039
And God said this.

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:05.010
I want to kind of just read a couple
verses in Exodus 15, and then we're going

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.020
to read part of 16 and jump in here.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.780
Um, he says this in Exodus 1522, it says
then Moses led Israel on from the red sea.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.900
And they went into the wilderness of
Sherm and they journey for three days

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.460
in the wilderness without finding water.

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:20.610
And they came tomorrow, but they
could not find water to drink

00:08:20.789 --> 00:08:21.990
at Mara because it was bitter.

00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:23.460
And that is why it was named.

00:08:24.075 --> 00:08:26.685
The people grumbled to Moses,
what are we going to drink?

00:08:26.955 --> 00:08:29.655
And so we cried out to the Lord and
the Lord showed him a tree and he threw

00:08:29.655 --> 00:08:33.215
it into the water and the water became
drinkable and the Lord made a statute

00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:35.235
and ordinance at Mara and he tested them.

00:08:35.235 --> 00:08:39.735
And he said, if you will carefully
obey the Lord, your God and do what is

00:08:39.735 --> 00:08:43.034
right in the sight and pay attention
to his commands and keep his statutes.

00:08:43.034 --> 00:08:44.805
I will not inflict any illness on you.

00:08:45.615 --> 00:08:48.885
And he says, like I inflicted on the
Egyptians and then we see in verse

00:08:48.885 --> 00:08:53.415
27 and they came to ELAM where they
were 12 Springs and 70 date palms.

00:08:53.655 --> 00:08:55.065
And they camp there by the water.

00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:56.175
So here's what we see.

00:08:56.175 --> 00:08:58.485
The people had just got done celebrating.

00:08:58.965 --> 00:09:01.575
They were out of water, they were
thirsty and they begin to complain

00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:04.425
and grumble, which sounds logical,
why we complain and grumble.

00:09:04.425 --> 00:09:07.455
But if after what God had
just done, they forgot.

00:09:08.189 --> 00:09:11.189
The guy could do it again by just
providing one or so they complained

00:09:11.189 --> 00:09:12.150
and Graebel well, what did I do?

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.470
He says, okay, one, I'm going to provide
a way to get clean water to I'm going to

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:17.939
kind of make a, an agreement with you.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.970
If you'll just follow me and trust me,
I'll take care of all of your needs.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.790
So I think of Matthew six, where
he says that if you'll seek first,

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.370
the kingdom of God, all these
things will be added to you.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.580
When we think about anything that we need
in life, our resources, God will provide

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.840
that as we seek first, the kingdom of God.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.470
So we made this agreement with them
and he even showed them a sign of it.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.180
Right?
Verse 27 is a sign of him.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.870
Date trees, basically food
and water right after.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.120
So if you're anything
like me, you see this.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.210
If you finished up
Exodus 15, you go great.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:45.780
They got it.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.410
But let's read, we're just gonna
read verses by verse and, and kind

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.000
of walk through this together.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.540
Um, and just see what we learn from them.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.220
So in verses one through three, in
chapter 16 of exitus assists this, then

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.730
the entire Israelite community departed
from Islam and came to the wilderness of

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.710
sin, which is between Islam and Sinai.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.880
And on the 15th day of the second month
after they had left the land of Egypt,

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.530
the entire Israelite community grumbled
against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.830
Do you think they learned now.

00:10:16.665 --> 00:10:18.165
Legitimate reason they're probably hungry.

00:10:18.165 --> 00:10:19.215
So what does it say in verse three?

00:10:19.395 --> 00:10:22.785
The Israelites said to them, if only we
had died by the Lord's hand in the land

00:10:22.785 --> 00:10:27.015
of Egypt, when we sat by pots of meat
and ate bread, when we wanted, instead,

00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:30.074
you brought us into this wilderness to
make the whole assembly die of hunger.

00:10:30.765 --> 00:10:33.585
So what happens, we're going
to learn from the Israelites.

00:10:33.615 --> 00:10:37.275
What happens when we forget to remember,
and here's what we're going to find today.

00:10:37.935 --> 00:10:40.035
However, they responded.

00:10:40.035 --> 00:10:41.295
We probably have responded before.

00:10:42.015 --> 00:10:45.435
So what happens when we forget to
remember what God has done for us?

00:10:45.435 --> 00:10:46.845
Number one, we grumble and complain.

00:10:47.115 --> 00:10:47.685
It's simple.

00:10:47.685 --> 00:10:48.945
The text clearly says that.

00:10:48.945 --> 00:10:51.525
So anybody here ever grumbled
and complained anybody?

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:55.305
So why do we typically, so
somebody give me some examples

00:10:55.305 --> 00:10:56.985
of why you grumble or complain.

00:10:57.675 --> 00:10:59.115
What's the reason why
you grumble or complain.

00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:03.785
Somebody wronged us.

00:11:03.785 --> 00:11:04.175
That's good.

00:11:04.175 --> 00:11:04.675
What else?

00:11:05.495 --> 00:11:06.785
Something didn't go my way.

00:11:06.905 --> 00:11:07.745
One more answer.

00:11:09.425 --> 00:11:10.235
Why do you grumble?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.510
Oh, wait, what?

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.400
You're hungry.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:17.680
Yes, I am.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.030
So Brittany is not in here.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.390
Yes.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.469
I would agree with you.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:21.099
That is me.

00:11:21.339 --> 00:11:21.839
Okay.

00:11:21.969 --> 00:11:28.150
So we grumble and complain because
something isn't comfortable, it's not

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.800
right with us, somebody wrongness it.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.040
So it's some kind of personal
obviously issue or problem with us.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.839
And again, we look at
this and they didn't have.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.740
Or water again, and
then we're complaining.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.600
And so it seems like a legitimate answer.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.120
And we're going to kind of walk
through that a little bit in a minute

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.990
for me, if you guys want to know, um,
I've typically grumble and complain

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.350
when we all go shopping six of us.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:50.720
Okay.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.350
And do you guys probably know why?

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.430
Because the kids don't listen.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.960
They want everything on the shelves
and then we're there for an hour and a

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.210
half nobody's else has had that issue.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:00.710
Have you?

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.830
Okay.
But I have, so I grew up with.

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:03.155
Right.

00:12:03.555 --> 00:12:04.845
Um, so it's not enjoyable.

00:12:04.845 --> 00:12:07.845
Let me share a story though, where
sometimes we'll find ourselves

00:12:07.845 --> 00:12:10.095
grumbling and complaining, even
in the middle of a blessing.

00:12:10.515 --> 00:12:14.655
So me and my family and something that
you're, you'll hear more about us.

00:12:14.655 --> 00:12:16.485
We have God's stories.

00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:16.985
It seems.

00:12:17.745 --> 00:12:21.015
Every week, something that God
is doing crazily in our lives.

00:12:21.015 --> 00:12:24.734
And so we've been in ministry for
the last nine, almost 10 years.

00:12:25.155 --> 00:12:29.204
And in that process, what I would
say about probably seven, eight

00:12:29.204 --> 00:12:31.245
years ago, we were a young family.

00:12:31.245 --> 00:12:32.564
So we didn't have all of our kids yet.

00:12:32.865 --> 00:12:35.204
We were young in ministry and we were.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.910
And I say poor is basically
we wanted to go on a vacation.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.080
So we just did a staycation.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:40.710
That was our goal.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.110
So we're going to do a
staycation and we had somebody.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.640
And again, this is one
of the blessings of God.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.320
We had somebody walk up to us one day.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.780
It was two days before we're going
to go on a vacation staycation

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.640
and the handwritten envelope.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.670
And when I got to my car open that
envelope and it was a thousand dollars

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.370
and I go, oh my gosh, what the heck?

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.000
And so what it said on the note was
go take your family on a vacation.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:05.100
So we planned quickly and
decided to do a trip to St.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.600
Fe.

00:13:06.479 --> 00:13:09.990
Um, I had found out on the Wednesday
morning that we were going to

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.699
leave that night, that I had strep.

00:13:12.449 --> 00:13:13.860
Uh, we were driving overnight.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.650
We got there at eight o'clock
in the morning because you drive

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:17.849
overnight when you have young kids.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.540
Um, and we got to the hotel, you
can't check the hotel til 2:00 PM.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.760
Um, but we go inside and they let us in
at 8:00 AM to get breakfast and get food.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.380
And now here's the only
way we can do this trip.

00:13:28.439 --> 00:13:30.089
One, we could only eat two meals.

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:32.954
I know you're thinking,
did we starve our kids?

00:13:33.015 --> 00:13:36.435
We gave them snacks for lunch,
but we ate at the hotel and

00:13:36.435 --> 00:13:37.665
we one mill in the evening.

00:13:37.665 --> 00:13:40.964
So the, the lunch was kind of just like,
we just kind of merge those together.

00:13:41.415 --> 00:13:42.645
Um, we couldn't do anything extra.

00:13:42.645 --> 00:13:43.665
We went to SeaWorld.

00:13:43.814 --> 00:13:44.535
We did go to SeaWorld.

00:13:44.535 --> 00:13:47.564
We couldn't do anything extra than that,
which again, blessed, but in the middle

00:13:47.564 --> 00:13:53.324
of that trip, I found myself grumbling
and complaining rather than focusing

00:13:53.324 --> 00:13:55.334
on the blessing that God had given us.

00:13:56.204 --> 00:13:58.395
And so I, I share that story
to say this it's either.

00:13:59.985 --> 00:14:05.565
I would say in our lives to, to forget,
because God's done so much for us.

00:14:05.565 --> 00:14:10.065
So, so let me just kind of step
out there when you have a bad day,

00:14:10.065 --> 00:14:12.375
because work didn't go your way.

00:14:13.125 --> 00:14:16.425
If you'll stop in that grumbling
and complaining and begin to

00:14:16.425 --> 00:14:20.775
list out all that God has allowed
you to do that day breathe.

00:14:21.885 --> 00:14:22.965
You may have a healthy family.

00:14:24.135 --> 00:14:25.155
You may get to go home to.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:26.610
That's beautiful.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:27.780
Two cars that work.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.760
And some of us, I know lately didn't work.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:30.290
Right.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.050
You're good now.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.490
So you've got a car that works great.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:37.050
So we can begin to list off
just the simple things, but

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:37.920
then we can go big things.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.990
Because for me, I lean on that day,
seven years ago of the thousand

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.840
dollars that was given to us, to
me, I'll list that out and I'll find

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.699
myself listing more and more and more.

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:51.959
And at the end of the day, that one day,
one day bad at work isn't bad anymore.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.060
Why?

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.270
Because I didn't forget to write.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.670
What God's done for me too many times,
we let the thing in front of us grab

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.380
a hold of our attention so much.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.020
We forget everything else around us.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.220
That is going good.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.280
So again, why didn't I complain as much?

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.740
Maybe I should've come should have
not complained as much, right.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.780
Is because I remembered the
blessing that God had given me.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.430
I know that life gets hard.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:14.610
Right?

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.030
We had the unexpected bill again,
lost jobs, sickness, family conflict,

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.390
and we get so sucked into focusing
on the problem rather than just.

00:15:22.469 --> 00:15:23.699
And that's exactly what Israel did.

00:15:23.699 --> 00:15:26.400
They got sucked into focusing
on the problem rather than God.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.920
And so when life gets
tough, we're number Nita.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.280
Remember, um, that he has done for
us and focusing on the blessing

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.599
rather than the difficulty.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.739
So what happens again?

00:15:34.739 --> 00:15:36.810
When we forget to remember right.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.819
We grumble and complain,
but what's the second thing.

00:15:39.525 --> 00:15:40.755
Well, let's look at what Israel did.

00:15:40.755 --> 00:15:43.905
The second thing that they did is
they question what God was doing, and

00:15:43.905 --> 00:15:46.365
I'm going to read verse three again,
and we're actually going to read up

00:15:46.365 --> 00:15:49.545
to 12 because I want to make sure
everybody hears this whole story.

00:15:49.965 --> 00:15:52.755
So we see verse three, again, it
says this, it says the Israelites

00:15:52.755 --> 00:15:58.349
said to them, if only we had died
in the Lords, uh, um, Died by the

00:15:58.349 --> 00:15:59.670
Lord's hand in the land of Egypt.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.030
When we sat by the pots of me and
ate all the bread we wanted, instead

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.689
you brought us into the wilderness to
make our whole assembly die of hunger.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.290
Then the Lord said to Moses, I'm going
to rain bread from heaven for you.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:10.910
What?

00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:11.910
Like number one.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:17.320
Um, to, um, it says the people
are to go out each day and

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.730
gather enough for that day.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.540
This way I will test them to see whether
or not they will follow my instruction.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.380
And on the sixth day, when they prepare
what they were, um, what they were

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.890
to bring in there to bring twice as
much as they gather on the other days.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.610
So Moses and Aaron said to the
Israelites this evening, you will

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.490
know it was the Lord who brought
you out to the land of Egypt.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:38.050
He's pointing them back to him.

00:16:39.015 --> 00:16:42.105
And in the morning, you will see the
glory Lord glory, because he heard

00:16:42.105 --> 00:16:45.825
your complaints about him for who
are we that you complained to us.

00:16:46.125 --> 00:16:47.055
And Moses continued.

00:16:47.055 --> 00:16:49.995
The Lord will give you meat to
eat this evening and bread that

00:16:49.995 --> 00:16:51.314
you want in the morning for.

00:16:51.314 --> 00:16:54.075
He has heard your complaints
and you are raising against him.

00:16:54.495 --> 00:16:55.814
Who are we?

00:16:55.845 --> 00:16:59.715
He says that twice you complaints,
your complaints are against us, but

00:16:59.745 --> 00:17:00.945
really they're against the Lord.

00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:05.145
Then Moses said to Aaron, say to the
whole entire Israelite community come

00:17:05.145 --> 00:17:06.555
before the Lord for, he has heard you.

00:17:07.575 --> 00:17:10.665
And as Aaron was speaking to the entire
Israelite community, they turn towards

00:17:10.665 --> 00:17:14.925
the wilderness and there in the cloud
was the Lord Lord's glory appeared.

00:17:15.375 --> 00:17:16.485
And the Lord spoke to Moses.

00:17:16.485 --> 00:17:17.955
I have heard your complaints of Israel.

00:17:18.135 --> 00:17:20.535
Tell them at Twilight, you
will eat meat in the morning.

00:17:20.535 --> 00:17:21.945
You will eat bread until you are full.

00:17:22.305 --> 00:17:24.525
And then you will know that
I am the Lord, your God.

00:17:25.215 --> 00:17:28.125
So as I looked at this, first of all,
we're seeing in verse three, that they

00:17:28.125 --> 00:17:29.505
are beginning to question the Lord.

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:31.335
Why did you take us out of Egypt?

00:17:31.695 --> 00:17:32.895
Why didn't you just kill us there?

00:17:32.895 --> 00:17:35.295
We had plenty of food
to remove a food to eat.

00:17:35.745 --> 00:17:36.525
I started thinking about this.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.400
The people of Israel sure.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.720
Remembered the full pots of meat,
but they had forgotten God partying

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.080
the water and destroying the enemy
that enslaved them for 400 years.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.600
So at times we question God, so what
I want us to talk about now is this,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.310
because I don't want us to miss this part.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.100
I think Joe mentioned this right?

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.420
When we get hungry.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.220
I mean, it's.

00:17:59.055 --> 00:18:02.265
And, and thinking for them several
days, I mean, it is difficult.

00:18:02.535 --> 00:18:05.655
It's hard to focus, so it makes sense
why they would be maybe grumbling

00:18:05.655 --> 00:18:07.155
complaining and things like that.

00:18:07.995 --> 00:18:09.675
So let me ask this question.

00:18:09.675 --> 00:18:13.755
How many of all in the last couple of
years, maybe just in your lifetime, how

00:18:13.755 --> 00:18:16.275
many of you have had a tragedy happen?

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:20.145
Bad days, doubt, fear,
or lost a loved one.

00:18:20.295 --> 00:18:20.985
Raise hands.

00:18:21.885 --> 00:18:22.385
Okay.

00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:26.055
So I'd say the majority of us, how
many of you all have experienced

00:18:26.055 --> 00:18:28.185
one or two of those things in
the last couple of years, right?

00:18:30.135 --> 00:18:30.405
Okay.

00:18:30.405 --> 00:18:33.915
And the last year, how many of y'all
at least experience one of those?

00:18:35.175 --> 00:18:35.675
Okay.

00:18:35.955 --> 00:18:42.285
So more and more you look at this, we
consistently go through trials strong.

00:18:42.315 --> 00:18:46.155
I mean, basically things that are
difficult to tragedies, they're hard.

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:49.815
And so I don't want to discount
that they're hard because obviously

00:18:49.815 --> 00:18:52.305
we see the people of Israel were,
were dealing with being hungry.

00:18:53.085 --> 00:18:54.875
But with when life is.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.890
It's easy to remember
God and maybe praise him.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.410
But when it's not, we begin
to question what God is doing.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.120
And that's exactly what the
people of Israel were doing.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.010
They just came off this major win.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:05.510
Right.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.110
But they didn't respond well.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.790
So one of the questions I want us to just
talk about for a minute, why do you think,

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.140
when you think about this text, why do you
think God allows these things to happen?

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.840
Why do you think God allowed
them to not have food and water?

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.920
What was the reasoning?

00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:29.449
What was he trying to do anybody
people to come to him, right.

00:19:29.449 --> 00:19:29.990
Rely on him.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:31.550
So they were, he was testing them.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.850
And if you even look at verse
four, he even talks about this.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.639
Then the Lord said to Moses, I'm going
to rain bread from heaven for you.

00:19:37.639 --> 00:19:39.470
And the people are going
to gather them each day.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:45.679
This way I will test them to see
if they will follow my instruction.

00:19:46.639 --> 00:19:47.929
See, whenever we think about our lives.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.290
Guys.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:53.729
I really want us to think about this
if we've said, okay, I've given my life

00:19:53.729 --> 00:19:58.169
to Jesus, which means this it's, it's
not, not only have I been forgiven of

00:19:58.169 --> 00:20:01.139
my sins and I get to spend eternity
with him, but I've given my life to him.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:09.300
What it means is that as we go, we go
to Jesus, we go to him in our times of

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.280
need and we shore to Pence upon him.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.909
That's what, that's, what it
means is what we should do.

00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:17.219
Right.
But again, it's easy when life is.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:22.050
We began to be so focused on our
situations that we forget the God that

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:26.400
saved us and the God that promised to
take care of us no matter what's going on.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.160
And that's exactly what
the people of Israel did.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.770
He, so he was testing them and
I thought this was interesting.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:32.460
He was testing him.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.210
Not because he didn't know their
hearts, he was testing them

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.500
because they didn't know their own.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.570
I guess I think it's so important.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.750
We're going to fail at times and
we're going to complain about.

00:20:44.185 --> 00:20:46.794
But this is the, the role of
the holy spirit, which means

00:20:46.794 --> 00:20:47.665
God living inside of us.

00:20:47.665 --> 00:20:52.254
It's the role of God's word is to convict
us and draw us back to a place of peace.

00:20:52.254 --> 00:20:55.735
During this time, it's a place of
comfort, a place of love, and to not

00:20:55.735 --> 00:20:58.254
spend our time away from the Lord in this.

00:20:58.975 --> 00:21:01.735
Um, and so the attitude we
take towards our difficulties

00:21:01.735 --> 00:21:02.875
determines the direction our life.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.780
And I've heard this statement said
so many times by Craig Rochelle,

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.030
your life has heading the direction
of your strongest thought.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.370
And I would totally agree with that
because the more that we think on

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.760
the issues, the struggles in our
lives, the more it will consume us.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.840
And we'll forget the God who is over that.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:19.830
We actually were.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.500
We met as a core team
as a church last night.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.040
And one of the things I taught
through was Exodus three and four.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.750
And it was Moses.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.730
When he finally said,
Lord, you can't use me.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.410
I'm not elegant in my.

00:21:32.475 --> 00:21:35.835
And here's what the Lord said
to Moses, Moses who made your

00:21:35.835 --> 00:21:38.655
mouth, who made people to speak?

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:39.855
Isn't it?

00:21:39.855 --> 00:21:40.725
I, the Lord.

00:21:41.505 --> 00:21:45.945
So in those moments, guys, when you're
looking at your issue or your struggle,

00:21:46.155 --> 00:21:48.945
I'm not neglecting that as though
it's not important because it is, it

00:21:48.945 --> 00:21:55.095
absolutely is, but God is in control
and over not only that situation, but

00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:56.595
being able to walk with you through it.

00:21:57.045 --> 00:21:58.335
So we'll quickly go to the.

00:21:59.159 --> 00:22:01.740
We'll understand that he
will help us through it.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.649
And every time we see the Lord, even
though they said, they complained

00:22:04.649 --> 00:22:08.010
to God, well, God continued to bless
them and provide, and he was trying

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:09.840
to remind them, Hey, don't forget.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.980
Don't forget.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.030
Don't forget.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:19.260
So how do we not forget God
in the middle of a struggle is

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.820
by not forgetting to remember.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.720
Right.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.639
And that's exactly what they forgot.

00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:25.189
They sure remember Egypt, but they didn't.

00:22:26.055 --> 00:22:26.745
What God had done.

00:22:26.805 --> 00:22:30.525
So what happens when we forget to remember
we grumble and complain, we question what

00:22:30.525 --> 00:22:35.715
God's doing, and then we see where we
try to take back control of our lives.

00:22:36.195 --> 00:22:37.515
So where do we see this in the text?

00:22:37.515 --> 00:22:41.145
And I'm going to read a little bit longer
block of text, but it's 13 through 30.

00:22:41.625 --> 00:22:42.825
This is where to see the people of Israel.

00:22:42.825 --> 00:22:46.185
So at the evening, the quail
came and covered the camp.

00:22:46.785 --> 00:22:49.335
And the morning there was a
layer of do all around the camp.

00:22:49.365 --> 00:22:53.355
And when the layer of do evaporated,
there was fine flakes on the desert

00:22:53.355 --> 00:22:54.915
surface, as fine as frost on the.

00:22:56.129 --> 00:22:59.100
And when the Israelites saw it, they
asked one another, what is this?

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.929
Because they didn't know what it was.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.879
And Moses told them it is bread.

00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:03.750
The Lord has given you.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.700
This is what the Lord has commanded
gather as much of it as each person needs.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.760
And you may take two courts per
individual, according to the number

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.890
of people, each of you has an iStent.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.450
So the Israelites did this, some gathered
a lot and some gathered a little.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.060
And when they measured it by
courts, the person who gathered

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.040
a lot had served, had no surplus.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.490
And the person who gathered a
little had no shortage and each

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:27.960
gathered as much as needed to eat.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.480
And Moses said to them, no one
has to let any of it remain until.

00:23:31.274 --> 00:23:33.105
But they didn't listen to Moses.

00:23:33.284 --> 00:23:37.185
Some people left part of it until the
morning and the bread grew worms and

00:23:37.185 --> 00:23:41.504
stank, and therefore Moses was angry with
him and they gathered it every morning in

00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:43.245
each gathered as much as needed to eat.

00:23:43.514 --> 00:23:44.745
But when the sun grew hot, it.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.930
And on the sixth day, they gathered
twice as much food for courts, a piece.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.570
And all the leaders in the community
came and reported this to Moses.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.790
And he told them, this is
what the Lord has said.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:58.620
Tomorrow is the day of complete rest,
a holy Sabbath to the Lord, bake what

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.950
you want to bake and boil what you
want to boil and set aside everything

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.450
left over and keep it until morning.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.410
And so they set it aside until morning
as Moses commanded and it didn't stink

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.450
or have magazine and eat it today.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:10.740
Moses said, because today's the.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.520
Uh, to the Lord today, you
won't find any in the field.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.930
And for six days you will gather it.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.080
But on the seventh day, the
Sabbath, there will be none yet.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.660
On the seventh day, some of
the people went out to gather,

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:23.130
but they did not find any.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.460
And then the Lord said to Moses,
how long will you refuse to keep

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.780
my commands and instructions?

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:28.830
And I'm just going to stop right there.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.390
We, when we forget what God has
done, what God has commanded,

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.320
what God has promised us.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.220
Just like the Israelites,
we neglect his commands.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.629
Don't take any more than you need.

00:24:39.639 --> 00:24:40.560
Take this certain amount.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.340
They took more.

00:24:41.639 --> 00:24:44.070
And those who took more
didn't have an abundance.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.520
And those who took just the right
number had enough will we'll don't

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.320
don't go look for any on the Sabbath.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.389
Um, cause it gives some
for the day before.

00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:52.050
So they, what did they do?

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.679
They took two portions the day before
my guess is that they ate at all and

00:24:55.679 --> 00:24:56.939
they went out looking forward again.

00:24:56.939 --> 00:25:00.120
And so what happens when we forget
to remember all the guests done?

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.880
We try to take back control of our lives.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:03.600
What did they do?

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.470
They were trying to hoard food
because they want to control of that.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.200
They tried to take things
into their own hands.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.570
Guys, I'll tell you this
out a personal example.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.880
There's times when life's going difficult.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.370
When I begin to get to the
Lord, maybe life's going good.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:19.230
And I don't even seek the.

00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:21.555
I don't even trust the Lord.

00:25:21.555 --> 00:25:22.845
I'm, I'm my savings accounts.

00:25:22.845 --> 00:25:23.565
Trying to get big.

00:25:23.595 --> 00:25:27.435
My, my I'm trying to just make
sure I got control of everything

00:25:27.435 --> 00:25:28.095
that's going on my life.

00:25:28.095 --> 00:25:30.435
And God reminds me quickly
that I'm not a control.

00:25:30.435 --> 00:25:30.935
He is.

00:25:31.365 --> 00:25:33.435
And that's what he was
showing Israelites in this.

00:25:33.735 --> 00:25:36.225
So they lacked faith that
God would provide food again.

00:25:36.855 --> 00:25:38.655
Um, they were trying to
take the place of God.

00:25:38.685 --> 00:25:39.185
Right.

00:25:39.524 --> 00:25:40.605
And I think that's challenging too.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.760
And so how often in our lives, I think
about this, how often in our lives,

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.389
when God blesses us and provides
for us, do we keep it all and act

00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:50.070
like God won't supply it anymore.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.810
I'll challenge you with this.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:55.290
God's word says it is more blessed
to give than it is to receive.

00:25:55.889 --> 00:26:00.330
I think too many times when we receive
a blessing, we forget that God gives

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:05.520
us that blessing, not just for us,
not to just be for us, but to give

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.830
through us, to give through us.

00:26:08.129 --> 00:26:08.629
And so.

00:26:09.315 --> 00:26:13.755
If you have a job every day, if you
get a bonus and Christmas every day,

00:26:13.875 --> 00:26:16.665
if you have clothes on your back and
you think, man, God's provided this

00:26:16.665 --> 00:26:18.555
for me, I must be a blessed person.

00:26:19.185 --> 00:26:21.405
I began to think God has blessed us.

00:26:21.405 --> 00:26:24.045
God has provided for us to
be a blessing to others.

00:26:24.495 --> 00:26:26.955
What a great season coming up
to be a blessing to others.

00:26:26.955 --> 00:26:29.625
And as a church we prioritize
at each month by serving our

00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:31.295
community and we'll do more of that.

00:26:32.385 --> 00:26:34.155
But I started thinking about
this is when we, when we

00:26:34.155 --> 00:26:35.685
wonder will God provide for us.

00:26:35.685 --> 00:26:38.355
If we give, if we give
will God provide for us.

00:26:38.355 --> 00:26:40.995
And I'll challenge you with this,
when you give financially here to the

00:26:40.995 --> 00:26:42.135
church, well, God provide for you.

00:26:42.165 --> 00:26:42.855
Absolutely.

00:26:43.125 --> 00:26:44.325
I've seen it personally in my life.

00:26:44.355 --> 00:26:46.485
The moment that we started giving
me everybody talked about this,

00:26:46.665 --> 00:26:49.275
the moment we started giving a
tide, which is 10% of our income.

00:26:50.085 --> 00:26:54.825
Somehow we had more money to live
on each month than we did the month

00:26:54.825 --> 00:26:57.165
before our math didn't work out.

00:26:58.095 --> 00:27:00.225
Meaning, like we'd said
it won't work, but it did.

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:00.555
Why?

00:27:00.555 --> 00:27:06.825
Because that's how God works because
tithing is a way to honor the Lord

00:27:07.035 --> 00:27:08.565
and be a part of God's kingdom work.

00:27:08.955 --> 00:27:10.005
So that's just a challenge to you.

00:27:10.005 --> 00:27:12.885
As I look into this, you know, when
we forget to remember that God has

00:27:12.885 --> 00:27:14.415
supplied everything we have, right?

00:27:14.415 --> 00:27:18.495
Our job, our breadth, our abilities, open
doors, money, health, we start acting

00:27:18.495 --> 00:27:20.835
like we have control and you know what?

00:27:20.835 --> 00:27:24.105
We have a responsibility to
steward that destroyed everything.

00:27:24.105 --> 00:27:24.975
Guys gives us.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.790
But God has promised to provide them
in Matthew 6 33, but seek first the

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.330
kingdom of God and his righteousness and
these things will be provided for you.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.500
So when we forget to remember, we start
trying to take back control of our lives

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.560
and only invite God in on the big things.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:46.560
We only invite God in on crisis mode,
but God wants us to be invited in him

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.480
to be invited in on every aspect of it.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.620
So when we forget to remember, we
complain and grumble, we question what

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.940
God is doing and we try to take back.

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:58.440
Here's what I believe the overarching
theme, the last statement you're

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.660
kind of want to know, are we, uh,
ending, heading towards the end when

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:09.120
we forget to remember, we miss out
on truly enjoying God's blessing.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.550
When we forget to remember, we miss out
on truly experiencing God's blessing

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.890
personally, I've experienced that.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.910
But I think even when we look at the
Israelites and when they begin to

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.490
complain and grumble, would they begin
to take their focus off of what God did.

00:28:24.555 --> 00:28:27.495
They forgot to celebrate
all the miracles guys.

00:28:27.825 --> 00:28:30.885
God gave them manna.

00:28:31.845 --> 00:28:37.635
God gave them basically bread and quilt
every single day to provide their needs.

00:28:38.175 --> 00:28:43.485
And they were so worried about, oh,
he may not do it tomorrow, but he was

00:28:43.485 --> 00:28:46.635
the same God that part of the waters
was the same God that provided water.

00:28:46.784 --> 00:28:49.095
It was the same God that's
providing food now, but he

00:28:49.095 --> 00:28:52.425
began to begin to forget for us.

00:28:53.355 --> 00:28:57.105
When we forget to remember, we missed
the blessing of experiencing God's

00:28:57.105 --> 00:29:00.075
Providence and in every year of our lives.

00:29:00.585 --> 00:29:04.095
And so if all we ever do is focus
on what we don't have, we'll never

00:29:04.095 --> 00:29:05.325
enjoy the blessings that we do.

00:29:06.525 --> 00:29:09.225
So although we see the people
of Israel, it seems like they

00:29:09.225 --> 00:29:10.305
have a legitimate complaint.

00:29:10.935 --> 00:29:11.895
Here's what I want you to see.

00:29:11.895 --> 00:29:13.635
God's perspective the Lord.

00:29:13.635 --> 00:29:17.565
Didn't because the Lord saw
people that chose to complain

00:29:17.565 --> 00:29:18.855
first, rather than trust the Lord.

00:29:20.939 --> 00:29:22.020
It's a challenge to us.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.689
If we truly believe that the Lord
has saved us, that he could save us.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:28.770
If he can save you from eternal damnation,
if he could save you from eternally

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:34.830
separated from God forever, if he can
save you for that, why, why can't he wait?

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:35.699
He can.

00:29:35.699 --> 00:29:36.959
So what, why do you not think?

00:29:36.959 --> 00:29:40.139
And I'm not just so you know, I'm
not like trying to be a jerk at this.

00:29:40.139 --> 00:29:42.330
I'm just really even saying
to myself, why can't.

00:29:43.305 --> 00:29:46.905
Sometimes trust the Lord for great
and mighty things to provide.

00:29:46.905 --> 00:29:48.945
Whenever I'm generous to provide.

00:29:48.945 --> 00:29:52.125
Whenever I feel like that the life's not
going right whenever there's a struggle in

00:29:52.125 --> 00:29:54.525
my marriage, whenever there's a struggle
on my family relationship or whatever,

00:29:54.525 --> 00:29:56.025
there's just a struggle in the world.

00:29:56.325 --> 00:30:02.325
Why can't I believe that my God, who
chose to send his son to die for my

00:30:02.325 --> 00:30:06.735
sins, can't choose to do anything he
wants to provide and meet the needs

00:30:06.735 --> 00:30:10.754
that I have and the needs that we
have around our community and around.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.649
I know this after today.

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:17.590
I want us to know my
God can, your God can.

00:30:18.429 --> 00:30:22.570
So whenever I think about this,
you know, my testimony ever, ever

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:26.409
since the last 12 years, I started
seeing God do some amazing things.

00:30:26.949 --> 00:30:30.879
Um, and I actually challenged, um, our
core team last night and this idea, and I

00:30:30.879 --> 00:30:32.110
want to challenge you with the same thing.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:36.429
If you want to experience God, move in
mighty ways, you need to put your yes.

00:30:36.429 --> 00:30:36.929
On the.

00:30:37.425 --> 00:30:39.285
You need to start attempting great things.

00:30:39.285 --> 00:30:41.865
You need to start
trusting God for miracles.

00:30:42.315 --> 00:30:45.045
When you start seeing God work in
your life, and it may be small,

00:30:45.075 --> 00:30:48.195
those small things become big
because you start seeing God work.

00:30:48.195 --> 00:30:51.945
But when we, when we take the control
out of God's hands, we will miss

00:30:52.305 --> 00:30:53.925
experiencing the joy of God's blessing.

00:30:54.555 --> 00:30:57.795
So I think about this over the last
12 years, we've seen God open doors.

00:30:57.795 --> 00:30:58.815
I thought he could never have.

00:30:59.895 --> 00:31:03.615
I've seen God provide
financially when we had needs.

00:31:03.615 --> 00:31:06.165
And so you guys know, I started
just recounting and I, I lost count

00:31:06.195 --> 00:31:08.445
around 30, 30 different times.

00:31:08.445 --> 00:31:13.304
In the last 12 years, we've either
had a financial concern hospital

00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:16.155
bills to, to needs to things.

00:31:16.155 --> 00:31:17.685
We didn't know how we
were going to do this.

00:31:17.715 --> 00:31:18.524
The next month.

00:31:18.764 --> 00:31:22.004
Financial needs 30 different times.

00:31:22.004 --> 00:31:24.725
God provided a way through.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.850
Through through just opportunities to
things of, of jobs, part-time jobs.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.460
I'm telling you every
time, how do I know that?

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.300
Because I reflected and I
remembered the man without

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.890
God, we wouldn't be here today.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:42.120
We, we, we sat here just so you guys
know is, you know, our full story.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.230
You may not know her full story.

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:46.260
We were heading here to
plant a church in 2019.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.860
Um, and we were at half the funding.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:54.420
We needed December 1st, 2019, and
we had already sold our house.

00:31:55.379 --> 00:31:57.689
Told everybody we're
leaving past assessment.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.939
We're moving, we're living
in temporary housing.

00:31:59.939 --> 00:32:03.989
We're moving in 30 days to come
to Cincinnati, to plant a church.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.459
We had half of our funding.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.229
What happened on December 30th.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.600
We had 1% of the funding we
needed to get here on the ground.

00:32:13.229 --> 00:32:15.899
Why it's not because we're special.

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:21.149
It's because we trust the God
who is, and that's one of many.

00:32:21.885 --> 00:32:23.955
Stories and it goes, it's
not all about finances.

00:32:23.955 --> 00:32:25.725
So, you know, we've seen
our daughter healed.

00:32:26.265 --> 00:32:30.195
We've seen families restored where
we're seeing some cool things

00:32:30.195 --> 00:32:31.305
happen with Brittany's family.

00:32:31.875 --> 00:32:34.605
Um, God is doing some amazing things.

00:32:34.605 --> 00:32:38.265
When you begin to trust him, when you
begin to put the control back in his hands

00:32:38.265 --> 00:32:42.165
and you begin to choose to celebrate and
experience the joy that he has for you.

00:32:43.845 --> 00:32:46.125
So why do I share all these things?

00:32:47.145 --> 00:32:50.895
Why, why do I believe, you know, three or
four weeks ago when I was praying about

00:32:50.895 --> 00:32:52.515
what we should, we should teach on today?

00:32:52.515 --> 00:32:54.165
Why did God bring up X to 16?

00:32:54.915 --> 00:32:57.405
I believe that God brought
up X to 16 because each one

00:32:57.405 --> 00:32:59.955
of us needed to hear this.

00:33:00.135 --> 00:33:03.465
If you say, Hey, I'm here because
I chose to be here this morning.

00:33:03.645 --> 00:33:07.095
I would say you're here because
God divinely appointed you to be

00:33:07.095 --> 00:33:09.285
here because there was something
in this message you need to hear.

00:33:09.285 --> 00:33:11.265
It's not about me and the
way in which I shared.

00:33:11.285 --> 00:33:15.195
It's the way God spoke to you in this.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.880
Are you forgetting to remember?

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:22.620
Do you forget on a daily basis, maybe
like I do at times, what do we do?

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.240
How do we overcome this?

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.690
We need to realize that how do we
not forget to remember so we can

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.520
experience God, move in amazing ways.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:36.150
We need to start placing
things in our lives.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.050
As reminders.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.490
I challenged our team this morning
as I'll challenge you guys today,

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.530
put sticky notes on your call.

00:33:44.385 --> 00:33:49.695
On your steering wheel so that every
time you get in, say, thank God for

00:33:49.695 --> 00:33:53.955
the blessing you experienced today
or in your life, put a sticky note or

00:33:53.955 --> 00:33:56.235
write it on your mirror with lipstick.

00:33:56.475 --> 00:33:56.865
Yes, man.

00:33:56.865 --> 00:33:57.975
You can use your wife's lipstick.

00:33:57.975 --> 00:33:59.475
I gave you approval it's okay.

00:34:00.615 --> 00:34:01.274
Right.

00:34:01.665 --> 00:34:04.004
God remember, remember right.

00:34:04.245 --> 00:34:05.445
Whatever you need to do.

00:34:05.445 --> 00:34:06.705
Why, why would we do.

00:34:07.695 --> 00:34:10.784
What we see in the Bible, we're
consistently in the old Testament, they

00:34:10.784 --> 00:34:17.625
would build altars or they would set
up stones as a remembrance, something

00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:21.554
to say, Hey, when we see this, we'll
remember all that God has done for us.

00:34:22.935 --> 00:34:27.585
It's these things that we place in our
lives to not forget to remember, you know

00:34:27.735 --> 00:34:31.725
what I think the number one thing that
we each one of us can do, if we'll have

00:34:31.725 --> 00:34:35.745
a personal daily relationship with the
Lord, if we'll spend time in the word.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:38.680
The Lord will remind you.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:39.610
He will.

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:41.110
So how do you do that?

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.050
If you, if you're not spending daily
time in the word, where do you start?

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:48.790
I want to be just encouraging to you
because I used to struggle with this.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:52.330
Even as a pastor, whenever I would say,
well, not as a pastor, but whenever I

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:56.620
was young in my faith, whenever I was on
staff at a church, I struggled with it.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.820
Well, why did it get in a routine?

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.220
And I found for me personally, the Bible.

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:04.155
The I use the YouVersion Bible
app, one of the easiest ways to

00:35:04.155 --> 00:35:07.935
stay in the word consistently
you get on there, it has plans.

00:35:07.935 --> 00:35:10.935
It has all the Bibles and
you can connect with friends.

00:35:10.935 --> 00:35:13.515
You can go through planes together,
you can hold each other accountable.

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:17.115
I'm always liking Kristen
and Joe's, uh, plans.

00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:20.175
They're doing some plans on the YouVersion
app and I sent him a text this week.

00:35:20.205 --> 00:35:25.935
I'm so excited to see you guys in the word
this week, and I hope it encourages them.

00:35:25.935 --> 00:35:26.175
Right.

00:35:26.175 --> 00:35:29.835
And, and it encourages me to get
in the word because when I did.

00:35:30.615 --> 00:35:34.904
I don't forget to remember to God is
challenging each of us, not to forget what

00:35:34.904 --> 00:35:36.855
he has done for us on the cross, right.

00:35:36.855 --> 00:35:42.915
To save us from our sins to give us new
life, to experience what I would say.

00:35:42.915 --> 00:35:44.595
We get to experience
God, this side of heaven.

00:35:44.595 --> 00:35:50.234
I think too many Christians give their
lives to Jesus and forget that God has

00:35:50.234 --> 00:35:52.185
given them the ability to celebrate now.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.890
Uh, the life God's called them
to live in a blessing experience.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.470
Relationship with Jesus
before you get to eternity.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.040
Yes.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.610
I'm looking forward to having one
day, but I want you to celebrate

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:03.600
and enjoy the relationship.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:04.130
God gives you.

00:36:05.085 --> 00:36:06.735
He has called us to live in that now.

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:11.715
So as we move to a time of imitation,
um, I always share, I don't ever

00:36:11.715 --> 00:36:15.855
want to assume what is the purpose of
invitation I want to share clearly, what

00:36:15.855 --> 00:36:18.975
is imitation invitation is two things.

00:36:19.125 --> 00:36:22.635
One is, it's a time
for you to reflect God.

00:36:22.905 --> 00:36:26.775
What did you speak to me about
in the middle of this message?

00:36:26.805 --> 00:36:27.975
Maybe through the worship service?

00:36:28.155 --> 00:36:29.775
What are you speaking to me?

00:36:30.315 --> 00:36:32.705
Lord?
How do I respond to this?

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.300
And so one of the things that we've
done in our worship set at the

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.970
end of service is we want to give
time for you to consider that and

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.230
walk through that too many times.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.509
We'll catch ourselves leading
straight into worship and you

00:36:42.509 --> 00:36:43.680
feel like, well, do I worship?

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:44.520
Do I stand?

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.000
What do I do?

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.290
We want you to, whenever the music starts,
there's gonna be no singing for you to

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:50.880
just bow your head wherever you are.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.940
If you want to get down on your knees,
whatever you are comfortable with and

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:58.310
begin to seek the Lord about what he is
asking you to take away from today's.

00:36:59.415 --> 00:37:00.674
Consider what God has done.

00:37:00.705 --> 00:37:01.694
That's part of invitation.

00:37:01.694 --> 00:37:03.044
Here's the other side of invitation.

00:37:03.375 --> 00:37:06.314
When you hear the word invitation, that
means inviting to do something wrong.

00:37:06.334 --> 00:37:09.404
We're inviting you to consider what the
Lord taught you, but we're also inviting

00:37:09.404 --> 00:37:13.365
you this, if you've never given your
life to Jesus, if you have questions

00:37:13.365 --> 00:37:17.504
about what does it mean to follow Jesus,
that's an invitation for you to seek.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.860
Well, you don't have to do that alone.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.230
And that's why you see every week,
I'll say, Hey, I'm gonna stay in

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.660
the back because I don't want you to
feel embarrassed to walk up front.

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:27.330
I want you to be able to come
back and say, Hey, I got questions

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.120
and we may not answer all of them
back there, but we can begin the

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.040
conversation of what it is to know.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.020
Jesus, maybe for you.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.880
You're asking this question,
what is my next step?

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.840
I'm a believer.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.800
Maybe it's baptism.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.070
Maybe you're a believer and
you're baptized, but you want

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:42.060
to get involved in the church.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:43.770
Maybe you want to ask that question.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.660
That's part of invitation as well.

00:37:46.484 --> 00:37:49.694
So after you take time to consider
what the Lord has taught you, as you

00:37:49.694 --> 00:37:53.475
take time to come back and talk with
me, our team will also lead you in an

00:37:53.475 --> 00:37:56.805
opportunity to worship and what I would
say on the way out to give God praise

00:37:57.314 --> 00:37:59.595
for what he's done in your life as well.

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:02.174
So I'm going to pray
and then we'll do that.

00:38:02.174 --> 00:38:03.524
So Lord Jesus, thank you.

00:38:04.365 --> 00:38:07.935
Because your word is truth
that we see Lord today.

00:38:08.024 --> 00:38:12.165
I'm an example of a people and Israel
Lord, where they forgot to remember.

00:38:12.375 --> 00:38:14.714
But Lord, I think the more
that we look at their stories.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.770
We can replace the Israelites with us
because we catch ourselves forgetting

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:24.930
to remember that even though life gets
difficult, that you're always present,

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:33.960
even though life is tough that you are
one prayer away from meeting our spiritual

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.430
Nene, our personal need to give us peace
and confidence in the midst of a storm.

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:44.250
God, I just pray that, that everyone
in this room, Lord, including myself.

00:38:45.975 --> 00:38:50.235
That we take time during this
invitation to just say, Lord, speak

00:38:51.705 --> 00:38:55.485
to just take time to say, Lord, what
is it that you want to teach me that

00:38:55.485 --> 00:38:57.105
you want me to apply to my life?

00:38:58.395 --> 00:39:00.975
Lord, I pray that each one of us
Lord leaves out of here with the

00:39:00.975 --> 00:39:05.435
plan in mind to put things in place,
to not forget, to remember all that

00:39:05.445 --> 00:39:06.705
they, that you've done for them.

00:39:08.115 --> 00:39:13.515
Lord, I also just pray that today there's
someone in this room that doesn't know.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.000
Someone that wants and desires to take a
next step, but they don't know what that

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.870
is, that they will come back to the back
and they'll say, Hey, I've got a question.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.750
Help me know Jesus, or
help me know my next step.

00:39:24.779 --> 00:39:27.600
And Lord, I just pray that you give me
the wisdom to be able to walk with them

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:32.279
in that, or give them the faith to do
it because Lord only you can do that.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.240
We thank you for this time and we
just pray this in your headline name.

00:39:36.509 --> 00:39:37.009
Amen.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.730
Amen.
