00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
(soft music)


00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:14.200
- Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord,


00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.360
and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart


00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.200
and with all thy soul and with all thy might.


00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.240
And these words which I command thee this day


00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.320
shall be in thine heart,


00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.200
And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children,


00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.920
and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house,


00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.720
and when thou walkest by the way,


00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.200
and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.


00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.280
And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand,


00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.560
and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.


00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.440
And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house,


00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.680
and on thy gates.


00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.260
(gentle music)


00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:04.760
- Well, this is the time where we start up


00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.760
and we get to dive into God's word,


00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.300
which is always exciting.


00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.200
It's also exciting coming out of a time


00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.720
just to be able to connect in between service.


00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.320
I think of so many times of how valuable it is


00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.160
just to, once everybody gets here,


00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.600
'cause we know this, I mean you got some of y'all


00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.420
that are the early crew, some of you the mid crew,


00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.200
some of you the late crew, and some of you the,


00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.580
you're still not here yet, they're coming.


00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.340
And I say that to say, reason why we take this


00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.740
five minutes in between is 'cause typically


00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.980
everybody's gotten here by now,


00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.240
and it's an opportunity to just kinda catch up


00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.460
and connect in between the kids transitioning out


00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.180
and us jumping into the word of God.


00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.660
So, hope you enjoyed that time as well.


00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.880
And so today we're gonna be in Acts chapter two,


00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.080
and we're gonna be in verse 37.


00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.400
This should be familiar to those


00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.080
who have been around Inspiring Hope


00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.860
'cause we talked about this text back in the fall,


00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.860
but we are currently in the middle of a series


00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.040
called Practical Evangelism, Practical Evangelism,


00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.800
and the reason why was,


00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.180
as we began to talk about our church


00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.240
and kind of where we were at as a church,


00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.880
one of the things as a church plant,


00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.000
or a new church, or a new church in a new space,


00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.680
is the importance of inviting people to church,


00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.400
the importance of inviting people


00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.680
into a relationship with Jesus.


00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.440
And so when I began to think about that,


00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.720
I remembered whenever I gave my life to Christ


00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.780
and whenever I was a part of a church,


00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.720
I was very, very intimidated by sharing my faith.


00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.360
And so I asked that question last week.


00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.720
I said, "Hey, how many people in this room


00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.780
"struggle to share your faith?"


00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.980
And I would say the majority of you


00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.140
that are willing to participate when I asked that question,


00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.240
raised your hand, because the majority of us


00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.600
do struggle with sharing our faith.


00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.700
And then I asked the question, "Why?


00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.340
Why do you struggle with sharing your faith?


00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.220
And some of those were, you don't know what to say,


00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.100
or you're afraid of people's responses when you do share.


00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.120
You're afraid of the questions that they're gonna ask


00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.380
that you will not be able to answer them.


00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.400
And then sometimes, and I get this,


00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.700
if you're used to thinking, again, with the church,


00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.820
that's the pastor's job, or that's the church's job


00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.420
to reach people and evangelize people.


00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.140
My job's just to come and be a part of church.


00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.580
So there's multiple reasons why we don't share our faith,


00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.780
But I totally get it, and that's one of the things


00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.220
and the reasons why we're in this series


00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.220
is practical evangelism is something


00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.860
that is near and dear to my heart


00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.120
because I used to, whenever I was new in my faith,


00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.340
complicate what it meant to share my faith,


00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.780
and which meant I shared it less and I shared it awkwardly.


00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.800
And because of that, I thought it would be important


00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.660
for us as a church, if I'm not the only one


00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.260
that has that struggle, then it would be important


00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.060
for us to walk through this together


00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.940
and see how we can practically evangelize.


00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.100
And so last week we started with a couple of questions


00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.440
that we answered, number one, why do we share our faith?


00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.900
Why do we share our faith?


00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.280
And so I listed four reasons why we share our faith,


00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.500
and here's the reason why.


00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.340
You won't do something unless you believe in


00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.740
why you should do something.


00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.120
Does that make sense?


00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.180
I mean, if you don't know why you're doing something,


00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.400
you're typically not gonna do it.


00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.700
So why do we share our faith?


00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.360
So number one, is this what God calls us


00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.200
as followers of Jesus?


00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.780
So if you've given your life to Jesus,


00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.580
it's what God has called us to do.


00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.060
And I would say this, we quoted a scripture last week,


00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.280
how will they hear unless someone tells them?


00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.240
So as a follower of Christ, somebody's gotta tell them.


00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.540
Number two, it would be the natural outflow.


00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.840
So why do we share our faith?


00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.160
It's because it's the natural outflow


00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.880
of our relationship with Jesus.


00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.040
And I would say this, is that the more time


00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.440
that you spend with Jesus, that Jesus will stick out.


00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.320
He will come out of your life.


00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.420
And so it would be a natural outflow.


00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.880
Number three, the reason why we share our faith,


00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.300
is 'cause we understand the consequences


00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.660
of someone not coming to faith in Christ,


00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.980
that they'll be separated from God for eternity, right?


00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.260
So I would call that conviction, right?


00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.660
So that's one of the reasons why.


00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.060
And the last one is desire.


00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.460
So we desire to see people


00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.580
to experience the same saving faith relationship


00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.740
that we have experienced with others.


00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.780
And I call that inspiration.


00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.020
And the reason why I call that inspiration


00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.660
is you have experienced God's love, mercy,


00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.360
and grace, and peace, and hope, forgiveness, you name it.


00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.920
You've experienced it all,


00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.520
and you desire for others to experience it.


00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.800
So why do we share our faith?


00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.080
Why do we evangelize?


00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.720
Those are some of the reasons that we shared last week.


00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.880
But then I also shared, I said,


00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.600
hey, what is practical evangelism?


00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.840
What does that mean?


00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.760
So when we think about the word practical,


00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.040
practical is a plan or method that is likely to succeed


00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.720
or be effective in real life.


00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.240
And you guys know this.


00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.940
You ever been in a classroom setting


00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.160
where somebody shares something


00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.500
that doesn't even relate to your life at all?


00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.980
I've been there, and it's the same way I've been there also


00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.220
when it comes to evangelism.


00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.600
It just doesn't correlate.


00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.220
It doesn't make sense to me.


00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.060
So the goal with practical evangelism is to be able to


00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.900
share how we can practically, real world life,


00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.820
share our faith with others.


00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.100
And so last week we got to look at how Jesus shared


00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.620
his faith, or how he shared the gospel,


00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.300
how he shared who he was.


00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.820
And one of the things we learned about Jesus,


00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.380
and I thought this was so cool,


00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.820
So Jesus took time to spend time with his Father,


00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.420
relationship with God, before he went out


00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.700
and consistently served in ministry,


00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.080
and did ministry, and to share the gospel.


00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.200
When we think about us,


00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.160
that's what we talked about last week,


00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.100
is we need to consistently spend time with Jesus


00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.360
so that when we go out to share our faith


00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.740
that we have something to give,


00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.980
we have encouragement from Jesus.


00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.620
And so my goal of last week was to say this,


00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.440
the key to simple faith sharing, right,


00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.780
or practical evangelism is a daily relationship with Jesus.


00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.620
And that may sound logical to you,


00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.440
but maybe it doesn't make sense,


00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.820
and I wanted to be able to give this example.


00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.900
Anybody ever fasted for a day?


00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.980
Anybody?


00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.880
Okay, a couple people.


00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.000
Some of you are like, never gonna do that,


00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.220
'cause I don't have to.


00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.980
So if you fast for a day, typically,


00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.300
you may lose a little bit of energy,


00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.840
and it's a little bit difficult to do,


00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.140
but you're like, hey, that's okay.


00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.940
But anybody ever fasted for a week?


00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.500
Right, most of us don't typically do that.


00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.840
Well, after about a week of fasting,


00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.460
your energy level and your ability to do your daily tasks


00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.460
become more complicated and less desirable.


00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.500
Does that make sense?


00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.020
So, let me just kind of extend this


00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.180
to your relationship with Jesus.


00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.020
If you don't spend time with Jesus daily


00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.820
in a relationship with him, getting to know him,


00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.820
and him getting to know you,


00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.980
then the more and more times


00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.320
that you don't spend time with Jesus,


00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.480
the less likely you are to share your faith with others.


00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.000
There's less desire, there's less motivation,


00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.440
there's less energy.


00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.760
You don't even recognize it or even know


00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.760
that you need to share your faith


00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.240
because you spend less time with him.


00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.180
So whenever I made that statement last week,


00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.840
so important that following Jesus is the first step


00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.640
to ever get to the point of practically evangelizing,


00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.620
which means the more time we spend with Jesus,


00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.820
the more likely we are to share our faith.


00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.800
So then we dove in and we saw how Jesus did it,


00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.920
and I'm just gonna break this down real quick.


00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.800
Jesus, with the woman at the well,


00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.080
there was a couple things that stuck out so well


00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.900
and I think it related to so many of us


00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.840
and I got some positive feedback from this.


00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.480
Number one, when Jesus shared with this woman at the well,


00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.180
he was tired and we can all relate,


00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.440
when it comes to evangelism,


00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.360
there's always an excuse to not share.


00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.440
And Jesus had the greatest one, being tired,


00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.640
because when we're tired, we don't wanna do anything


00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.680
but sleep or take care of ourselves.


00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.740
And Jesus didn't let that stop him from sharing.


00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.000
Then he did something out of the norm,


00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.440
which means this, he crossed cultural boundaries.


00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.280
He went and talked to a Samaritan woman as a Jew,


00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.920
and then it caused the woman to ask the questions


00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.080
because of him crossing those cultural boundaries.


00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.340
Then Jesus began to point to something greater


00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.960
until she realized that it was something that she needed.


00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.180
And here's what I loved, 'cause we transitioned quickly


00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.520
and we saw the woman's response to who Jesus was,


00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.960
and it was simple.


00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.920
After she realized who Jesus was,


00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.520
she took what she had heard,


00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.780
and she shared it with those she knew.


00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.500
She shared it with those she knew,


00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.600
and many of those people came to faith in Christ.


00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.580
So when we think about last week,


00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.020
we were really focusing in on our relationship with Jesus


00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:14.020
will drive us to share our faith with others.


00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.920
But then also we saw those two examples,


00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.320
and we even saw the simple example of the woman at the well


00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.840
simply sharing her faith, what she knew.


00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.220
She didn't worry about if she knew everything,


00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.360
and she was able to lead people to faith in Christ.


00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.620
So today, we're going to talk about the importance


00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.760
of living in community and how that affects our ability


00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.120
to practically evangelize.


00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.340
And you'll see me kind of take these two things


00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.340
and trade them out, either practically evangelize


00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.780
or simply share our faith,


00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.820
because that's basically what we're talking about here.


00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.980
So how community, living in community,


00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.660
affects our ability to share our faith.


00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.540
And I wanna kind of set up today's text,


00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.740
but before I do that, I wanna share with you guys


00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.740
the reason why, to me, this is such an important message.


00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.940
because it's something that I have experienced.


00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.980
So before I moved here to Ohio,


00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.420
I was part of a church where we started


00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.380
multiple small groups,


00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.380
where we lived in community with each other.


00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.440
And one of them sticks out the most to me.


00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.380
We left a small group to start this other small group.


00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.300
And this other small group that we were a part of,


00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.220
we helped build it up to about 30 people


00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.780
meeting in a classroom, 30 people.


00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.340
And this was a packed classroom.


00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.020
We loved each other.


00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.220
We saw God do some cool things in that group.


00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.960
but we knew there was somebody waiting on us


00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.460
to go start another group.


00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.220
And so we asked the group, we got in this group


00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.260
and we said, "Hey, who will go with us to start this group?"


00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.780
And nobody raised their hand,


00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.100
because everybody loved the group that they were in.


00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.940
And we're like, "Okay, what are we gonna do?"


00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.500
So I started just processing through


00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.320
who I saw some leadership tendencies in,


00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.660
and there was one couple that attended occasionally


00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.620
to this group.


00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.800
So we met with him and we said,


00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.100
"Hey, you think you're crazy enough


00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.320
"to maybe go start a group with us?


00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.640
"Like, you've got some previous experience


00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.980
from another church teaching a class,


00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.840
like we'll teach it, you come be a part of it.


00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.240
They're like, sure, why not?


00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.780
So four people go into a classroom to start a group.


00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.520
And the first week we had six people in that group.


00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.580
And we kept inviting people and inviting people


00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.760
and reaching out to people and inviting people.


00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.300
And over time we grew that group to about 20 people.


00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.040
But here was the cool part.


00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.080
As we begin to live in community with these people,


00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.960
we led four of those people to faith in Christ.


00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.280
I got to baptize all four of them.


00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.800
And I started thinking back through this.


00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.400
I see how living in community affected our ability


00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.920
to practically evangelize.


00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.640
'Cause the community that I was in,


00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.200
that was packed and full,


00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.720
had all given their lives to Christ.


00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.560
And if we would've stayed there,


00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.400
it still would've been good,


00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.920
there would've been some good things happening.


00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.620
But our ability to go out and create community,


00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.880
a new one that stretched us,


00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.980
actually led us to lead people to faith in Christ.


00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.800
And we were able to start two more groups after that


00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.200
and see God do some amazing things.


00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.080
I believe that community,


00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.480
living in community together, affects that.


00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.760
And the reason why we're gonna dive into Acts chapter two,


00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.520
even though we've talked about it recently,


00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.760
is because you're gonna see something beautiful,


00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.040
how living in community challenges us to share our faith,


00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.320
prepares us to share our faith,


00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.880
and gives us opportunity to share our faith.


00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.860
So to kind of set this text up, Acts chapter two,


00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.080
the books before this, if you're not familiar with this,


00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.800
the New Testament starts with Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.


00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.560
They are the four gospels.


00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.800
The reason why they're the four gospels


00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.360
is they talk about the life of Jesus,


00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.360
is birth, life, death, and resurrection.


00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.200
And so all of this has just got done happening, right?


00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.080
Jesus dies on the cross, he's put in the tomb,


00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.400
three days later he's alive.


00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.340
Hey, Easter's coming up in a month.


00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.000
Make sure you plan to be here and invite somebody,


00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.680
just so you know, since we're kind of already


00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.520
on that subject.


00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:40.340
But when Jesus is resurrected from his death


00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.040
and to begin to live, he lives on earth for 40 days


00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.800
and he begins to share some things


00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.760
and some lasting encouragement.


00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.160
And one of the last encouragements


00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.800
he gives to his disciples is this in Matthew 28, 19 and 20.


00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.960
He says, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations,


00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.740
"baptizing them in the name of the Father,


00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.260
"the Son, and the Holy Spirit,


00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.940
"and teaching them to observe everything I commanded you.


00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.360
"And remember, I'm with you always to the end of the age."


00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.860
So this is his, you know, you call it the Great Commission


00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.980
that he gives to these disciples.


00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.960
But then Acts 1 starts.


00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.420
And see, the writer of Luke, the gospel,


00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.280
is also the writer of Acts.


00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.200
And the story kind of continues as well.


00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.300
And so in the first part of Acts, in Acts chapter one,


00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.200
Jesus tells his disciples to wait in Jerusalem


00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.720
for the Father's promise, which is the Holy Spirit.


00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.200
And then he says, as they waited,


00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.480
God came to them and brought the Holy Spirit.


00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.640
And the Holy Spirit came on them,


00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.400
and they began to proclaim the message


00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.400
of the gospel boldly, right?


00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.680
And I want you to see this, the Spirit of God


00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.680
and the ability to proclaim the gospel boldly is connected.


00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.800
And there's a reason why we're talking about this


00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.120
before we dive into the text.


00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.220
The reason that they could boldly share the gospel


00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.920
was because the Holy Spirit had came into their lives


00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.820
and that is what gave them the ability and power


00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.920
to share the gospel.


00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.200
We can't miss this.


00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.480
So we see that God used broken men who had issues,


00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.460
who had failed Jesus before,


00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.920
and God still gave them the power of the Holy Spirit


00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.160
to proclaim the message.


00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.300
And what we're gonna see in this text as we read


00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.760
is 3,000 people gave their lives to Christ,


00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.360
and we're gonna focus in on what I call the revival


00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.820
that happened next.


00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.560
So let's jump into this text.


00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.400
In Acts chapter two, starting in verse 37,


00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.240
this is what it says.


00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.160
It says, "When they heard this," speaking of the gospel


00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.820
that was shared by the disciples,


00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.000
"they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter


00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.660
"and the rest of the apostles,


00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.640
"brothers, what should we do?


00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.860
"And Peter replied, repent and be baptized,


00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.060
"each of you in the name of Jesus Christ


00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.000
"for the forgiveness of your sins,


00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.500
"and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit,


00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.700
"for the promise is for you and for your children


00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.200
"and all who are far off,


00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.620
"as many as the Lord our God will call."


00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.180
And with many other words, he testified strongly


00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.340
and urged them, saying,


00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.100
"Be safe from this corrupt generation."


00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.860
So those who accepted the message were baptized that day.


00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.780
About 3,000 people were added to them.


00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.860
So this is at the end of that story.


00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.920
Now we're gonna see what their response was.


00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.680
So then it says, "They devoted themselves,"


00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.200
this group of 3,000,


00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.700
"They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching,


00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.100
"to the fellowship, to the breaking of the bread,


00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.180
"and to prayer.


00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.800
"And everyone was filled with awe,


00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.500
"and many wonders and signs were being performed


00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.820
"through the apostles.


00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.460
"And now all the believers were together


00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.160
"and held all things in common.


00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.320
"And they sold their possessions and property


00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.060
"and distributed the proceeds to all who had need.


00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.780
"And every day they devoted themselves


00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.500
"to meeting together in the temple.


00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.080
"They broke bread from house to house,


00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.620
"they ate food with joy, and they with sincere hearts,


00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.360
"praising God and enjoying the favor of all people.


00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.580
"Every day the Lord added to their number


00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.560
"those who were being saved."


00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.200
So let's pray, Lord Jesus,


00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.240
we know that your word is powerful,


00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.920
and we know that you are the one that works


00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.440
in the hearts of all your people,


00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.120
and I pray that you move in the lives


00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.260
of each person in this room, including myself,


00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.040
to continue to know you more.


00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.120
and we just pray this in your heavenly name, amen.


00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.640
So there's two things I want us to see in this text


00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.520
that we can learn.


00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.380
The first one is living in community encourages


00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.320
and prepares us to practically share our faith.


00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.520
And number two, living in community gives us opportunities


00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.280
to practically share our faith.


00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.880
So let's start with the first one, right?


00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.960
These 3,000 people right after being saved,


00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.000
after they begin to follow Jesus,


00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.520
they prioritized living in community.


00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.600
See, I look at the Word of God,


00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.840
and this is so you guys understand this.


00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.440
Sometimes we look at the word of God and we're reading it


00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.600
and we begin to not understand everything about it,


00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.920
but I look at the word of God and I say,


00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.800
"What did they have that I don't have?


00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.440
"What did they have that they're doing


00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.200
"that they saw God move that I could start being a part of


00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.920
"to see God move in my life?"


00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.960
And so I see this and I see immediately


00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.640
after they begin following Jesus,


00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.040
they prioritize living in community.


00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.440
I think that's really cool


00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.120
and I think that's something we should not miss in this.


00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.520
This is just a great example to see they prioritize this.


00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.040
And the writer Luke even used some strong language here.


00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.880
He says they devoted themselves.


00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.440
What's the word devoted mean?


00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.040
A strong dedication or affection for.


00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.120
Right, a strong dedication or affection for.


00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.400
And so one of the things that encourages me with this,


00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.720
and this is why I think it's important we see this,


00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.680
Paul didn't say, okay, after you give your lives to Jesus,


00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.200
you must do X, Y, and Z.


00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.080
Because that's legalism.


00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.460
Legalism says you do these three things and you're spiritual.


00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.040
What Peter did was he shared the gospel,


00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.960
they responded, and the natural outflow of their life


00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.720
was to devote themselves to these things.


00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.940
And I want you to hear this because I think at times,


00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.820
and I wanna kinda step here for just a minute,


00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.340
do you ever feel like when you come to church,


00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.580
it's because you have to?


00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.420
Anybody?


00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.440
Nobody's gonna admit it?


00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.360
'Cause maybe you're here right now.


00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.280
Hey, there we go, that's okay, that's good, thank you.


00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.400
I appreciate that.


00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.280
You've come to church because you have to.


00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.860
You serve in a ministry right now because you have to.


00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.260
You give because, well, that's what I have to do.


00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.220
I mean, if you start viewing your relationship with Jesus


00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.640
as a have to so that I can please God,


00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.280
or a have to so I can please others that are around me,


00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.360
we've missed the point of what God has called us to do.


00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.560
And so I want you to see this,


00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.940
and I think we cannot miss this,


00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:36.100
The natural outflow of following Jesus is these things


00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.440
as we dive into them, right, as we dive into them.


00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.400
And so we look at this and we see the first one.


00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.560
He says, "They devoted themselves


00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.360
"to the apostles' teaching."


00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.160
Right, they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching.


00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.280
So what does that mean?


00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.240
And I kind of view this as a couple different things.


00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.120
Number one, they devoted themselves to coming together


00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.280
to a place where the word of God was preached and taught.


00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.060
So you guys are here today,


00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.700
and I would kind of correlate that same similar feel


00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.580
of what they were doing.


00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.780
So check mark, you guys are at service on Sunday morning,


00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.940
dedicated, at least somewhat, to the church, right?


00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.060
You're here today, you're here coming to part of that.


00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.220
But let's see the other parts.


00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.340
He says they were dedicated to fellowship.


00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.100
And I've looked at the word fellowship,


00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.020
and the fellowship means this,


00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.740
the friendly association with people


00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.460
who share the same interests with the purpose


00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.220
of building relationships and challenging one another.


00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.420
So they dedicated themselves to fellowship.


00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.840
So who all here believes that you're getting


00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.560
good fellowship on Sunday mornings?


00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.720
Good fellowship, solid fellowship?


00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.580
Okay, a couple of y'all.


00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.400
I'm gonna tell you it's a lie.


00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.420
We don't spend enough time together


00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.720
to get to true fellowship.


00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:51.500
And I'm just, you guys love probably


00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.420
having me share these things.


00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:58.200
Sunday morning is not good fellowship, it's fellowship.


00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.440
and it's good, but it's not the best fellowship


00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.280
that he's talking about here.


00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.160
The fellowship they were talking about,


00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.040
they spent time together.


00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.280
I mean, time.


00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.360
Time not doing tasks, where we're all serving


00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.000
and running and going or whatever,


00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.840
just sitting under preaching or sitting under,


00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.080
you know, whatever.


00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.760
Fellowship, time.


00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.480
So yes, they had the time devoted to Sunday mornings,


00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.700
but the fellowship is more than that.


00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.080
So much more than that.


00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.840
But then he says they spent time


00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.560
devoting time together to break bread,


00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.640
And so I'm like, what's the difference


00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.840
between breaking bread and fellowship?


00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.080
And I would say this, it's eating together without purpose.


00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.240
You guys ever go to eat with somebody


00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.960
and you know that they have an agenda?


00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.860
Maybe you've had a lunch with me and you felt that way.


00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.640
Okay, and it's a challenge to me as I begin to study this


00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.200
because I think at times I go to lunch


00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.920
and I go to breakfast and I go to coffee


00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.040
and I hang out with people and I invite people over


00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.360
for dinner with an agenda in mind.


00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.300
When I look here and I say, man,


00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.300
I should just spend more time hanging out with these people.


00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.080
Just chilling on the couch, right?


00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.020
Just asking how life's going.


00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.100
What you're struggling with, what's good, right?


00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.960
So they spend time breaking bread


00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.520
and enjoying one another's company.


00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.000
I call this doing life together, right?


00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.680
Maybe you're gonna go to Topgolf and hit some golf balls


00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.460
and just not have an agenda behind it.


00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.440
Then the last one is to prayer.


00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.880
And when we look at this in the last section of this,


00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.760
you would think, okay, well,


00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.380
they were committed to individual prayer.


00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.220
I actually believe as we begin to study a little bit


00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.300
about this that when he correlates this to everything,


00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.120
when they were devoted to the apostles' teaching,


00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.420
they were together.


00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.220
When they were devoted to fellowship, they were together.


00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.800
When they were devoted to breaking of bread,


00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.640
they were together.


00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.000
I believe when they were devoted to prayer,


00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.700
they were together.


00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.980
So he says that they devoted themselves to praying together


00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.380
for one another's needs and requests before God.


00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.600
So can somebody summarize this for me?


00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.900
What did they devote themselves to?


00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.720
It's one word.


00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.180
Anybody?


00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.160
Community, yes, Amanda got it, community.


00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.960
They devoted themselves to community.


00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.800
And we're gonna see what the outflow of community is,


00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.960
but guys, I'm telling you, when I read the word of God


00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.040
and I see something so clear,


00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.680
where they devoted themselves to these things,


00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.080
and we're gonna see the benefit


00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.340
of devoting themselves to each other, to community.


00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.440
There's a benefit to it.


00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.480
So let's jump into the benefit.


00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.220
What was the result of spending time with benefit?


00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.600
Benefiting them, right?


00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.160
So verse 43, and I literally saw this this week


00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.320
and it stuck out to me.


00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.600
I used to look at verse 43 this way.


00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.760
Everyone was filled with all,


00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.000
and again I'm gonna translate it


00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.260
the way I used to read it in my head.


00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.600
Everyone was filled with all


00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.560
because of the many wonders and signs


00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.200
that were performed by the apostles.


00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.860
That's the way I used to read it.


00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.280
This time around, I'm gonna tell you how I read it


00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.280
because this is actually how it is read in the Bible,


00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.880
at least in my version here.


00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.680
Everyone was filled with awe, comma,


00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.900
and many wonders and signs were performed


00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.020
through the apostles.


00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.120
I want you to see this.


00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.440
Don't miss this.


00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.740
The community of believers that gathered together


00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.980
were filled in awe because of the commitment to community.


00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.500
And there was apostles doing some crazy cool things


00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.600
that was great to see.


00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.500
They were in awe because of the community


00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.780
that they were a part of.


00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.180
Oh man, like that stuck out to me this week.


00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.440
What does it mean to be in awe?


00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.340
I think it means to be inspired, to be encouraged, right?


00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.100
To doing life with one another.


00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.600
I just think that's so cool.


00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.840
So they were in awe of this time


00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.840
that they spent together in community.


00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.680
And as we look at this,


00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.600
and that encouragement of community,


00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.960
Who here struggles to be a part of anything


00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.240
outside of the crazy life of work,


00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.880
and your kids' activities,


00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.120
and all the responsibilities you have?


00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.280
I mean, even kids, you guys have a lot of responsibilities


00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.200
at school and things like that.


00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.840
Anybody struggle with being a part of anything


00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.600
outside of what my kids are a part of,


00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.840
what my work schedule is,


00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.280
and any things I gotta get done around the house?


00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.720
All of us struggle with time.


00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.960
So when we talk about community,


00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.060
I would say this, if I was to poll this group,


00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.720
most of you would say, I want a community like this.


00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.480
And we're gonna talk more about what the community brought.


00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.080
I want a community like this, but can I be truthful?


00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.840
Because I've been there.


00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.840
Truth is, it's easier to make excuses than to make plans


00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.440
to attend a part of a community, to be a part of a community.


00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.760
It's easier to make excuses.


00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.400
Now, the reason why I say this, and so you know,


00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.080
I've been there before, I've been there before,


00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.280
because the thing is, you're gonna have to sacrifice


00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.740
something for the sake of something better.


00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:46.140
Sacrifice something for the sake of something better.


00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.180
So I always go back to these examples in my life


00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.700
because I've been there before.


00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.580
When we moved from Oklahoma, we had something great,


00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.300
a great community of people,


00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.400
and we left that something to sacrifice


00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.860
to experience something greater.


00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.900
And so here's the cool part.


00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.940
If you're in this room, and people who are online


00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.820
who are sick and who may listen to this message later,


00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.600
you all are better.


00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.720
Don't tell the people back in Oklahoma that.


00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.980
But you're better, why?


00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.580
Because the sacrifice was worth the reward.


00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.580
So I say that to say this, that when we begin to talk


00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.980
more and more about the value of community,


00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.980
it may take you sacrificing something in your life


00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.120
to be a part of community outside of a Sunday morning,


00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.100
a community of people, but the benefit outweighs


00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.200
the sacrifice that you'll give up.


00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.040
Trust me, I've experienced it.


00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.180
Well, what do you mean you've experienced it?


00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.820
I believe that when we started this church,


00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.400
we experienced this community.


00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.800
We all were in the same home, and there was no other church


00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.400
with the home and we met every week


00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.120
and we built this community that we loved


00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.760
and we built this community that we're strong together.


00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.120
And I experienced that community


00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.640
and I believe that I'm experiencing it again


00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.400
in the new Inspire group that we've started.


00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.080
And there's more to it.


00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.700
So let's talk more, I'm gonna come back to that.


00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.080
But verse 44 tells us this, it says this in verse 44,


00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.640
it says, "Now all the people and believers were together


00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.080
"and held all things in common."


00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.800
So what was the result of spending time in community?


00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.540
The awe that they experienced, but also the peace


00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.380
and unity.


00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.000
I'll just be honest with you guys.


00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.840
In the world that we live in today,


00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.520
finding peace and unity with the people is difficult.


00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.820
It seems like there's always division


00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.360
either in your family, some friends, something.


00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.700
But this group found peace and unity under Christ.


00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.740
And I think that's something that we should desire.


00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.200
And so you know, these people were not all


00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.080
from the same backgrounds.


00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.400
If you'll go back to Pentecost,


00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.680
which is when this revival began to happen


00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.480
"and they preached to these 3,000 people.


00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.940
"These were people of all cultural backgrounds."


00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.460
So do you think that they held everything in common


00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.440
as though they had all the same likes


00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.420
and beliefs and backgrounds?


00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.280
Absolutely not.


00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.800
We're talking about a different group of people,


00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.160
but they found unity and peace under Christ.


00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.720
So that is beautiful when we think


00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.840
about what community brings.


00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.640
Community also brought generosity.


00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.740
So we see here in verse 45,


00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.700
"They sold their possessions and property


00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:15.180
and distributed to proceeds all that had need, right?


00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.180
So they begin to be transformed by the gospel


00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.300
in such a way that they begin to be generous


00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.160
to those who had a need.


00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.020
I think that's so cool.


00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.740
This community brought just generosity


00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.180
and meeting each other's needs.


00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.140
And so it was awe and inspiring, right?


00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.820
It was one that brought peace and unity.


00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.540
It was one that brought generosity.


00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.320
And if it can't get any better, right,


00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.820
if it can't get any better, they continued in verse 46.


00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.320
So you know, I'm walking through this quickly


00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.600
because of the idea behind what we're trying


00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.000
to bring out from the text.


00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.320
But he says this, "Every day they devoted themselves


00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.980
"to meeting together in the temple,


00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.760
"broke bread from house to house,


00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.600
"and they ate their food with joyful and sincere hearts."


00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.360
I asked myself this question, 'cause I see the first one,


00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.840
they devoted themselves to these things,


00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.040
and then every day together they did these things.


00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.640
And I'm like, sometimes you can just take those two things


00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.840
and say, hey, they devoted themselves.


00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.600
I look at this as this.


00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.440
They begin to devote themselves to these things,


00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.860
They sacrificed to do this, just so you know.


00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.720
They had activities they were doing


00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.340
before they gave their lives to Christ


00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.280
that they had to give up to go be a part of this community.


00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.680
Once they experienced the community,


00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.000
they continued because they saw the benefit.


00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.760
Do you see what I'm saying here?


00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.560
Because if it was not beneficial, what would they have done?


00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.000
They would have went back to what they were doing before.


00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.180
Sometimes you don't know if the grass is greener


00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.760
on the other side until you step over the other side


00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.360
and experience that it is.


00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.580
Now that may be a horrible example


00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.420
'cause a lot of times we tell you


00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.240
not to look at the other side


00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.080
because grass is not always greener on the other side,


00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.660
but this is what this community tells you, it is.


00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.680
It's worth the sacrifice to be a part of community.


00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:53.600
And he says the result of this community


00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.500
was to be joyful or to be happy and sincere in heart,


00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.080
which is to be compassionate,


00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.880
so much so that they praise God


00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.400
for the life change they experience


00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.480
and the community that God gave them.


00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.840
I love this and I think it's so important.


00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.480
they didn't complain to God about the community


00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.080
that God brought to them,


00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.840
because that community brought so much benefit to them.


00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.000
But here's the other part of it, right?


00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.140
So living in community encourages us,


00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.480
but it also prepares us for the ministry assignment


00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.620
to share our faith, right?


00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.460
This is what we're talking about,


00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.480
is to practically share our faith.


00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.800
Look at what it says here at the beginning of 47.


00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.640
It says that they were praising God


00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.960
and enjoying the favor of all people.


00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.440
enjoying God, worshiping God, praising God,


00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.480
and enjoying the favor of all people.


00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.400
There's something about a godly community of people


00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.800
who are inspired by God,


00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.160
that God uses to open the door to share our faith.


00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.940
When you have a godly community of people


00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.800
that are meeting together and experiencing these things,


00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.480
can somebody tell me who's watching?


00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.640
Who's watching?


00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.840
Who's watching?


00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.560
God, okay, who else is watching?


00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:10.440
Kids, what?


00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.320
The world.


00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.320
And when the world sees a community of people, because I'm just telling you guys, you know


00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.580
it right now, there's not a lot of unity in a lot of places.


00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:25.160
When they see a group of people, a community of people unified in peace that are excited


00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:31.480
to be together, that are changing the world through generosity, they want to be a part


00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.480
of it.


00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.120
I mean, that's the truth.


00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.000
Now what you may be asking is, "Man, I'm waiting for that community.


00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.280
Once they create it, I'll go be a part of it."


00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.800
And if you be a part of it and you're not willing to help create it, you'll probably


00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.800
run it.


00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.800
I'll say that again.


00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.640
If you want to be a part of a community like that and you're not willing to help create


00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.720
that community, then if you ever join that part of the community, you'll probably run


00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.720
it.


00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.720
I'm sorry.


00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.880
I'm just sharing with you.


00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.120
The truth of this is that it takes each one of us


00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.960
to create that community.


00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.400
It takes each one of us to sacrifice


00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.460
to be a part of that community.


00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.400
So that as we're a part of that community,


00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.200
because we love that community,


00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.700
that God gives us favor with people


00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.680
outside of the community that need to hear the gospel,


00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.400
that desire to experience this beautiful community


00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.820
that God creates.


00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.540
So living in community obviously encourages us


00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.400
and prepares us, but I believe living in community


00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.220
gives us the opportunity to practically evangelize.


00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.980
We saw that briefly in verse 47


00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.660
on the beginning of it, right?


00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.660
But as we look into this verse,


00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.780
as they devoted themselves to living in community,


00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.880
what happens?


00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.860
It says this at the end.


00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.900
It says, "Every day the Lord added to their number


00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.980
"those who were being saved."


00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.340
Those who were being saved.


00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:51.600
I would say this, is that to practically share our faith


00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.900
is as simple as living in community


00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.480
and being a part of something this beautiful.


00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.480
Because you won't have to go knock down the doors


00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.640
of people to share the gospel with them


00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.560
to get them to give their lives to Jesus.


00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.160
They'll knock down your doors and they'll ask you why


00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:11.320
you believe what you believe and why God has created


00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.120
so much unity in your community,


00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.380
why God is doing what he's doing in your life.


00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.560
And I would say this, as we begin to serve our community


00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.000
over these last two or three years,


00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.160
and as we continue to serve through the schools


00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.160
and through all these ministries that we're a part of,


00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:28.360
people are starting to ask these questions, why?


00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.440
And this is the great part.


00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.920
Every time I get to answer, Jesus, why?


00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.420
Jesus.


00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.020
And here's the thing, maybe they're not completely just,


00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.920
oh man, they're giving lives to Christ left and right,


00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.600
but here's what I'm starting to see.


00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.540
We're finding favor with people.


00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.940
But I'll just tell you this,


00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:51.840
that community that God has created doesn't always last


00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.440
unless we all help create it.


00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.320
You can't let one group of people,


00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.260
or one group of people be the only community


00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.040
that is creating this.


00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.600
We need to all be a part of this community.


00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.520
And so my challenge to you is,


00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.620
when we think about a community like this,


00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:15.540
is are you a part of a community that is,


00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.020
and I'm talking about a community outside of Sunday mornings


00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.060
and let me just challenge you,


00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.720
I think those are inspire groups that we have


00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.040
and inspire groups that we wanna start,


00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.440
which means people that are doing life together.


00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.240
Are you a part of a community that you're seeing


00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.120
these things so that you can have favor with people


00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.600
so that more people will come to faith in Christ?


00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.760
And if you're saying, hey, this isn't present in my life,


00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.700
my challenge for you is maybe God's telling you today


00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.660
that you need to join a community of people


00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.480
and devote yourself to him.


00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.280
To join a community of people and devote yourself to him.


00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.120
Maybe he's not.


00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.240
That's between you and the Lord,


00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.720
but that's just the conviction that I have.


00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.480
So what happens as a result of a community


00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.600
finding favor with all people.


00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.440
The Lord adds numbers to those being saved.


00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.420
I would just say this, and I've heard this from many of you,


00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:07.580
do you want other people to experience hope in Jesus?


00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:11.440
The majority of you, if you've given your life to Christ,


00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.560
are saying yes.


00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.520
If you haven't, you're probably saying I don't know.


00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.720
But if you have given your life to Jesus,


00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.560
and you hear that question, do you want people


00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.260
to come to faith in Christ?


00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.800
Do you want people to experience what you've experienced?


00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.700
If you do, follow Jesus through a daily relationship


00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:32.480
with him and live in community.


00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.700
'Cause out of the overflow of those two things will result.


00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.500
God will use the spirit of God inside of you


00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.820
and in spite of that group of people to change the world


00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.200
and to lead people to faith in Christ.


00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.220
We've been given this example and when I look at the word,


00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.180
I look at the word as a timeless word.


00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.240
If it worked then, why can't it work now?


00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.320
and you wanna know what the same thing is similar then


00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.500
as it is to now?


00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.040
The Holy Spirit.


00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:58.880
It's God.


00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.480
It's God, because you may say,


00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.200
well, that's the beginning of the church era.


00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.280
That's whenever the Spirit of God began to spread


00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.440
like it's never spread before


00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.560
and it just doesn't do that anymore.


00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.280
And I'd be like, yeah, it does.


00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:13.920
It can, if we wanna be a part of it.


00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.500
So how do we practically share faith?


00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.600
I've already shared that with you, right?


00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.840
Week one, we talked about that.


00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.840
Follow Jesus week two this week.


00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.960
is to be in community, what's our response?


00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.080
I'm just gonna be quick to this


00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.280
because I think you guys have heard enough.


00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.940
As we go into a time of invitation,


00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.440
we take time to consider where we are.


00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.740
Consider where we are.


00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:35.960
And I'm just gonna tell you,


00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.080
you may, this may be your first Sunday,


00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:42.680
this may be your 197th Sunday, I don't know.


00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.140
And you've been hearing this statement,


00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.880
give your life to Jesus.


00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.400
Jesus can transform your life,


00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.000
be a part of a community of people


00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.040
that can transform your life.


00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.960
And you may just continue to have been that person


00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.740
to just say, nah, I don't need Jesus.


00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.740
Nah, I don't wanna experience God in this way.


00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.840
I'm just gonna challenge you today,


00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.640
maybe today is the day that you give your life to Jesus.


00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.440
But today is the day that you begin to experience


00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.780
the hope of the gospel.


00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.560
What we're talking about here to practically evangelize,


00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.120
we want to do that,


00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.880
but if you haven't given your life to Jesus,


00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.520
that won't be something that's on your radar


00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.000
even prioritize because you don't see the value


00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
in giving your life to Jesus.


00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.960
So I think that's where you start.


00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.800
That's where you start.


00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.060
How do you give your life to Jesus?


00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.200
It's by admitting that you're a sinner,


00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.480
admitting that you need to give your life to Jesus,


00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.880
admitting that you need him to forgive you,


00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.840
admitting that you can't be transformed


00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.700
and be used by God without him.


00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.100
And then after you give your life to Jesus,


00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.240
those of us that have already given our lives to Jesus,


00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.760
what's the response?


00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.120
It's for us to look and say this,


00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.100
Lord, use me.


00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:53.060
I'm telling you, don't miss out on the opportunity


00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.820
to be used by God.


00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.080
I wake up every day as a pastor,


00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.540
and just so you know, so many times I forget


00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.740
that I'm a pastor, I wake up every day as a Christ follower,


00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.200
and I say, Lord, use me.


00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.360
Please.


00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.100
I feel like I'm just like the apostles,


00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.180
broken, confused at times.


00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.080
I don't know enough.


00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.860
I have all the excuses and God says I can still use you


00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.080
because the power of God, the spirit of God


00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.340
that's inside of us is more powerful


00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.320
than what I bring to the table.


00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.220
So don't miss out on the opportunity to change eternity


00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:34.880
for someone else by sharing the gospel,


00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.940
by inviting people into this community here.


00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.340
So I challenged you earlier.


00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:43.300
I said, hey, Sunday mornings are not a place of fellowship.


00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.260
They are.


00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.420
They're just not a long-term solution


00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.580
of deep fellowship that God's called us to.


00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:52.340
Those of you that are obviously from Inspiring Hope here,


00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.380
we have inspire groups.


00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.300
We only have two going on right now, but they're not full.


00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.700
Your guys' isn't full, right?


00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.500
Ours isn't full, and we'll start more.


00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.340
Why?


00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.700
Because I believe this, as we commit


00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.220
to living in community outside of this Sunday morning,


00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.180
that we're gonna continue to see people


00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.300
come to faith in Christ.


00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:14.880
We're gonna continue to be all inspired when we meet.


00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.580
But if you wanna miss out on it, don't be a part of it.


00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.380
I just hope you do.


00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:23.880
I want you to be a part of it.


00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.200
I think God wants to transform our church community


00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.640
through prioritizing community.


00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.460
So let's pray.


00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.520
Lord Jesus, I pray that, Lord,


00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.000
that this message was clear.


00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.140
Lord, that as we look into your word and we say,


00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:45.280
Lord, how do we practically share our faith?


00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.560
Sometimes I think we try to get all the words right,


00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.440
but Lord, you just told us to just devote ourselves


00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.060
to the right community.


00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.800
And if we'll just do that,


00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:59.480
that the result of that will provide an opportunity


00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.680
to share our faith with others.


00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.640
It'll be an overflow of that community


00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.900
that shares who you are with them.


00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.220
God, I pray if there's a person in this room


00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.340
that doesn't know you,


00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.620
that hasn't given their lives to you,


00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.140
that hasn't repented of their sins


00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.780
and experienced a true saving faith,


00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.060
Lord, I pray that today they do that.


00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:20.340
Lord, I pray that as I stand in the back of the room,


00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.820
Lord, if there's a question that they have


00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:22.980
about how to give their lives to Christ,


00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.900
that they'll come and find me and ask.


00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.820
Lord, I also just pray for those who are in this room,


00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.580
Lord, that haven't experienced


00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.980
that community throughout the week,


00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.500
that one that you can do life with,


00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.860
that you can challenge one another


00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.240
and experience powerful prayer


00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.980
and powerful timing the word together


00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.660
and powerful challenging and equipping.


00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.280
Lord, I pray that that person in this room


00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.040
is challenged to go find an inspired group this week.


00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.520
Lord, they'll come over to the next steps table


00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.180
and they'll ask, when's the next one?


00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.060
And they'll start attending,


00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:53.100
they'll start being a part of it.


00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.700
And they'll not only attend, but they'll participate.


00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:59.300
Lord, I just pray that you convict our hearts as a church


00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.820
not to miss this opportunity.


00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:04.860
Lord, to not just prioritize Sunday mornings,


00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.520
but to prioritize every day with each other,


00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.340
to challenge each other, to live our faith out.


00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.120
God, we love you, and we thank you,


00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.320
and we pray this in your heavenly name, amen.
