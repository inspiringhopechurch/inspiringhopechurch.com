00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.300
Well, good morning to everybody.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.280
I know that we, we, uh, may have as
many online today as we have in service.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.660
Um, and so if you're
online welcome as well.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.030
I know we have several families
that again, are traveling.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.200
A couple of them are out because of
some sickness and things like that.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.650
Um, and so, um, we're just, we're a
little bit lighter this morning, but

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.570
you know, one of the things I was
going to, I want to start off and talk

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.710
to you guys a little bit about this.

00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:35.995
Many of you, if not, all of you,
um, have had a church experience

00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:37.885
before coming to inspiring hope.

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:40.015
And typically it's a lot bigger than this.

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:40.285
Right.

00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:41.515
And some of y'all it's huge.

00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:41.905
Right.

00:00:42.565 --> 00:00:47.635
And so coming and being a part of a
new church, there's always this phase

00:00:47.694 --> 00:00:50.845
of newness, which means a lot of like,
you'll have Sundays where there's

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:52.135
like nobody, and then there's Sundays.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:52.855
There's a lot of people.

00:00:52.855 --> 00:00:54.114
And then we're just trying to grow.

00:00:54.114 --> 00:00:58.394
And, and so it's like, It's
probably difficult for you guys.

00:00:58.425 --> 00:00:59.625
And I understand that.

00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:02.085
And, and the reason why I say it's
difficult because it's different,

00:01:02.864 --> 00:01:04.065
but different is not always bad.

00:01:04.245 --> 00:01:04.634
Right?

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:07.725
I think different can be good because
I think in moments like this, this is

00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:11.865
where you'll start actually getting
to know people and what I would even

00:01:11.865 --> 00:01:14.955
say this as you get to be a part of
something from the beginning, and when

00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:17.384
you get to be a part of something from
the beginning, it becomes almost like

00:01:17.384 --> 00:01:23.414
some, I don't know, And so one, again,
everybody in this room has been coming

00:01:23.414 --> 00:01:24.885
for at least three or four weeks.

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:29.295
And so even though it's new, I
appreciate you guys hanging around

00:01:29.384 --> 00:01:32.745
because there's some people that
can't, because they're just, they can't

00:01:32.745 --> 00:01:35.145
handle the small smallness of a church.

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:38.895
And again, if you end up not
staying, that's why you got to

00:01:38.895 --> 00:01:39.825
do what God leads you to do.

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:42.164
But what I would just say in this is that.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.100
I encourage you to continue to keep
coming and be a part of it because

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.070
you could be a part of growing this
church and reaching more people,

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.169
um, and creating something special.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.530
One of the things I, I just, I want
to just mention off-hand, we're going

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.089
to get into this in this text today.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.889
Um, but this idea behind community
and relationships and how important

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:05.490
that is, and the more and more that
I talk to individuals in this church,

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.180
this is what they say the community
is what's drawn us here, which means.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.610
You know, getting to know each other.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.510
And the smaller group has allowed us
to really just grow together as, as

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.680
people and get to know each other.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.980
And so that's really, what's really
the identity behind why we're here.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.640
Um, and so like, I look at that
and I say, you know, let's not take

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.170
this for granted and let's continue.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.450
That's why we take the space in
between as the kids transition.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.290
And we take five minutes.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.710
Why?

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.250
Because I got to have two great
conversations that I wouldn't

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.170
get to have if we're just rushing
through a service to have.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.800
And so, yes, we're a new church and we're
still trying to figure this thing out.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.490
We're still small, but man, you get
to be a part of something that grows

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.160
and continues to reach more people,
to invite them into that type of

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.800
a community where we get to know
each other and do life together.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.560
And so one just thank you
for being a part of this.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.470
And I know for some of you, again,
still neutral, still trying to

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.600
figure out if this is where God's
leading you and that's okay.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.880
Um, you have to be led where God leads.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.020
You just like, God, let us.

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.839
Um, and so, um, we're going to be in,
I'm going to go ahead and transition

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.989
off that thought we're going to be in
first Timothy chapter one, we're gonna

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.429
be finishing up chapter one today.

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:11.350
So we're going to be in verses 18
through 20, only three verses today.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.929
Those three verses are
actually pretty powerful.

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:17.560
So we covering the rest of
chapter one of first Timothy.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.029
And so I want to ask this question,
anybody ever attempted something so

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.459
great that if God didn't show up.

00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:27.435
There's no way that it
would have been successful.

00:03:27.435 --> 00:03:31.364
Anybody attempted anything so
difficult that if God didn't show

00:03:31.364 --> 00:03:32.894
up, you knew you would fell anybody.

00:03:34.454 --> 00:03:34.815
Okay.

00:03:35.475 --> 00:03:35.984
Yes.

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:36.285
No.

00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:36.554
Okay.

00:03:36.554 --> 00:03:38.114
Some of y'all maybe none of y'all.

00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:38.505
Okay.

00:03:38.655 --> 00:03:41.924
My challenge is to try something
like that and, um, I'll kind

00:03:41.924 --> 00:03:43.005
of connect some pieces here.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:45.165
Well, we've started here.

00:03:45.205 --> 00:03:46.815
Inspiring hope is very similar to that.

00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:51.045
We started something where we had
God, if, if we do this, if you don't

00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:54.675
show up this thing's going to fell
and God continues to do that here.

00:03:54.675 --> 00:03:58.095
And it reminds me of William Carey,
William Carey made this statement.

00:03:58.095 --> 00:03:59.265
He's a great missionary.

00:03:59.715 --> 00:04:04.185
Um, it says we need to expect
great things from God, and we need

00:04:04.185 --> 00:04:05.355
to attempt to great things from.

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:08.775
We need to expect great
things from God and we need to

00:04:08.775 --> 00:04:10.395
attempt great things for God.

00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:14.505
And so, as we catch up in this
chapter, um, we're going to really

00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:16.695
talk about the power of our calling.

00:04:16.935 --> 00:04:19.815
And we're gonna look at how
Paul reminds Timothy that there

00:04:19.815 --> 00:04:22.485
is power in remembering his.

00:04:23.445 --> 00:04:26.715
So the role in which he's
playing here, uh, in this book.

00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:31.875
Um, and, and, and so today what God ends
up inviting us into, and I'm just going

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:34.935
to kind of give you a preview of this,
what God ends up inviting us into is

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:40.185
to do something in our lives, in which
there's no way we would be successful

00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:41.865
at doing it unless God shows up.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.640
I don't know about you guys, but I want to
continue to do things in which challenges

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.670
me spiritually, because I don't want to
really dishonor God with small thinking.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.810
I want to honor God with big
thinking, which says that God can

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.620
do exceedingly abundantly more
than we can ask or think, right.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.380
He, he says that in his word,
he wants to do exceedingly

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.790
abundantly more in and through.

00:05:06.555 --> 00:05:10.395
And we can think and imagine,
and if that's the God that wants

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:13.515
to do that in us, we now need to
believe that God wants to do that.

00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:16.425
And so, as Paul is challenging
Timothy and some tough seasons of

00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:19.455
his life and his ministry, he's
reminded him that same thing.

00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:20.865
Don't forget that God's called you.

00:05:20.895 --> 00:05:22.485
Don't forget that God's placed you here.

00:05:22.485 --> 00:05:24.915
Don't forget that God's given
you the ability to be successful.

00:05:25.455 --> 00:05:28.715
So as we talk about the power and
our calling, one of the things

00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:31.025
you may be asked in this question,
Hey, there's power in our.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.830
One, what is my calling?

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.990
That may be one of the questions
you're asking, or maybe the

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.990
second question really would be
as, so what's my purpose in life.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.090
So the cool thing here is a church in our
mission statement is we really believe

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.260
that we've been called as a church to
help people discover God's purpose for

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.620
their life through relationship with
Jesus, which means this, everything

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.880
that we're about is helping people.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.780
No Jesus more.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.800
And as they know Jesus more, they begin
to discover that calling or that purpose.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.140
And so it's cool how this
all kind of comes together.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.180
As Paul's talking to Timothy to remember
his call of how we need to be challenged,

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.950
to continue to remember our call, right.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.130
And for many of us, right, we have
jobs or we're taking care of kids

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.370
at home, or we have activities or
hobbies that we're all a part of.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.150
And so for most of us, that's
not necessarily article.

00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:22.125
But it's the place in
which we fulfill our call.

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:25.845
So I'll say that again, our
jobs are taking care of our kids

00:06:25.845 --> 00:06:27.315
to our hobbies or activities.

00:06:27.315 --> 00:06:30.735
Not, may not necessarily be our call
on like an actually what we're doing,

00:06:30.945 --> 00:06:34.395
but the place in which we're doing
those things is the place in which

00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:38.955
God's called us to fulfill our call
or given us the ability to do that.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.180
And so we know this though, life sometimes
tough and we wonder how can we do that?

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.969
If our jobs difficult or
our kids are diff difficult.

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:50.039
And I know some of your kids are
in the room, so you can't nod

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:51.539
when I say that, okay, I get it.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.310
Um, but we know that God will give
us the power and ability to do that.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.710
So I'm just gonna kind of summarize
chapter one before we jump in.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.000
So we're all kind of caught up.

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:05.909
So in this first chapter of Timothy,
um, so Paul, the apostle, um, is

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:09.419
writing to Timothy, who is the
pastor of this church in emphasis.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.500
Um, and so, so you guys know being a
pastor is not always easy and that's

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.180
exactly what Timothy was dealing with.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.660
He's dealing with teachers and people
within the church that are teaching

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.690
things contrary to the gospel, not truth.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.740
So as Paul has challenged him in
this first chapter to address these

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.430
false teaching, and he says this
to address them with love, right.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.640
And, and to understand
exactly what they're teaching

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.960
falsely so that he can tell.

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:36.359
The truth.

00:07:36.359 --> 00:07:38.580
And so the first week we talked
about that, our challenge is

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.929
to teach the truth, right?

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:44.789
And then last week we talked about
Paul's powerful testimony and how

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:48.270
there's power in our testimonies
power and our testimonies.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.919
And I made this statement that it's only
powerful if we share it, because if not,

00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:56.535
It's only good enough for us, meaning
if we don't ever share it, it's only

00:07:56.535 --> 00:08:00.255
powerful for us, but really the power is
when we actually share that testimony.

00:08:00.255 --> 00:08:03.735
And Paul, we know that because he
shared his testimony, our lives have

00:08:03.735 --> 00:08:08.335
changed and many other people's lives
are changed because they heard a pulse.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.620
But this week, we're going to jump into
this where we're Paul turns to Timothy

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:18.330
and he charges him to remember his calling
that was given to him in the power that

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.520
it has to help him not give up and to help
him not ship wreck his faith, like some.

00:08:24.544 --> 00:08:28.234
So let's jump into this text so we can
all kind of get an idea of where, what,

00:08:28.234 --> 00:08:30.065
what, what w what we're talking about.

00:08:30.065 --> 00:08:31.474
And then we'll just kind
of walk through it here.

00:08:31.474 --> 00:08:35.855
So again, first Timothy chapter
one, verse 18 says this, it says,

00:08:35.855 --> 00:08:40.954
Timothy, my son, I'm giving you
this instruction in keeping with the

00:08:40.954 --> 00:08:43.204
prophecies previously made about you.

00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:46.805
So that by recalling them,
you may fight the good.

00:08:47.849 --> 00:08:52.530
Having faith and a good conscience,
some have rejected these and have

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:57.689
shipwrecked their faith among them
are high minibus and Alexander whom

00:08:57.689 --> 00:09:02.339
I have delivered to Satan so that
they may be taught not to blasting.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.930
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.400
We just thank you Lord for today.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.089
And Lord, we just ask and that you are.

00:09:10.155 --> 00:09:12.375
Going to work through this message,
Lord, this you're going to work through

00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:16.454
your words to open our hearts, Lord to
how this applies to us, Lord, how we

00:09:16.454 --> 00:09:20.895
are reminded of the powerful call that
you've given us to go live our lifestyle.

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:25.995
And so Lord help us, um, today,
um, understand this knowledge

00:09:26.025 --> 00:09:27.375
and go out and live it.

00:09:27.435 --> 00:09:28.935
And so we just pray this
in your headline name.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.690
So we see in this first verse
and I always love how I kind of

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.470
break some of these verses up.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.050
There's so much in one verse, I'll
just break it up into two things.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.560
And so we're going to look at 18 a,
I always love 18, 8, 1800, which is

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.570
just the first part of the verse.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.550
And we're gonna look at kind
of just, I'm going to walk

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.140
through this text very detailed.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.110
And so hopefully it will make
sense as we walk through this.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.630
But the first thing that sticks out
to me as I walked through this text

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.510
and, and, and I'll just kind of step
out here and mention this one thing.

00:09:55.305 --> 00:09:58.155
I preach a little bit different
than most people and not that

00:09:58.155 --> 00:09:59.025
I'm right and they're wrong.

00:09:59.025 --> 00:10:00.675
It's just my personality and who I am.

00:10:00.915 --> 00:10:05.085
I typically like to teach or preach
the way in which I understand things,

00:10:05.085 --> 00:10:09.855
because for me, I remember sitting
under pastors as a new believer going,

00:10:10.185 --> 00:10:13.155
I don't know what that Greek word
is, and that sounds really smart.

00:10:13.185 --> 00:10:14.565
And I hope I can figure this out.

00:10:14.925 --> 00:10:18.885
And so for me, I'm consistently
trying to think of how can I teach in

00:10:18.885 --> 00:10:20.475
such a way that teaches you to eat.

00:10:21.995 --> 00:10:23.435
Come up with the same things that I am.

00:10:23.435 --> 00:10:23.645
Right.

00:10:23.645 --> 00:10:24.995
There's nothing special about me.

00:10:25.444 --> 00:10:28.265
You know, I just spend some time studying
the word and, and asking God what it is.

00:10:28.265 --> 00:10:31.535
And so when I teach, I kind of almost
invite you to kind of learn alongside me.

00:10:32.104 --> 00:10:34.625
Um, and, and so that I'm not
losing you with everything.

00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:36.365
And so I'm just going to walk
through this first reverse.

00:10:37.515 --> 00:10:39.135
Talk about things that
really just sticks out to me.

00:10:39.135 --> 00:10:42.105
And this is this first one, it
says, Timothy, my son, I stop

00:10:42.105 --> 00:10:45.885
right there and I go, number one,
Paul considers Timothy, his son.

00:10:45.885 --> 00:10:51.075
And while we've heard this before, when
we see back over in, in, uh, uh, the

00:10:51.075 --> 00:10:55.635
early part of these verses, um, he calls
him basically his true son in the faith.

00:10:55.635 --> 00:10:59.115
This is in verse two, Timothy,
my true son in the faith.

00:10:59.145 --> 00:11:00.195
And so Paul really.

00:11:01.065 --> 00:11:02.895
Looked at Timothy as his true son.

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:06.135
It wasn't his biological son, but
he had spent so much time with him

00:11:06.135 --> 00:11:07.995
that he called him his true son.

00:11:08.295 --> 00:11:11.445
So his relationship with Timothy
was so strong and so important

00:11:11.445 --> 00:11:12.525
throughout this whole letter.

00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:15.675
And so that had to comfort Timothy
as he was receiving instruction.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:19.755
And so you guys know this when
somebody gives you instruction, you

00:11:19.755 --> 00:11:23.505
typically receive it well or not
based upon how much you trust that.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.250
I mean, you guys know
what I'm talking about.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.130
Like you asked for directions and somebody
like, uh, I'm going to tell you where

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.420
this is, but they're not from this city.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.090
Like if you asked me the directions
in Hamilton, you probably

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.710
shouldn't trust me too much.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.060
I'm still getting used to Hamilton.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.630
I'm usually like go to the convenience
store that I don't know the name and

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.080
take a left on the road that I have
no clue where the roundabouts at.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.290
Right.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.430
That's usually how I'm going.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.200
So don't trust me on that.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:50.070
But this is different for Timothy because
he spent so much time with Paul and

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.450
Paul's calling him a true son in the face.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.390
This is something we're like,
Timothy is going to lean in and

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.880
say, I I'm going to listen to every
word you say, I'm unbelievable.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.420
Well, I look at the Bible that
way is because the Bible is really

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.949
transformed and changed my life.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.520
Whatever the word of God says, I began
to like lean in a little bit more

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.959
and say, okay, this is trustworthy.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.510
And so that's kind of the way
that Paul addresses Timothy is

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.760
like, Hey, my ch my son, right?

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.520
He says, I'm giving you this
instruction and keeping with the

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.959
prophecies previously made about.

00:12:17.235 --> 00:12:20.954
So as we look in this, as he says,
I'm giving you this instruction

00:12:21.194 --> 00:12:24.074
or for some of you, it may be in
this, it says the word charge.

00:12:24.105 --> 00:12:25.365
I'm giving you this charge.

00:12:26.444 --> 00:12:28.935
Um, and when we look at
this, what instruction.

00:12:29.959 --> 00:12:32.340
Is Paul talking to Timothy
about what instruction is

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.209
Paul talking to Timothy about?

00:12:33.209 --> 00:12:34.350
Well, he's talking about the instruction.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.550
He gave him to address false teaching
with love and what we just talked

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:43.860
about and to also, um, know that
your testimonies can change lives.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.250
Right?

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.330
So we know that this instruction that
Paul has given to him, He's been given

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.590
it to him, um, to be able to go use,
but then he also says he's given this

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.110
to him based upon the call in his life.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.900
And so, as he says this in keeping
with the instructions of the prophecies

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.990
previously made about you, that's
an interesting statement, right?

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.230
These prophecies were previously made
about Timothy and his call to be in

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.500
the role in which he's in all that
really means is there were some people

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.600
in the church, this salt Timothy's.

00:13:10.705 --> 00:13:12.564
They saw the gift of God on his hand.

00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:16.045
And they begin to say, Hey
Timothy, we believe this

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:18.385
position of pastor of emphasis.

00:13:18.385 --> 00:13:22.345
And this position of, uh, co
missionary journey, uh, with,

00:13:22.375 --> 00:13:24.325
with Paul is in your life.

00:13:24.535 --> 00:13:28.885
And so they prophesied that over him,
or they spoke that over Timothy's life.

00:13:29.215 --> 00:13:32.665
And so Paul is saying, Hey,
remember that these things were

00:13:32.665 --> 00:13:34.314
spoke over your life, right?

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:37.165
It's I'm giving you this instruction
because it aligns with your.

00:13:38.665 --> 00:13:38.905
Right.

00:13:38.905 --> 00:13:39.865
It aligns with your call.

00:13:41.314 --> 00:13:43.354
And so I still believe this happens today.

00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:46.655
I always tell people this, the more and
more I get to know somebody, I think we

00:13:46.655 --> 00:13:48.454
speak those truths over people's lives.

00:13:48.454 --> 00:13:51.755
As we begin to see potential in life,
we see God lining some things up.

00:13:51.785 --> 00:13:53.944
We begin to say, Hey, we
see this in your life.

00:13:54.395 --> 00:13:55.984
And it's very similar to Laura.

00:13:55.984 --> 00:13:58.625
She shared last week about
her call to ministry.

00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:01.385
And it's something that's so
interesting when, when Laura says,

00:14:01.385 --> 00:14:04.025
Hey, I really feel like God's
calling me to some form of ministry.

00:14:04.415 --> 00:14:06.155
We're not sitting there
going, never saw it.

00:14:06.214 --> 00:14:06.875
You know what we're saying?

00:14:06.875 --> 00:14:08.314
We've been with Laura
for the last year now.

00:14:08.945 --> 00:14:09.875
We're not surprised.

00:14:10.205 --> 00:14:12.905
We actually have been kind of even
speaking that of her life, but

00:14:12.905 --> 00:14:15.185
she just realized it for herself.

00:14:15.395 --> 00:14:20.015
So whenever this prophecy prophecy
was spoken over Timothy, it still

00:14:20.015 --> 00:14:21.425
took Timothy recognizing it.

00:14:21.785 --> 00:14:24.215
And so what Paul's doing is Paul
saying, even though this was spoke

00:14:24.215 --> 00:14:25.835
over, you still have to recognize it.

00:14:26.075 --> 00:14:28.115
You still need to remember this.

00:14:28.385 --> 00:14:29.495
It's powerful to it.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:30.900
The call.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.150
And so I still believe this happens today.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.080
And so how do we know this?

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.110
And so there's a couple of things I just
want to share with you is one that God

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.450
has given every single person a gift.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.170
So if you are alive today in breathing,
if you need to check your pulse, go ahead.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.590
But God has given you a gift.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.640
Now, the interesting thing with this
gift is that God gives us gifts not to.

00:14:51.675 --> 00:14:52.365
But to give away.

00:14:52.935 --> 00:14:57.975
So every one of us has a call and a gift
in our life to be used for God's glory.

00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:01.215
Now this just isn't on a Sunday
morning, during a two hour spot.

00:15:01.245 --> 00:15:01.755
Yes.

00:15:01.965 --> 00:15:03.795
You can go greet people
because you're social.

00:15:03.975 --> 00:15:07.215
You can be a coffee person cause
you love coffee or you can play an

00:15:07.215 --> 00:15:08.595
instrument because you're gifted in that.

00:15:09.015 --> 00:15:11.564
And those are parts of the gifts
that God gives us, but really the

00:15:11.564 --> 00:15:12.944
gift is meant to be used after.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.290
And the gift is meant to be
used for the body of Christ

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.280
and the benefit of each other.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.980
And so we know that's true, right?

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.920
So we've been appointed by God to
fulfill also the purpose to go there

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.240
for and make disciples of all nations,
which means this in some form, the

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.980
gift that God's given you is mint.

00:15:30.165 --> 00:15:31.965
Help other people know Jesus.

00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:32.535
Right?

00:15:32.565 --> 00:15:33.735
So that's, that's cool.

00:15:33.885 --> 00:15:35.085
Cause we know that connection right.

00:15:35.085 --> 00:15:38.085
To, to make disciples, to make sure
that people know Jesus personally.

00:15:38.685 --> 00:15:41.895
And so this is not something that's
different from us because sometimes

00:15:41.895 --> 00:15:44.115
we read these and we go, oh, there's
not been a prophecy made about.

00:15:45.645 --> 00:15:48.915
Well, maybe somebody hasn't spoke
that over your life, but I would say

00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:52.694
this though, that the word of God has
said that each one of us has a call

00:15:52.694 --> 00:15:54.795
on our life or our gift on a call.

00:15:54.795 --> 00:15:57.105
And it's the bigger part of
the body of Christ to fulfill.

00:15:57.555 --> 00:16:00.795
And so we also have a
powerful call just like timid.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.720
And I started thinking about
this a little bit last week.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.330
And I think I shared this last
week, you see my role, the Bible

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.840
says my role is to equip the saints
for the work of the ministry.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.220
And I made this statement.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.860
So that means that all of us are
called to some form of ministry.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.980
And most of us probably don't
like that idea, which, because

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.439
it's like, well, I'm not a pastor
and that's not what I'm saying.

00:16:19.439 --> 00:16:20.640
Every one of us has a different role.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.150
But if my role is to equip the saints,
that means every single time we meet here

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.310
on Sundays, I'm using the word of God.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.340
To equip you were taking
it, weren't applying it.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.860
We're looking here and we're
saying, well, Paul's giving Timothy

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:37.170
a charge to go use his, his call
and his gift for the glory of God.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:38.760
So what are we going to do today?

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.030
We're going to go into the word of
God and we're going to look at it.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.470
And it's going to challenge
us just like Paul.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.410
We're gonna listen to Paul and we're
going to say, oh, we have a call.

00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:50.790
That's powerful to go take the message
of the gospel, where we are in our

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.670
church and in our community to go
live it out for the glory of God.

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:56.235
And so that is encouraging to me.

00:16:56.235 --> 00:16:56.475
Right?

00:16:56.475 --> 00:16:59.415
And so just like Paul giving Timothy
and the instruction to fulfill his

00:16:59.415 --> 00:17:02.805
call, he's also giving us the church
instruction to fulfill our calls.

00:17:02.805 --> 00:17:05.295
And I wanna just kind of read this
to teach the truth and love to

00:17:05.295 --> 00:17:08.714
share our testimonies, that point
people to Jesus, his love grace and

00:17:08.714 --> 00:17:10.425
mercy into address false teaching.

00:17:10.425 --> 00:17:11.685
That's contrary to the good news.

00:17:11.954 --> 00:17:13.275
That's our same call as well.

00:17:13.845 --> 00:17:15.464
It's the same thing that
Paul is speaking to us here.

00:17:15.855 --> 00:17:18.555
And Josh, I'm so glad you showed
up because I started thinking

00:17:18.555 --> 00:17:20.954
through this and this is something
challenge challenging to me.

00:17:20.954 --> 00:17:22.065
I just started thinking through, right?

00:17:22.065 --> 00:17:22.815
What does this look like in our.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:27.119
And see, I get to spend time with
Josh mentoring, some young boys and

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.700
Josh, you're the one that's kind of
spearheaded this and got to go in.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.470
And obviously you got some
teachers that are working with you.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:36.450
And I started thinking through
this part of Josh's call is that he

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.090
builds, led to mentor young boys.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.940
And I started thinking about this right
to mentor young boys into becoming

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.710
positive influences in the school, on
his city to teach the truth to these.

00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:52.185
And to share how his life has been
changed, because he has begin to take in

00:17:52.185 --> 00:17:56.475
truth and not write the false influences
of the world or false influences of

00:17:56.685 --> 00:17:58.725
maybe kids in his, in their life.

00:17:58.725 --> 00:17:58.965
Right.

00:17:58.965 --> 00:18:02.564
And so he's there to help address
those false teachings that those

00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:06.254
kids have been hearing that, Hey,
you don't need to accept this.

00:18:06.254 --> 00:18:07.965
You need to accept that.

00:18:08.145 --> 00:18:12.074
And so part of his role and
passion that I can see, this

00:18:12.074 --> 00:18:13.245
is just my personal conviction.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:19.740
Mentoring and is to be an influence
positively in these kids' lives and to

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.080
help them avoid the negative influences.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.920
See, I just basically took a
little bit about what Timothy's

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.040
call is and place it over Josh's
life based upon what I've seen.

00:18:29.804 --> 00:18:32.385
I think that's really cool when I
started thinking about that and that

00:18:32.385 --> 00:18:34.814
just, again, you're not the only
person I think of, but that was just

00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:35.594
something they just thought of me.

00:18:35.594 --> 00:18:37.455
And I think that's really cool
when we begin to think about like,

00:18:37.905 --> 00:18:39.584
the Bible does apply to our lives.

00:18:39.584 --> 00:18:42.405
It doesn't just apply to
Timothy's life and it's just, oh,

00:18:42.405 --> 00:18:43.635
that's what that was for them.

00:18:43.784 --> 00:18:44.955
It applies to all of our lives.

00:18:44.955 --> 00:18:46.935
And so you guys could probably
take that same thing right?

00:18:46.935 --> 00:18:50.084
Where you have a passion for
something to make a change.

00:18:50.475 --> 00:18:54.554
And as you begin to apply that you begin
to give your personal experiences, right?

00:18:54.554 --> 00:18:55.605
So you're teaching truth.

00:18:55.754 --> 00:18:57.465
You're giving personal
experiences, testimony.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.890
And you're consistently pointing
people away from the Baltz teachings

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.990
or the faults waste to live.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.150
That's all that we're talking about here.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.390
And I just saw that all come together
and I think it's just encouraging

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:10.500
to know this applies to us.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:10.710
Right?

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.190
So Timothy, in this short verse,
right in the short part of this verse

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.030
needed to be reminded that God had
prepared him and placed him right.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.650
Where he needed to be to fill this call.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.340
So now that Paul has told Timothy
why he gave him this charge, right.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.720
Based upon his previously
calling that was placed upon him.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.140
He now tells him where the power
to fill his call come from.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.430
And you're going to be
amazed with this, right?

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:37.650
Where's the power come to fulfill his
calm, the power comes from fulfill or

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.450
something from remembering his calling.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.740
And so we'll see this rest of the verse.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.490
I'm going to read it all.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:46.110
He says, Timothy, my son, I'm giving
you this instruction and keeping

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:50.370
with the prophecies previously
made about you so that by recalling

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.830
them, you may fight the good fight.

00:19:54.385 --> 00:19:59.725
So by recalling the prophecies
made about you and the instruction

00:19:59.725 --> 00:20:03.715
given to you, you may have the
power to fight the good fight.

00:20:04.795 --> 00:20:07.555
There is power and remembering your call.

00:20:07.915 --> 00:20:10.015
There is power in remembering your call.

00:20:10.015 --> 00:20:10.495
Why?

00:20:11.245 --> 00:20:13.435
Because God's the one that
placed that call in your life.

00:20:13.945 --> 00:20:17.725
And if God placed that call on
your life, he will see it through.

00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:22.200
So whenever you're discouraged, Whenever
you're struggling when you're ever

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.060
you're wondering if it will ever happen.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.070
How can I ever do this, this task?

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.770
Go back to what I asked at the
beginning of this task is too big.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.510
God, if you don't show up, that's
you remembering that if God placed

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:38.010
you here, God will give you the
ability to bring it through.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.550
And that's what Paul
was reminding Timothy.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.870
And so I started thinking
through this, right?

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.540
When life gets tough, we
have to remember our why.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.560
That's what I think about that, that.

00:20:47.925 --> 00:20:49.005
Behind our callings.

00:20:49.425 --> 00:20:52.485
And I started thinking through
three things in my life of reasons,

00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:55.305
why, and that helped me get through
some of the struggles of my life

00:20:55.305 --> 00:20:56.445
or some difficult situations.

00:20:56.445 --> 00:21:00.975
Number one, um, whenever I went
into college, I was not very smart.

00:21:00.975 --> 00:21:02.805
Just so you guys know
I was not very smart.

00:21:02.805 --> 00:21:04.335
I was behind on a lot of things.

00:21:04.785 --> 00:21:07.995
Um, but I was determined my
why and finishing college

00:21:08.025 --> 00:21:09.315
was to provide for my family.

00:21:09.795 --> 00:21:11.595
Um, and so I made it through
four years of college.

00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:11.895
I don't know.

00:21:12.915 --> 00:21:14.595
I was not good at writing papers.

00:21:14.805 --> 00:21:17.295
I was not good at a lot of things,
but I made it through college,

00:21:17.295 --> 00:21:18.915
a four-year degree and I got it.

00:21:18.915 --> 00:21:22.815
But my why is what got me
through my remembering, right?

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:25.785
My why got me through, through college.

00:21:26.415 --> 00:21:27.225
What about marriage?

00:21:27.255 --> 00:21:28.665
What happens when marriage gets tough?

00:21:28.695 --> 00:21:29.085
Right.

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:32.535
I remember my why, because
at that day I committed to my

00:21:32.535 --> 00:21:34.215
wife in sickness and in health.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.380
Right or richer or sometimes poor.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:37.680
Right?

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.340
Sometimes.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:43.620
So you guys know just a funny thing in the
middle of middle of our Val exchange, um,

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:48.150
Brittany started crying on that part and
she said for richer or poor, and it was

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.690
hilarious because it's like, she didn't
mean to do that, but people were laughing.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:55.350
So I think if I get poor, I'm a little
bit questionable on whether our marriage,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:01.260
but, but we remember our why when marriage
gets tough, because here's what my

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.640
challenge is when I started writing this.

00:22:04.169 --> 00:22:09.570
Because moments of struggle, don't
outweigh lifetimes of good y'all

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:13.679
know this majority of our marriages,
if you've been married for a

00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:16.050
while, have a lot of good moments.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.710
But the moments that typically
divide us are the small moments

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.169
where are insignificant.

00:22:22.169 --> 00:22:23.760
When you look at the whole picture of the.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:29.520
So my why, my remembering, why I
married my wife and why I still

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.620
love her to the end of this day.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.470
Is that not the small
things that annoy me?

00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:36.300
And so my why is important.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.629
So then I started even thinking about
this, my why behind starting this

00:22:39.629 --> 00:22:41.879
church, and I keep going back to this.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.210
Do you know how easy it would have been
to give up planting this church two years?

00:22:46.215 --> 00:22:49.455
In the middle of a pandemic, when we
wonder what the heck God you're doing.

00:22:49.745 --> 00:22:52.965
And you would be surprised that
even there's wise, you know,

00:22:52.965 --> 00:22:54.345
like why are we still doing this?

00:22:54.345 --> 00:22:56.685
Because it's two years,
it comes into my mind.

00:22:56.685 --> 00:23:02.295
But then I remember God called us.

00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:07.485
And if God called us, God will provide
in his timing with his resources and his

00:23:07.485 --> 00:23:11.625
people remembering our calling is power.

00:23:12.375 --> 00:23:14.115
That's what Paul was reminding Timothy.

00:23:14.355 --> 00:23:16.275
You have had prophecies made about you.

00:23:16.275 --> 00:23:17.265
I've invested in you.

00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:19.215
I believe in you don't give up.

00:23:20.055 --> 00:23:25.575
Don't give up and we need to remember
that because there's going to be some

00:23:25.575 --> 00:23:28.305
tough times in your life and your life.

00:23:28.485 --> 00:23:29.805
God, you've called me to this marriage.

00:23:29.835 --> 00:23:31.005
God, you've called me to the shop.

00:23:31.005 --> 00:23:32.475
God, you've called me to this church.

00:23:32.655 --> 00:23:35.265
God, you've called me to this moment
in my life and living my faith

00:23:35.265 --> 00:23:39.885
out of my job or wherever it's
going to be this moment of crisis.

00:23:41.209 --> 00:23:46.219
And you need to remember your war call
because if you remember your call by God

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:52.159
and you get a community around you that
encourages you in that call, you won't

00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:54.709
give up because that's what God uses.

00:23:54.709 --> 00:24:00.080
There is power and remembering our call
and that's exactly what Timothy was doing.

00:24:01.399 --> 00:24:07.264
So we need you to remember again, That he
had been given a call by God, encouraged

00:24:07.264 --> 00:24:09.875
important to by Paul and the profits.

00:24:10.175 --> 00:24:11.314
And it wasn't time to give up.

00:24:11.314 --> 00:24:11.794
And I love this.

00:24:11.794 --> 00:24:16.175
I know we're not even into second Timothy,
but second Timothy one six through seven.

00:24:16.175 --> 00:24:19.294
It's one of my, some of my favorite
verses it says this, this, this,

00:24:19.595 --> 00:24:23.375
uh, this is Paul speaking to
Timothy Timothy fan into flame.

00:24:23.375 --> 00:24:27.425
The gift that God has given you for God
has not given you a spirit of fear, but

00:24:27.425 --> 00:24:29.405
a power and love and sound judgment.

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:32.320
Paul wrote a letter to
first him in there first.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.040
I mean, he, he wrote one letter to
Timothy and he's encouraging Timothy

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:41.659
to remember his call, but Timothy still
needed encouragement in the second

00:24:41.659 --> 00:24:45.530
letter from Paul to say, fan into
flame, the gift that God has given you.

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.350
And you guys know what fanning into
flame is, and this is what I love.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:51.110
This is that they had this, uh,
small group on Wednesday night.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.510
We didn't end up getting to go to the
small group at Brock and Jenna's house.

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:57.250
Um, but there was what was
the log was not on fire.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:58.129
You give me the story.

00:24:58.129 --> 00:24:59.179
I'm going to have you shared this story.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.060
Absolutely.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.710
So what did Paul do?

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.520
Paul put the blocks back
together again for Timothy.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.500
And he said fan into flame.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.030
The gift that God's given you remember.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.580
And he says, God, and this is
what I love too many times.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.810
We remember all the things that
God gives us, but sometimes I

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.160
quote what God doesn't give us.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.550
Right.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.680
And this is where we talk about
addressing false teachers.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.000
God, doesn't give that to us.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.240
Right?

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.370
There are certain things that false
teachers tell us, no, God hasn't given

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:48.300
us that well, this is what I love quoting
that God doesn't give us a spirit of fear.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.030
He does not give us a spirit of fear,
but of love and some more stuff that

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.379
I just wrote down, power and sound.

00:25:58.294 --> 00:26:01.145
And so I have to remember that at
times, whenever fear comes into

00:26:01.145 --> 00:26:04.385
my life, Nope, God hasn't given
me that I'm not picking it up.

00:26:05.375 --> 00:26:06.064
I'm not picking it up.

00:26:06.334 --> 00:26:08.044
So there is power and remembering, right.

00:26:08.044 --> 00:26:11.165
There's power and remembering our
calling because it will give you

00:26:11.165 --> 00:26:13.685
again, the power and confidence in
the ability to fight the good fight.

00:26:13.715 --> 00:26:14.615
This is what I love here.

00:26:14.854 --> 00:26:18.814
He says, um, so that, you
know, by recalling that you

00:26:18.814 --> 00:26:19.865
may fight the good fight.

00:26:19.865 --> 00:26:23.794
Anybody ever fought a bad fight,
like when you shouldn't have got into

00:26:24.485 --> 00:26:25.625
and like, oh man, that's not worth.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.490
Anybody ever got in a fight by
the time you get done with it, you

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.139
forgot why you started the fight.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:37.590
That's fighting the wrong fight, but the
fight that Paul's challenging Timothy to

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.320
fight is the good fight, the good fight.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:46.139
It was a mining us in him that, that this
good fight that we're fighting is a battle

00:26:46.139 --> 00:26:48.570
that will bring so many things, right.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.419
Live change, salvation,
transforming power, and love.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.090
Unspeakable, joy, peace.

00:26:54.715 --> 00:26:55.885
Not only into our lives.

00:26:55.885 --> 00:26:57.054
This is the part where
I'm challenging you.

00:26:57.235 --> 00:27:02.635
The call on your life is not just for
you, but it's for those around you that

00:27:02.635 --> 00:27:04.375
have experienced those same things, right?

00:27:04.524 --> 00:27:06.985
These are the things we're
fighting for others to experience.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.850
In our city, our
neighborhoods in our homes.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:10.550
So I'm going to say it again.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.470
We're fighting this good fight.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.720
We're remembering our call.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.890
We're not backing down so that
others can experience live, change,

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:23.240
salvation, transforming power, and
love, unspeakable, joy, peace, hope

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.500
patients, relationships, encouragement.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:28.760
I'll tell you this guys.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.760
Why do I not give up when it gets tough?

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:36.620
Because I want someone else to experience
the relationship that I have with.

00:27:38.045 --> 00:27:42.995
I am so changed by what God's done for
me, that it drives me to continue to come

00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:45.935
here every week to continue to make phone
calls, to continue to go to people's

00:27:45.935 --> 00:27:50.675
houses, to continue to just listen and
to continue to love on people in the city

00:27:50.945 --> 00:27:52.625
now, because I want something from them.

00:27:52.835 --> 00:27:54.455
I want something for them.

00:27:55.115 --> 00:27:55.625
I'll say that again.

00:27:55.805 --> 00:27:58.595
I don't know the times I've
told teachers this judge.

00:27:58.605 --> 00:27:59.165
I think I've told you this.

00:27:59.285 --> 00:28:00.575
I don't want anything from you.

00:28:00.965 --> 00:28:01.955
I want something for you.

00:28:03.595 --> 00:28:07.525
Why because that's what
Jesus came to do to give.

00:28:08.785 --> 00:28:10.015
I want to be like Jesus.

00:28:10.615 --> 00:28:14.635
And so I have to remember over and over
again, whenever things are difficult.

00:28:15.145 --> 00:28:20.275
My why my calling God has called me here
to make a difference to change lives.

00:28:20.815 --> 00:28:22.795
And that's what he had to challenge
Timothy to do, because here's the

00:28:22.795 --> 00:28:27.295
thing Timothy's about to walk in to
some people that are intimidating.

00:28:28.135 --> 00:28:29.635
And I don't know about you
guys, anybody here are people.

00:28:30.915 --> 00:28:31.845
I struggle with that.

00:28:31.845 --> 00:28:35.865
Like, I want to make people happy,
but sometimes you still got to speak

00:28:35.865 --> 00:28:38.655
truth and not everybody's going
to like you and that's difficult.

00:28:39.705 --> 00:28:41.715
And so there's power
and remembering, right?

00:28:41.715 --> 00:28:45.495
Paul said to Timothy, remember your
call, write your why so that you

00:28:45.495 --> 00:28:48.945
may encourage an Ambien power to
not give up and continue to fight

00:28:48.975 --> 00:28:52.815
for what is good so that others can
experience what you've experienced.

00:28:53.745 --> 00:28:57.284
But then Paul tells Timothy, this,
this is how you should fight.

00:28:57.885 --> 00:29:00.675
So if you're going to go into a battle,
you're going to go into a fight.

00:29:01.094 --> 00:29:02.385
We're going to fight the good fight.

00:29:02.685 --> 00:29:04.485
How do you fight?

00:29:04.754 --> 00:29:07.635
And he shares two ways and
he says this in verse 19.

00:29:07.635 --> 00:29:11.504
And the first part of it, he says
having faith and a good conscience.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.740
What are those two things?

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.800
And I just started asking myself this
question, will those, those are good.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.460
What do they mean?

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:22.710
And so having faith, so to have,
is to, to put on or to hold close.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.770
And so I think of this, like to have
something like I have clothes on,

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.050
that's logical right there, close to me.

00:29:28.379 --> 00:29:29.310
I don't let it go.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:33.180
So having faith means we
keep what God has taught us.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.410
The truths that God has taught us.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.510
We keep them close to us.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:36.900
Right?

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.340
The conviction of the truth of Jesus.

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:45.260
But then we also have this where he talks
about, um, uh, this good conscience.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.280
And so when we think about a good
conscience, a conscience is the inner

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.690
voice that the soon distinguishes
between what is morally good and morally.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.680
And so a good conscience is more
than just proclaiming faith with our

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.210
lips and saying, I know what's right.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.150
So I'm going to proclaim this
truth, but it's saying not only

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:06.270
saying these right things, but it's
practicing these things as well.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.030
So these are two ways that
we fight to have that.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:10.680
Close to us.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:15.629
Our faith is what we believe God
for what we believe in God with.

00:30:15.659 --> 00:30:19.409
We keep that close to us, but
we also keep a good conscience.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.190
One that is a check in our spirit
of what is right and what is wrong.

00:30:23.399 --> 00:30:24.899
And we actually listened to it.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.810
And I, and I say this
to say, this I'm a warn.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:29.909
Whereas we actually shared
this story that made me just

00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:30.990
challenge with this statement.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:35.399
He said this, he said someone once
told him about his, their pastor.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.620
He said, my pastor is such a good point.

00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:41.625
He should never leave the pulpit,
but he's such a poor Christian.

00:30:41.625 --> 00:30:42.855
He should never get in the pulpit.

00:30:43.395 --> 00:30:46.605
Here's what he was saying
was sometimes our conscience.

00:30:47.265 --> 00:30:51.795
We know that what we're living is
wrong, but we, we want to be right.

00:30:51.795 --> 00:30:53.775
So we just share what's right.

00:30:53.805 --> 00:30:54.765
But we don't live.

00:30:55.215 --> 00:30:55.605
Right.

00:30:55.755 --> 00:31:01.515
So a good conscience is actually saying
and doing the right thing, not saying one

00:31:01.515 --> 00:31:03.405
thing and doing the other thing  know.

00:31:03.425 --> 00:31:06.845
No, this is, I remember as a kid,
my friend called me a hypocrite.

00:31:08.185 --> 00:31:08.995
And I didn't know what that meant.

00:31:08.995 --> 00:31:10.045
That was too big of a word for me.

00:31:10.045 --> 00:31:12.265
I'm like, no, I'm not, I
didn't know what it meant.

00:31:12.595 --> 00:31:13.105
Basically.

00:31:13.105 --> 00:31:14.815
It's saying one thing
and doing the opposite.

00:31:15.475 --> 00:31:18.745
And so that's what Paul's saying is like,
he's saying that, how do you win this

00:31:18.745 --> 00:31:22.285
battle is by having that faith and keeping
it close and keeping a good conscience.

00:31:22.675 --> 00:31:23.635
So I'll say it this way.

00:31:24.655 --> 00:31:27.835
Basically what Paul is telling Timothy
is the way to be successful at your

00:31:27.835 --> 00:31:31.345
calling is to believe that God believe
in God, with all your heart, with

00:31:31.345 --> 00:31:34.795
all your mind and with all your soul
and live a life that reflects that.

00:31:36.465 --> 00:31:39.255
And he's basically saying this
don't let the false teachers bully

00:31:39.255 --> 00:31:42.795
you into, outside of living your,
in your, inside your conviction.

00:31:42.805 --> 00:31:45.825
So Timothy is being approached
with false teaching.

00:31:45.825 --> 00:31:48.465
We already know Timothy is a little
bit timid because here's what

00:31:48.465 --> 00:31:50.685
Paul said is he said, don't leave.

00:31:51.045 --> 00:31:54.495
You know, if we remember back here in
verse three, Paul says, I urged you when

00:31:54.495 --> 00:31:56.595
I was in Macedonia to remain an emphasis.

00:31:57.075 --> 00:31:59.835
Timothy was already wanting to
kind of leave the situation.

00:32:00.735 --> 00:32:03.795
So Paul is saying, no,
no, don't, don't be.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.250
Don't leave.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.910
Number one, number two, these false
teachers don't give in because

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:09.960
what Timothy could have done.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.270
So we know a good conscience that
would have been a poor conscience.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:16.290
He would have said one thing, which
wouldn't have been truth, and he would

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.080
have lived a separate one because
of the false teachers influence.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:24.870
So Paul's saying don't do it,
match him up, say it, speak

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.150
truth and live with truth.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.260
Live with a good conscience.

00:32:29.465 --> 00:32:31.625
And again, we talked about that
idea behind people pleasing.

00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:36.304
And I think that's where Paul was getting
at is sometimes as Christians, we say

00:32:36.304 --> 00:32:39.665
the right things around our Christian,
Finn friends, and we live a separate

00:32:39.665 --> 00:32:43.774
way runner non-Christian friends,
because we don't have a good conscience.

00:32:43.774 --> 00:32:46.985
We don't have the ability to overcome
the people pleasing side of things.

00:32:47.195 --> 00:32:50.585
And so, you know, I struggle with those
same things that people pleasing and as

00:32:50.585 --> 00:32:54.965
the things I have to ask God to be bold
in my faith and to not give in on this.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.740
And so sometimes we catch
ourselves bypassing our

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.330
convictions to be accepted, right.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:03.240
We don't like controversy,
so we avoid it altogether.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.720
But we have to remember our calling,
which will empower us to live a life

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.880
reflective of our, of our inward faith.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.640
And so here's what happens.

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:14.400
This is the reason why Paul
says you need to go into these

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.290
battles with a good faith, right.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.450
Uh, having faith in a good company.

00:33:19.515 --> 00:33:22.815
And he says, the reason why is because
those who forget their calling, those

00:33:22.815 --> 00:33:25.035
who do not follow this wreck their faith.

00:33:25.035 --> 00:33:28.575
So what happens when we forget our
calling, it says this, he says some

00:33:28.575 --> 00:33:33.855
have rejected these, um, these and have
shipwrecked their faith among them are

00:33:33.855 --> 00:33:39.585
Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered
to Satan so that they may be taught not

00:33:39.585 --> 00:33:43.665
to blast him by the way your husband, I
think, went outside and the doors locked.

00:33:43.665 --> 00:33:44.535
So he may not give up.

00:33:45.925 --> 00:33:46.165
Okay.

00:33:46.195 --> 00:33:46.345
Good.

00:33:46.345 --> 00:33:47.455
Just want to make sure you knew that.

00:33:47.485 --> 00:33:47.814
Okay.

00:33:48.385 --> 00:33:53.274
Um, so he says this, sorry, that's a
off, no, I'm like processing things

00:33:53.274 --> 00:33:55.855
up here, so I just want to make sure
he doesn't get stuck on the cold.

00:33:56.335 --> 00:33:58.885
Um, so we ship wreck our faith, right?

00:33:58.885 --> 00:34:02.935
If we forget our calling, if
we forget our why our faith is

00:34:02.935 --> 00:34:04.824
shipwrecked, what does shipwreck mean?

00:34:05.274 --> 00:34:10.074
It means going off course or missing the
mark or it's causing a mess in her life.

00:34:10.495 --> 00:34:13.255
So how many all know being
shipwrecked would not be a good thing?

00:34:13.255 --> 00:34:13.915
If you were on a cruise.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.009
And you got shipwrecked, how
many all would be excited?

00:34:17.009 --> 00:34:17.489
Anybody.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.020
So it's not a good thing.

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:22.710
Although you may get a couple extra
days on the cruise ship and you may

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:26.850
like the music and whatever, but
eventually food's going to run out.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:30.000
So being stripped,
shipwrecked is not good.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:30.359
Right?

00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:33.750
So believers who shipwreck their faith
are the ones who forget they're called.

00:34:34.635 --> 00:34:34.905
Right.

00:34:34.935 --> 00:34:37.605
They forget their call, their
why, and they begin to sin

00:34:37.605 --> 00:34:38.505
against their conscience.

00:34:38.505 --> 00:34:38.715
Right.

00:34:38.715 --> 00:34:41.925
They begin to say, uh, even
though I think that's wrong,

00:34:41.955 --> 00:34:43.425
I'm just going to push past it.

00:34:43.425 --> 00:34:43.695
Right.

00:34:43.695 --> 00:34:46.935
They, they really go past their
moral compass that's in there.

00:34:47.565 --> 00:34:50.505
And we begin to realize that they begin
to believe, and this is where we start

00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:51.825
moving off into this false teaching.

00:34:51.825 --> 00:34:55.905
We begin to believe these things after
we live them consistently wrong, right.

00:34:55.905 --> 00:34:56.685
Going against our moral.

00:34:57.915 --> 00:35:02.235
And we begin to just have these wrong
beliefs and so wrong beliefs, usually stem

00:35:02.235 --> 00:35:07.455
from wrong living, which causes us to want
to hide our sin or justify it in some way.

00:35:07.515 --> 00:35:09.075
And so Paul is trying to protect Timothy.

00:35:09.615 --> 00:35:12.135
Don't become these people who
have shipwrecked their faith.

00:35:12.165 --> 00:35:13.215
It's not good.

00:35:13.665 --> 00:35:14.805
I don't want to be shipwrecked.

00:35:15.255 --> 00:35:16.815
And so warning sign, warning signs.

00:35:17.535 --> 00:35:19.695
And the only way you will not
ship wreck your faith is if

00:35:19.695 --> 00:35:21.495
you have that faith, right.

00:35:21.495 --> 00:35:25.215
And if you have that good conscience,
and if you remember your calling and

00:35:25.245 --> 00:35:27.165
all the prophecy spoke over you, right.

00:35:27.345 --> 00:35:29.505
And all the encouragement from
the community around you, you

00:35:29.505 --> 00:35:30.435
need to remember these things.

00:35:30.435 --> 00:35:34.515
You need to hold tight and fast to your
faith so that you do not ship wreck it.

00:35:35.595 --> 00:35:37.425
And so he ends up
pointing out a couple of.

00:35:38.725 --> 00:35:41.845
Um, and you know, he points out a couple
of these people, and this is the reason

00:35:41.845 --> 00:35:45.835
why I think about this is this not to
dislike, be a jerk and like post some

00:35:45.835 --> 00:35:49.405
names up here of people each week that
are, you know, shipwrecking their faith.

00:35:49.945 --> 00:35:53.035
He's doing it because he's wanting
Timothy to be aware of who it is.

00:35:53.035 --> 00:35:55.045
But there there's a reason behind,
I'm gonna kinda mention this

00:35:55.315 --> 00:35:57.865
number one shipwreck in your
faith doesn't happen overnight.

00:35:57.955 --> 00:36:03.985
Anybody ever been to the beach, anybody,
anybody ever set up their tent, put

00:36:03.985 --> 00:36:05.215
their stuff down, went and played.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.120
Five minutes later, you look up
and you can't find your stuff.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.940
All of a sudden out of nowhere,
you didn't even feel it.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:13.900
You didn't even see it.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:17.080
You begin to drift down the
beach, see shipwreck and your

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.190
faith doesn't happen overnight.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.780
It happens one wrong decision at a
time, one justified decision at a time.

00:36:23.944 --> 00:36:27.755
One, you know, area of your life that
you don't have accountability in.

00:36:27.755 --> 00:36:30.785
And all of a sudden you drift down
the way and you begin to justify

00:36:30.785 --> 00:36:33.935
and justify and justify an all of a
sudden you've shipwrecked your faith.

00:36:34.685 --> 00:36:37.565
So Paul saying like, don't
even get to that point where

00:36:37.565 --> 00:36:39.305
you're drifting, hold strong.

00:36:40.205 --> 00:36:43.805
But as we begin to think about
this, he mentions these two

00:36:43.805 --> 00:36:45.335
guys and I love these names.

00:36:45.335 --> 00:36:46.985
Hymenaeus I'm going to name my next child.

00:36:47.924 --> 00:36:49.634
And Alexander, right.

00:36:49.725 --> 00:36:51.134
And he says I've delivered them to Satan.

00:36:51.134 --> 00:36:52.305
That sounds so horrible.

00:36:52.575 --> 00:36:53.835
Let me break this down for you.

00:36:53.835 --> 00:36:55.875
So I began to look at it and
I'm like, man, I would hate

00:36:55.875 --> 00:36:56.654
to be delivered to Satan.

00:36:56.654 --> 00:36:57.225
Anybody else?

00:36:57.455 --> 00:36:58.634
That sounds really bad.

00:36:59.055 --> 00:37:02.924
Well, if you know enough about Paul Paul
actually taught on church discipline.

00:37:03.194 --> 00:37:05.265
And so I get an opportunity to talk
about what church discipline is.

00:37:05.265 --> 00:37:07.365
You'll hear that in a
negative context than church.

00:37:07.665 --> 00:37:10.185
Well, there, we have to do
church discipline today.

00:37:10.755 --> 00:37:13.605
Well, that's not something one that
anybody wants to do, but church discipline

00:37:13.605 --> 00:37:14.924
is actually all about restaurants.

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:16.320
Right.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.060
So it's somebody that's within the church
that is living contrary to the gospel.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:21.570
Right.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.490
And there's a way to handle it.

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.280
So here's how Paul's taught us to
handle this is if you see somebody

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.610
that is living contrary to the
gospel, that's in the church, you

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:31.110
go to them individually, right?

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:32.130
You're not bringing it before the church.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.110
You go to them individually and
you talk to them and you say, Hey,

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.610
I'm just, there's a little area.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:35.820
Again.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.650
You had a good relationship cause
you're in the church, right?

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:38.460
Hey, there's an error.

00:37:39.375 --> 00:37:41.715
Um, I would say there's
maybe something wrong here.

00:37:41.715 --> 00:37:42.405
Let's talk through this.

00:37:42.405 --> 00:37:45.495
How can I help if that doesn't
work, where they don't want to

00:37:45.525 --> 00:37:48.375
repent and turn from it, they don't
believe that you bring two or three

00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:50.055
friends with you go to that person.

00:37:50.055 --> 00:37:52.755
You sit down with them and you talk
about, Hey, there's an area of your life

00:37:52.755 --> 00:37:54.435
that is not lining up with the gospel.

00:37:54.435 --> 00:37:55.965
And we really concerned, how can we help?

00:37:55.965 --> 00:37:56.715
We want to be there.

00:37:56.955 --> 00:37:59.175
And if that person doesn't
see it doesn't want to repent.

00:37:59.205 --> 00:38:00.825
Then typically you bring
them before the whole church.

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.350
And then the whole church says,
Hey, we love you too much to

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:05.580
let you continue on sending.

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:09.690
And if that doesn't work, which
means this person says, I don't,

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.160
I want to continue on incenting.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.500
I want to continue on
shipwrecking my faith.

00:38:13.529 --> 00:38:14.550
Here's what the church does.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.830
Then you're going to have
to do that somewhere else.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.590
Why here's the question I
want to ask you this question.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.640
Why would you ever ask somebody to leave
the church after those three things?

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.250
Because don't, we want to keep
them around to love on them.

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:29.340
If you keep them around,
what are they going to.

00:38:31.345 --> 00:38:32.215
Somebody answered this for me.

00:38:32.275 --> 00:38:33.355
I haven't asked enough questions today.

00:38:33.805 --> 00:38:37.495
If you keep somebody around the shipwreck,
their faith, that you've done, all these

00:38:37.495 --> 00:38:38.905
things to help them restore their faith.

00:38:39.565 --> 00:38:40.405
What are they doing?

00:38:42.165 --> 00:38:43.185
Influencing others.

00:38:43.245 --> 00:38:45.045
What were these false
teachers being accused of?

00:38:45.225 --> 00:38:47.715
They were drawing people away from the.

00:38:48.944 --> 00:38:51.464
He even mentioned this at the end,
he says that they were blaspheming,

00:38:51.464 --> 00:38:54.225
which means they were rejecting
Christ and they were pushing the law.

00:38:54.404 --> 00:38:58.544
So imagine somebody in this church come
into church after I get him preaching,

00:38:58.725 --> 00:39:02.685
walking around to all y'all trying to say,
Christ is in the way, go back to the law.

00:39:03.855 --> 00:39:06.165
Well, again, we're thinking
about church discipline.

00:39:06.524 --> 00:39:09.254
If that ever happened individually,
somebody would go to them.

00:39:09.645 --> 00:39:10.785
The new would bring a couple people.

00:39:10.814 --> 00:39:12.825
So there will be a process of
trying to restore this person.

00:39:12.825 --> 00:39:13.785
Hey, that's not okay.

00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:15.725
And you know, you're not sitting
here trying to ring them out.

00:39:15.734 --> 00:39:17.115
You're also not trying
to give up on it, but.

00:39:18.075 --> 00:39:20.234
Leaving them in the church is hurting.

00:39:20.234 --> 00:39:21.615
The church has drawn
people away from the faith.

00:39:21.615 --> 00:39:24.884
So you're hoping by moving them
away from the community, that

00:39:24.884 --> 00:39:27.015
does show that support that Satan.

00:39:27.015 --> 00:39:28.785
Again, we say Satan, but really
when you get them away from the

00:39:28.785 --> 00:39:32.025
church, it's really allowing them to
understand they're missing something.

00:39:32.355 --> 00:39:35.325
Your hope is that that they will
come back and say, you know what?

00:39:35.325 --> 00:39:35.984
I was wrong.

00:39:36.015 --> 00:39:37.095
I missed this community.

00:39:37.275 --> 00:39:39.525
I missed the people that were
wanting to help and encourage me.

00:39:40.395 --> 00:39:43.484
So I say all that to say, Paul was
not saying, Hey, I hope you got.

00:39:44.205 --> 00:39:45.915
So, you know that that's not his goal.

00:39:46.215 --> 00:39:49.305
His hope is that as you look
at this as this, so they may

00:39:49.305 --> 00:39:51.225
be taught not to blaspheme.

00:39:52.275 --> 00:39:55.935
His hope is there's a lesson and
kicking them out of the church.

00:39:57.405 --> 00:40:01.515
And so I looked at this originally going,
man, I don't like this, but I started

00:40:01.515 --> 00:40:06.765
realizing, you know, and again, I go
back to being a principal is not fun.

00:40:06.765 --> 00:40:08.415
When you have to kick a kid
out of school for a couple.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.190
Why because they're not getting it there.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:13.589
They're treating teachers wrong or
they're, they're beating up students

00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:16.860
and, and you're going, man, wouldn't it
be better if they were in school, will

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.000
know they're not going to learn a lesson.

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.220
So your goal is that
there's a lesson in this.

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.720
And that was Paul's thing is saying this.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:26.130
We see two people who miss the mark
through restoration and falling off the

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:27.810
wagon and shipwreck and their faith.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.170
Timothy, I don't want
you to experience that.

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:32.640
Remember your call?

00:40:33.585 --> 00:40:33.975
Timothy.

00:40:33.975 --> 00:40:38.714
I don't want anybody else in the church to
experience that preach about remembering

00:40:38.714 --> 00:40:49.064
the call, clean to pure faith, a faith,
having faith clean to these things, right.

00:40:49.064 --> 00:40:51.585
A good conscience so that you
may not ship wreck your faith.

00:40:51.794 --> 00:40:54.674
These are all warnings
to us as a church, right?

00:40:55.455 --> 00:40:57.495
Not that these two guys are
just the enemy because they're

00:40:57.495 --> 00:40:59.174
not, they were in the church.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:04.990
These two people are dearly
loved church members that Paul's

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:06.100
saying I want to do anything.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:09.970
I can, that they will be taught
not to blast fame, reject Christ.

00:41:10.509 --> 00:41:12.129
He's actually wanting to restore them.

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.529
So this teaches all of us today.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.640
As we look at this right,
a lesson, we all agree.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.350
We don't want to be
shipwrecked in our faith.

00:41:20.859 --> 00:41:21.250
Amen.

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:22.810
I mean, I hope you don't after all.

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:26.190
If you do, I need to re preach
the message, but you don't want

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.210
to be shipwrecked in your faith.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.850
Well, how do we not
shipwrecked in our faith?

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.900
Remember our call.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:34.260
That's how I want you to
just remember our call.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:40.980
God has sent his son Jesus to
this earth so that everybody,

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.810
everybody may know that.

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:45.570
Number one, just so you know,
the number one call in your life

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:46.500
has have a personal relationship.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.100
And out of the overflow of that personal
relationship, you go live out your

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:57.350
life, wherever God's placed you in
your job, your home, your activities.

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:02.840
And you begin to share the hope of the
gospel with other people so that they

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.490
may experience a personal issue with God.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:06.560
That's the simplicity of
the call in our lives.

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:11.810
So as Paul closes this first chapter
in Timothy, he felt the need to

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:13.310
remind Timothy of his call, right?

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:16.340
In order to give him confidence
and following the instruction that

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:19.700
Paul had given him, he was telling
Timothy there's power in your calling

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.280
to encourage you to fulfill the
things God has prepared you to do.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.670
And the same text is encouraging
us in those same things.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:33.800
To remember our call in our lives, to
give us a clear conscience and faith

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.140
to win the battle to not ship record.

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:42.965
Because on the other side of shipwreck
is separation where none of us

00:42:42.965 --> 00:42:45.275
want to be right from the church.

00:42:46.625 --> 00:42:49.925
And so as we go into limitation, I'm just
going to kind of quickly lead into this.

00:42:51.509 --> 00:42:55.620
I'm hoping my hope is that through this
message and kind of summarize in the first

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:59.940
chapter that you all are kind of learning
a little bit more of the importance,

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:03.930
one of God's word, but also why I asked
this question, Lord, why did you lead

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:06.000
us to get in the book of first Timothy?

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.930
I believe that God is preparing
all of us as we continue to move

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:14.220
forward in our faith, um, to
clean to the truths of the gospel.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.049
And, and I'm always challenging.

00:43:17.145 --> 00:43:25.035
Timothy would have no clue what the truths
of the gospel were without knowing Jesus

00:43:25.425 --> 00:43:28.665
and without knowing him in a daily walk.

00:43:28.785 --> 00:43:29.955
And I was taught that daily walk.

00:43:29.955 --> 00:43:30.705
What does that mean?

00:43:31.065 --> 00:43:33.785
It means the greatest way to get to
know God is subsequent time with him.

00:43:35.115 --> 00:43:37.485
And to study it just like we're
setting it here just to walk

00:43:37.485 --> 00:43:40.395
through it and look at things and
practically apply them in our life.

00:43:40.845 --> 00:43:43.995
The only way that we'll get to know
Jesus more is not only learning these

00:43:43.995 --> 00:43:46.875
things, but beginning to apply them
to our lives and living them out.

00:43:47.595 --> 00:43:50.745
So what Timothy is teaching us
what Paul is teaching us is this,

00:43:51.105 --> 00:43:52.275
that in order to be able to read.

00:43:53.605 --> 00:43:57.115
False lies to be able to reject the
things that the false teachers are

00:43:57.115 --> 00:44:00.475
teaching in our world that are trying
to pull us away from who Christ is.

00:44:00.475 --> 00:44:03.085
And the pull us away from what we
talk about, these false teachers,

00:44:03.085 --> 00:44:07.045
they were trying to create anger and
dissension and disunity Christ is

00:44:07.045 --> 00:44:12.265
trying to teach us love and hope and
joy and unity and family and community.

00:44:12.924 --> 00:44:15.955
So we need to reject those things
by knowing Jesus more greatest way.

00:44:15.955 --> 00:44:18.535
You can know Jesus more so that
personal issue, the second way you

00:44:18.535 --> 00:44:20.455
can know Jesus more is doing life.

00:44:21.839 --> 00:44:22.680
Doing life with one another.

00:44:23.129 --> 00:44:26.040
So I I've challenged you before
and I'll continue to challenge you.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:30.149
If you're not part of a group during the
week, we have two groups currently that

00:44:30.149 --> 00:44:33.060
meet once a week called inspire groups.

00:44:33.209 --> 00:44:37.500
The goal is to build more community,
which means we, we usually meet once

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.350
a month, we eat a meal, we hang out,
we talk, we get to know each other.

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.439
We take the message that we,
we talked about on Sunday.

00:44:43.439 --> 00:44:45.480
And we sit around in a circle
and we say, Hey, what does this

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.129
look like to follow in your life?

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:50.160
And I'm not the only one talking
by the way, actually all y'all.

00:44:51.075 --> 00:44:53.384
And it's an opportunity to just say,
Hey, how does this apply to your life?

00:44:53.384 --> 00:44:54.285
And what's this look like here?

00:44:54.285 --> 00:44:56.115
And we encourage one another
and we pray for one another

00:44:56.265 --> 00:44:57.555
and we build each other up.

00:44:58.245 --> 00:44:58.455
Right?

00:44:58.455 --> 00:45:02.745
And so that's another way to follow
Christ to grow your relationship,

00:45:02.805 --> 00:45:06.435
to help you not shipwreck your face.

00:45:07.575 --> 00:45:09.105
And there's more to that, right?

00:45:09.165 --> 00:45:10.815
As we continue to grow in our community.

00:45:11.595 --> 00:45:16.065
So today during our invitation, invitation
is always an opportunity to say, God,

00:45:16.065 --> 00:45:17.445
I heard something from your word.

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:19.110
Lord applied to my life.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.800
It's an opportunity for you to
just close your eyes and just pray.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.280
And if you don't know how to pray, do you
know praying is just as simple as talking

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.390
to a friend, cause God is that close.

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:34.650
And so you can just pray and say,
Lord, whatever you spoke to me this

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:36.630
morning, Lord, help me cling to it.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.460
And for some of you that could just
be, I need to give my life to you.

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:44.070
Maybe you just need to
give your life to Jesus.

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.320
And if that's you, please come to us.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.190
Th that's something we celebrate,
you know, that the Bible says

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:53.430
that there is angels in heaven
that are throwing a party.

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:57.030
Basically they're celebrating over
one sinner who repents one sinner

00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:59.340
in that cool angels in heaven.

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:00.450
I want to be a part of that party.

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.090
And I remember the Sunday night that
I gave my life to Christ and until

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.060
my pastor, and that was the, well, my
pastor told me, I'm like really cool.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.430
Like, I didn't know, God
cared about me that much.

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.280
And I began to learn over the years
that God cares more than even that.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.100
So maybe today's the day for
you to give your life to Christ.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.140
And if it is please come talk.

00:46:17.279 --> 00:46:18.690
We celebrate those things.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.560
Um, and we'll have a conversation,
maybe it's for you to just

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.820
get your life back on track.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.500
Maybe you have been drifting.

00:46:25.799 --> 00:46:29.880
You haven't shipwreck your faith
yet, but it's getting there and

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.080
you're going to get out of the water.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.700
You're gonna move back up the beach
and you're going to get back in, right?

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:36.360
Maybe that's you.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:38.190
So today, you know what that's called?

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:39.210
It's called repentance Lord.

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:39.750
Forgive me.

00:46:39.779 --> 00:46:41.310
Lord helped me overcome the.

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.780
And if you need to pray with me just to
kind of help you walk through that, I'm

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:46.710
going to walk through that with you.

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:48.660
If you're trying to figure out
how to get out of the water, I

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.160
can pull you out of the water.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.150
I can walk alongside you.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:53.070
There's other people in this room
that want to walk alongside you to

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:55.080
help you get back to your place.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.640
That's why we're here.

00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:58.710
I don't know if that's where it is.

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:00.450
And I don't know if maybe you're
listening to this message going.

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:01.110
Amen.

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:02.640
And you're just telling the Lord amen.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.090
And your prayer.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:03.510
I don't know.

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:04.500
That's that's between you and.

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:07.650
But if there's any way that I can
help you any way that I can talk

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:08.520
to you about a relationship, Jesus.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.350
Anyway, I can help you get
to connect to the community.

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:15.270
Please, please, please come talk
to me because I can't wait to share

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:19.440
with you until to walk alongside
whatever God's leading you to do.

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.930
But my challenge, my
last statement I'm done.

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:22.710
I promise I'm done.

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:27.450
The last thing that you may be asking
you heard today is man, there's power

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:30.990
my calling, but I'm still trying to
figure out what my calling my purpose is.

00:47:32.735 --> 00:47:33.125
Great.

00:47:33.425 --> 00:47:36.695
We're all walking in the season,
still trying to figure that out.

00:47:37.445 --> 00:47:41.015
That's another thing that I would love
to talk to you about, because then we'll

00:47:41.015 --> 00:47:45.185
start putting pieces together about where
God's placed you and how God's gifted you.

00:47:45.575 --> 00:47:48.875
And we'll begin to discover
your purpose to help other

00:47:48.875 --> 00:47:50.795
people discover hope in Jesus.

00:47:51.365 --> 00:47:51.665
Amen.

00:47:52.505 --> 00:47:56.825
So we're going to pray and after we
pray, um, Matt's gonna play soccer

00:47:56.825 --> 00:47:59.465
for a little bit for you guys to
just process that with God and ask

00:47:59.465 --> 00:48:00.845
God how you can take your next.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.550
I'll be back there in the back.

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:06.120
Come talk to me and then we'll end
our day, um, worshiping together.

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:06.779
Amen.

00:48:07.529 --> 00:48:07.740
All right.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.670
Let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:09.330
We thank you Lord.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:09.720
For today.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.920
We thank you for this message.

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:16.800
Lord, just to remind each one of us, how
important remembering our call is Lord,

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.450
because there is power in our calling.

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.529
Lord.

00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:22.020
If there's a person in this room,
that's struggling to even know.

00:48:22.815 --> 00:48:26.565
What it is to have a calling, or maybe
it's through a personal relationship

00:48:26.565 --> 00:48:28.665
with you, Lord, I pray that they
come and talk to me and they say,

00:48:28.665 --> 00:48:31.305
Hey, I just have questions about
what it means to give my life to you.

00:48:32.145 --> 00:48:34.395
And so Lord, I pray that that
person takes that step Lord.

00:48:34.395 --> 00:48:37.035
I pray if there's a person in this
room or multiple people in this room

00:48:37.035 --> 00:48:41.025
that are just saying, Hey, I want to
know more about my call, my call to

00:48:41.025 --> 00:48:45.015
follow you or to call to live their
lives out for you Lord somewhere.

00:48:45.134 --> 00:48:46.095
I just pray that they come back.

00:48:46.095 --> 00:48:50.415
And again, just, just ask for guidance
and Lord I'll just continue to point

00:48:50.415 --> 00:48:51.845
them to your word and walk alongside.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:55.470
The Lord, whatever you're challenging
each person in this room to do, Lord,

00:48:55.470 --> 00:49:00.150
I pray that you, you, you caused
them to choose today because too

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:04.380
many times, Lord, I think we, we say,
well, next week and the next week

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:05.610
comes and we'll say, well, next week.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.350
But Lord today is the day of salvation.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:11.040
Today is the day to take
the next right step Lord.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:14.580
That next right step will
produce huge results.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:20.550
Every time that we take step after
step, because God, you have exceedingly

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:21.780
abundantly more than we can ask.

00:49:24.075 --> 00:49:27.345
And so Lord, I just pray that
you do what you do, Lord.

00:49:27.675 --> 00:49:30.495
I don't even need to pray anymore
because you know, as the Lord, I

00:49:30.495 --> 00:49:31.575
just pray this in your heavenly name.

00:49:32.325 --> 00:49:32.625
Amen.

00:49:33.135 --> 00:49:33.585
Amen.
