00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.630
And inspiring hope.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.660
I hope you guys have had an amazing week.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.860
Um, we were talking
earlier, it was a blur.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:11.700
That's what Brittany mentioned.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.450
Somebody says, How was your week?

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.170
She's like, I don't know.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.770
It was a blur.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.030
So maybe for you it was a blur.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.780
Maybe it was a great week.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.700
Maybe it was a slow week, but excited
that you guys have, uh, decided to come

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.620
and worship with us and spend some time.

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:26.744
Um, getting into God's word
because we know that God's

00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:29.055
word never returns void, right?

00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:31.005
God's word never returns void.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.305
I have to remind myself that every time,
and that's why my challenge to you,

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:39.455
if you've got five minutes every day,
even if minimum of five minutes, right?

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:42.075
Obviously go more if
you can get in the word.

00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:44.595
Because when you get in the word,
the word gets into your heart and

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:46.965
then gets into your life and then
comes outta your life, right?

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:49.425
And then the more that we enjoy
the word, the more that we learn.

00:00:49.425 --> 00:00:53.610
So, Today we're gonna
beat in Psalm one 50.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.620
Psalm one 50.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.580
Here's an easy one.

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.739
Go to the last page in your Bible
and it's the last Psalm in that.

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.679
So it's very, very easy
for you to find it.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:09.270
Um, so this is going to set up next week.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.060
So next week we are having a worship.

00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:15.134
Service, meaning a worship only service.

00:01:15.405 --> 00:01:19.125
Um, our family will be
traveling out, um, to St.

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:22.244
Louis to one of our church partners
that brings mission teams out

00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:23.774
here, supports us financially.

00:01:23.774 --> 00:01:26.804
They've invited us out to their
Global Missions conference to

00:01:26.804 --> 00:01:29.024
share an update about our church
and what God's doing here.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.040
And to be able to meet some
of their people and kind of

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.060
make some connections there.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.540
So in that you guys will have an
opportunity to worship together,

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.320
or worship team has got an amazing
day planned out from prayer to, to

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:41.760
worship, to reading of God's word.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.700
So I would say this, come
ready to participate in it.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.020
Um, my encouragement for you, if you
have young kids bring, if you, if

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.780
you know that hey, they're normally
in class, we won't have kids class.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.660
Um, bring something to lay out
on the ground, bring some toys,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.030
just, I mean that, Honestly,
I tell everybody this every.

00:01:57.795 --> 00:02:01.215
Every week, not just worship Sundays
every week, feel free to literally

00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:02.235
lay something down on the ground.

00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:05.354
Some toys in the middle of my
preaching or in the middle of music.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:06.435
This is family.

00:02:06.435 --> 00:02:09.854
So I think if you guys were at my
house, you would do the same thing.

00:02:10.155 --> 00:02:13.875
So this is God's house and God would
love for little kids to just kind of roll

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.465
around and play with toys as they need to.

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:20.204
So feel free to come, be just
involved in that worship Sunday.

00:02:20.475 --> 00:02:22.535
Um, but because of that,
we wanted to talk about.

00:02:22.965 --> 00:02:28.275
Worship this week and how, uh, the, the
word of God talks about what worship is.

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:31.575
And, um, I'm, I'm very,
very excited about that.

00:02:31.575 --> 00:02:33.885
And one of the things I just
wanna mention, just in this idea

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.454
of, of where our church is right
now, I believe that God is doing

00:02:37.454 --> 00:02:39.015
something unique in our church.

00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:42.195
And you may say you're looking
around going, Well, it is unique.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.799
Uniquely smaller right now because there's
some people out because they're sick.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.459
I would say that God's doing something
unique in each person in our group,

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.459
and I know I, I don't have a personal
connection with each one of you and

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.140
probably know what your day to day is.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.640
Uh, but as I continue to just talk
with, uh, see God moving in people's

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.850
lives, uh, be able to pray with him
and encourage them and just, just

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.940
see what God's doing in our city
and some of the, the opportunities

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.549
that we have, God is doing some.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.420
About what God isn't doing.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.470
Anybody ever get that way?

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.250
I, I, I love talking about what
God's not doing, rather than

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.210
celebrating what God's doing.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.520
So God is doing some
awesome, awesome things.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.960
Why?

00:03:29.745 --> 00:03:33.195
Is God not revealing to me like where
our next location's gonna be cuz

00:03:33.195 --> 00:03:34.484
we're looking for a new space right.

00:03:34.484 --> 00:03:37.575
To worship or, you know, why this isn't
happening, why that isn't happening?

00:03:37.575 --> 00:03:40.665
I, I've, I've come to the conclusion
and you may think this is funny that

00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:42.795
it's taking me this long, but usually
I have seasons where I come to the

00:03:42.795 --> 00:03:44.204
conclusion and then I forget it.

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:47.745
Um, the reason why God doesn't reveal
that to me, cuz it's none of my

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:50.234
concern, that's his, his concern.

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:55.875
My concern is what God has given us now
to begin to pour into and to minister.

00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:56.505
And if I'll look.

00:03:57.525 --> 00:04:01.275
Be amazed that all the opportunities
God has giving us to, to know

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:04.305
him and to make him known, to
know him, and to make him known.

00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:07.545
And so God is just really
challenging me in that, right?

00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:13.755
And so when I started thinking about today
about worship, I just wrote down this

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.495
statement, God has already done so much
in my life and in this church that if

00:04:18.495 --> 00:04:23.325
he didn't do one more thing, it would be
enough to praise him the rest of my life.

00:04:23.325 --> 00:04:23.805
I'm gonna say that.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.810
God has already done so much
in my life and in this church's

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.130
life that if he didn't do one
more thing, it would be enough to

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.750
praise him for the rest of my life.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.990
See, that's a challenging statement
to say because, you know, we, we

00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:45.910
all like more and I think at times
God's challenging us to, to stop

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.110
and praise him for what he has done.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.310
Right.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.090
Praise him for what he.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.160
Here's the thing that's so cool.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.180
If you read God's word and you
know God's heart, God's not done.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.600
Right?

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.530
We've been talking about this.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.940
We've actually got some shirts
that we're making talking

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.140
about God's not done with you.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.400
He's not done with me.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.720
He's not done with us.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.950
He's not done with this.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.700
What does that mean?

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.010
God's not done working
in any of our lives.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.180
So it's not that God's saying,
Hey, stay where you are.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.560
Don't move.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.690
What he's saying is, enjoy the journey.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.360
Don't forget what God has done for you.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.590
Celebrate where you.

00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:23.955
We know God desires to see more and
more people come to faith in Christ,

00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:26.745
to use you to change people's lives.

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.594
But that's not a burden for you to bear.

00:05:29.924 --> 00:05:30.614
That's his.

00:05:32.385 --> 00:05:35.174
But that doesn't discount that God
desires to do more and more in us.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.435
And so we get to worship through it.

00:05:36.435 --> 00:05:39.705
So we're gonna talk more and more
about that today and I love it.

00:05:39.734 --> 00:05:40.094
Right?

00:05:40.365 --> 00:05:44.804
So I kind of wanna set this up right as
we talk about worship and how we talk

00:05:44.804 --> 00:05:46.484
about Jesus' worthy of our worship.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.760
What is worship?

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.369
So I wanna start there because I'd
love to get some feedback from you.

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:53.520
If somebody was to walk up to you
and they say, Hey, what is worship?

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:54.840
How would you respond?

00:05:54.844 --> 00:05:55.590
What would be your answer?

00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:02.340
What is worship praising God?

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.119
What else?

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.159
What is worship singing?

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:10.950
Okay.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.729
What else?

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:15.840
Spending time with him.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.469
What else?

00:06:21.435 --> 00:06:22.125
Reading your Bible.

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:22.544
What else?

00:06:23.775 --> 00:06:24.555
Focusing on him.

00:06:24.645 --> 00:06:25.425
Anything else?

00:06:26.294 --> 00:06:26.895
Serving?

00:06:29.895 --> 00:06:32.325
See, there's many aspects of worship.

00:06:32.805 --> 00:06:33.344
Let's give you a few.

00:06:33.344 --> 00:06:36.195
I wrote down, and you guys were
obviously right, spot on, right?

00:06:36.585 --> 00:06:40.724
When we worship, we're doing it to
honor and show reverence to God, right?

00:06:40.724 --> 00:06:45.854
When we worship, we're giving our entire
self our thoughts and our emotions to.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:54.270
When we worship, it's in response
to what God has done will do in your

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.770
life and in the lives of those around.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.920
You.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.159
See, we live in a world that spends
a lot of time worshiping, right?

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.349
But we, we find that we also live in a
church culture where we spend a lot of

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:09.120
time worshiping other things than God.

00:07:09.765 --> 00:07:11.594
So let me just jump out there.

00:07:11.655 --> 00:07:15.315
Give a great example of something that
I dealt with in my life and not a great

00:07:15.315 --> 00:07:21.375
example of worship in a good way, but
a great example of what worship was.

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:23.835
So whenever I gave my life to
Christ, and Brit will remember

00:07:23.835 --> 00:07:24.914
this, we're a young family.

00:07:25.395 --> 00:07:27.344
Um, and I spent the
majority of my weekends.

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:28.755
Let me tell you what the majority
of my weekends look like.

00:07:28.755 --> 00:07:30.015
Saturday was college football.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.594
Ou I watched college football a day.

00:07:32.594 --> 00:07:35.054
Then it was Sunday morning,
it was NASCAR Sunday, a.

00:07:35.895 --> 00:07:37.215
And some NFL football.

00:07:37.275 --> 00:07:39.675
And then Monday night was
obviously an NFL football, and

00:07:39.675 --> 00:07:41.985
I like lived and died by sports.

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:45.315
I worshiped sports.

00:07:45.915 --> 00:07:47.805
It was high on my priority.

00:07:47.895 --> 00:07:49.545
I had emotional highs and lows.

00:07:49.755 --> 00:07:51.165
I screamed out loud.

00:07:51.165 --> 00:07:56.025
I celebrated, You know, I sometimes
bowed down because I was so

00:07:56.115 --> 00:07:58.065
frustrated, like you name it, right?

00:07:58.065 --> 00:08:00.105
I loved sports.

00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:01.455
It consumed me.

00:08:02.475 --> 00:08:05.475
When I gave my life to Christ,
God began to weed things out.

00:08:05.475 --> 00:08:09.225
And so, you know, I'm actually wearing
an OU shirt today, so go sinners, right?

00:08:09.675 --> 00:08:10.995
Channing's wearing a Dallas Cowboy shirt.

00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:16.695
So we love sports still, but in
the process of worshiping the Lord

00:08:16.695 --> 00:08:20.115
in my life, I began to realize
there was something different.

00:08:21.195 --> 00:08:24.945
See Saturdays, Sunday mornings,
which ended up being at church.

00:08:24.945 --> 00:08:26.175
Then whenever I get my life, my Christ.

00:08:26.235 --> 00:08:28.635
So I was missing some
things or Sunday afternoons.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:33.060
I tended to get more excited about
worshiping sports than I did about the

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.580
Lord, and I thought something's wrong.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.500
I'm missing something.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:37.860
Right?

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:45.870
And when I realized that man, Jesus
is worthy of our worship, that it

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.580
started changing in my life, right?

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:52.410
I could go to church on Sundays and
stand there with my hands in the pocket,

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.160
wondering why he's singing one more verse.

00:08:56.985 --> 00:08:58.425
The same verse over and over again.

00:08:58.425 --> 00:08:59.145
I just wanna sit down.

00:08:59.145 --> 00:08:59.835
My legs are hurting.

00:09:01.035 --> 00:09:04.275
When if I went to OU game,
you would never sit down and

00:09:04.275 --> 00:09:05.265
you would never stop cheering.

00:09:05.715 --> 00:09:06.405
That didn't bother me.

00:09:06.825 --> 00:09:10.545
I didn't say, Man, why don't the game
get less interesting so I can sit

00:09:10.545 --> 00:09:12.525
down on my seat and go home early?

00:09:12.735 --> 00:09:15.595
No, we wanted to go into overtime, right?

00:09:15.915 --> 00:09:18.975
So when I started thinking through
that, I started being convicted

00:09:19.155 --> 00:09:24.165
because I cared more and I celebrated
more When, when OU scored a touchdown

00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:25.545
than whenever Jesus changed my.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:32.280
See, I knew how to worship well, but I
was not worshiping the right thing, right?

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.449
So something had to change.

00:09:33.449 --> 00:09:36.720
And so my heart began to grow,
grow stronger with the Lord

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.790
and my emotional rollercoaster.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.540
And Brittney owes this.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.449
If OU lost on a Saturday,
I was mad for three days.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.370
I was mad.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.510
I was grumpy.

00:09:45.569 --> 00:09:47.280
And I mean, that's stupid guys.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.270
It's stupid.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:49.590
But that was me.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.449
So that began to change.

00:09:51.449 --> 00:09:54.390
And so now, I can watch,
literally, Brittney knows this.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.500
I can watch it or not watch it.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.030
You gave my love to, I
watched somebody yesterday.

00:09:57.209 --> 00:09:59.280
It was half time, we didn't get
to watch half the game yesterday.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.130
I didn't cried, didn't
complain, didn't matter.

00:10:02.189 --> 00:10:05.760
And if they would've lost yesterday
to Nebraska, I wouldn't have cared.

00:10:05.819 --> 00:10:06.510
I could have slept.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:07.830
But in the past I couldn't.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:08.520
Why?

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.320
Because my heart changed.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.860
Because I cared more about my worship
to the Lord and, and my relationship

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.650
with the Lord, and my relationship
with my family and, and who Christ was

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.090
in my life than I was about sports.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.840
And that's again, a great example of
what worship is, but in the wrong way.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.890
Why do I bring this up?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.750
Because we all worship something,
whether we know it or not.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.230
You begin to place things in our
lives, and I hope, and I pray

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.204
that it's God in your life, but
for some of us, It's our family.

00:10:35.265 --> 00:10:36.435
For some of us, it's our job.

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:38.564
For some of us, it's our work.

00:10:38.685 --> 00:10:42.494
For some of us, it's,
you know, sports or food.

00:10:42.944 --> 00:10:44.505
You name it, you place it in.

00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:45.074
What'd you say?

00:10:45.194 --> 00:10:50.474
Kids, We worship them so much that we
focus so much on them, that we take out

00:10:50.479 --> 00:10:53.175
the opportunity for worship, for God.

00:10:54.074 --> 00:10:57.375
I hope today that you'll learn a little
bit more as I did and as I jumped into

00:10:57.375 --> 00:11:02.275
the Psalm, Psalm one 50 of how the
psalmist challenges us to worship.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.439
I hope that you worship differently
because of what you'll learn today.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:08.640
So let's look at this.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.020
Psalm one 15.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.819
If you found your place, say amen.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.800
All right, awesome.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.340
Let's go.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.470
So it says this, Hallelujah.

00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:18.510
Praise God in his sanctuary.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.490
Praise him in his mighty expanse.

00:11:20.495 --> 00:11:22.780
Praise him for his powerful acts.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.620
Praise him for his abundant.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.780
Great, great.

00:11:26.565 --> 00:11:28.215
Praise him with the trumpet blast.

00:11:28.515 --> 00:11:30.105
Praise him with the harp and allier.

00:11:30.525 --> 00:11:32.505
Praise him with the tambourine and dance.

00:11:32.745 --> 00:11:34.395
Praise him with strings and flute.

00:11:34.845 --> 00:11:36.675
Praise him with resounding symbols.

00:11:36.885 --> 00:11:38.835
Praise him with clashing symbols.

00:11:39.555 --> 00:11:43.275
Let everything that
breathes praise the Lord.

00:11:43.695 --> 00:11:44.295
Hallelujah.

00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:45.375
Let's pray.

00:11:45.435 --> 00:11:48.555
Lord Jesus, we pray that your
word will not return void today,

00:11:48.615 --> 00:11:52.245
and that will be changed and
transformed into more and more like.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.580
Where our hearts are worshiping
you and you alone and that

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.320
everything else PEs in comparison.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.090
Lord, we pray this in your heaven name.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.380
Amen.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:02.550
Amen.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.610
So the one things that we'll see
here right off the bat, and I love

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.400
this, is the first line, Hallelujah.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.760
See, I think about this whenever
I think about, Hallelujah.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.560
I think about when I was in Africa.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.560
I used to go on a lot of mission trips
to Africa when I was at my pastor church.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.620
And when we go there, they would
gather a group of people up and

00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:21.390
that was the first thing they
would get to get their attention.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.250
They would say, Hallelujah,
and everybody would say, Amen.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.420
And then they would say, Amen.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.140
And you'd say, Hallelujah.

00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:31.410
And it was, it was kind of a call to
the service, a call to worship, a call.

00:12:32.115 --> 00:12:33.375
To focus on Jesus.

00:12:33.645 --> 00:12:37.725
See, when we look at the word,
hallelujah is, is really transferred or

00:12:37.725 --> 00:12:40.635
translated into God, be praised, right?

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.835
It's utter and worship as
an expression of rejoicing.

00:12:45.675 --> 00:12:48.765
So whenever I think about
Hallelujah, it is a call to worship.

00:12:48.765 --> 00:12:49.785
That's what this almost was doing.

00:12:49.905 --> 00:12:54.375
He was calling the people as he's
writing this to worship or to praise.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.459
I think about this like in this
moment, it's like everybody listen up.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.900
Hey, praise the Lord.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.160
God has changed my life.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.290
Everybody come near,
Let's praise the Lord.

00:13:04.295 --> 00:13:05.610
God has changed your life.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.370
Come on, praise the Lord.

00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:13.140
Why can we say hallelujah?

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.319
Because God has changed our lives.

00:13:16.324 --> 00:13:20.579
Praise the Lord and in this
call to worship or praise the

00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:24.000
reader and the writer of this
actually and the reader of us.

00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:27.555
Should realize that
this is all about Jesus.

00:13:27.555 --> 00:13:29.265
This is all about God, right?

00:13:29.415 --> 00:13:34.005
It's not focused on what this person gets
out of worship, but really in the fact

00:13:34.005 --> 00:13:36.135
of what, who we're worshiping, right?

00:13:36.194 --> 00:13:39.915
And it's putting all the focus
on what God has done, right?

00:13:40.095 --> 00:13:44.505
So true worship puts all the focus
on Jesus and not on ourselves.

00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:47.595
So this Psalm starts off with, hallelujah.

00:13:47.805 --> 00:13:49.575
Praise the Lord, right?

00:13:49.575 --> 00:13:50.444
God be praised.

00:13:50.745 --> 00:13:52.095
And it ends with hallelujah.

00:13:52.155 --> 00:13:53.095
God be praise.

00:13:53.655 --> 00:13:56.295
So let's jump in and we're gonna
answer a couple of questions.

00:13:56.295 --> 00:14:02.325
Number one, the Psalmus tells us where we
should praise God, where we should praise

00:14:02.325 --> 00:14:03.735
God, and we see this in the first verse.

00:14:03.975 --> 00:14:07.455
He says, Praise God in his sanctuary,
and praise him in his mighty expanse.

00:14:07.785 --> 00:14:13.485
So when we look at this, the Selmi is
saying, Praise God in his sanctuary.

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:17.939
In that time, obviously in the
Selma God, Its presence was in

00:14:17.939 --> 00:14:19.469
the temple or in the sanctuary.

00:14:19.469 --> 00:14:23.219
So people would come to the temple
and they would praise the Lord there.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.270
So somebody tell me this, what
has changed since the time of

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.699
this psalmist writing this?

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:30.569
Right?

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.030
Where is God's presence now?

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.550
Us everywhere.

00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:39.449
God's everywhere we are.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.370
That's everywhere in creation.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.860
Now we understand that
God's presence is every.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.270
So I love this when we look at.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.650
He's really challenging us, that if
we're reading this text, this, he

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:55.050
says, Praise God on earth, because
God's presence is everywhere.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.150
His presence is in us.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:01.380
And so when he says that there's no
place, guys, there's no place that

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.380
God should not be praised, no place.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.110
It's not just Sunday morning.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.939
And this is why I want us, It's so clear.

00:15:08.939 --> 00:15:12.600
If we read this as it sets,
you guys would say this.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.460
Yeah, we, we come every Sunday.

00:15:14.865 --> 00:15:17.745
They play instruments and we praise check.

00:15:19.005 --> 00:15:23.685
But now we see this in the way that
God has transformed his presence

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:25.755
in our lives, in everything we do.

00:15:25.905 --> 00:15:27.915
And the Soma says, Praise God.

00:15:27.975 --> 00:15:28.935
Everywhere.

00:15:29.385 --> 00:15:30.435
Everywhere you are.

00:15:30.705 --> 00:15:31.335
So think about this.

00:15:31.335 --> 00:15:36.045
You're in your car, you're in your
house, you're around family, you're

00:15:36.045 --> 00:15:40.395
at work, you're eating dinner,
you're obviously at church, right?

00:15:40.455 --> 00:15:43.875
You're in your small group,
but you can praise God every.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.710
Because there's no place
that we cannot have.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:47.250
Praise God.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.230
I challenge you to think on this guys.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:55.920
When we realize how precious
something is, we, we typically

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.700
take it and we, we honor it more.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.920
We, we, we cherish it more.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.170
But we live in a world, I say a world,
but we really live in, in, in, in a

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:12.800
nation that actually allows us to praise
God everywhere and to worship God every.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.250
There's so many countries where
if the name of Jesus is praised or

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:21.540
spoke about, they would be killed
or persecuted, and we aren't.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.579
So at times as a church, we say
our, we save our praising for

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:28.079
Sunday mornings, the sanctuary.

00:16:28.085 --> 00:16:30.660
We read this Psalm straight
up and we say, Yep, sanctuary.

00:16:30.665 --> 00:16:31.470
That's all we got.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:35.130
But God is challenging us to
praise even without music.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:39.390
So you understand this, It doesn't
take just music to praise the

00:16:39.395 --> 00:16:41.130
Lord or to worship the Lord.

00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:43.695
So we can praise God every.

00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:46.605
But then he challenges us, right?

00:16:46.665 --> 00:16:47.444
This is the cool part.

00:16:47.444 --> 00:16:48.704
This is where he kinda
gets up here, right?

00:16:48.704 --> 00:16:51.435
He says, Praise him in his mighty expanse.

00:16:51.735 --> 00:16:55.665
This idea is, is the idea of praising
him in heaven or praising him

00:16:55.665 --> 00:17:00.975
beyond our understanding, because
his power and his glory is mighty.

00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:04.065
It's vast, it's bright, it's powerful.

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:05.625
It influences the whole earth.

00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:08.685
So basically he's saying,
Praise God in heaven, because

00:17:08.775 --> 00:17:11.085
of all he has done, all he will.

00:17:11.754 --> 00:17:16.764
There is no place that is ever created
that we should not praise the Lord.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.395
And here's the thing, if you don't
like praise, you better not go to

00:17:20.395 --> 00:17:24.234
heaven cuz we're gonna spend the
rest of our lives praising the

00:17:24.234 --> 00:17:26.244
Lord and, and I'm telling you so.

00:17:26.335 --> 00:17:31.195
So you know, I understand this
is not a knock to anybody that

00:17:31.195 --> 00:17:33.175
doesn't want to praise in service.

00:17:34.645 --> 00:17:36.804
You don't have a good voice or you.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.990
You got a deep voice and
you don't sing louder.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:41.880
You're just not, You're very introverted.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.250
I get this, so that's not like
to knock on you on that, cuz

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:47.070
I get that it's uncomfortable
sometimes to praise in a group.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.330
But I would say this, this challenge
today is for us to recognize

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.060
when something is so precious.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:59.940
We recognize it by celebrating
it and giving praise and honor.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:06.480
And God has done so much for us that
if he did not do one more, He's worthy.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.879
We praise the rest of our
lives no matter where we are.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.280
That's the challenge
that we see here, right?

00:18:11.639 --> 00:18:14.040
So the first thing we learn
is where we should praise God

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.600
and ultimately everywhere.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.100
That's simple, right?

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.230
You can't find a place that you can't
praise him or you shouldn't praise him.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.639
Number two, right?

00:18:20.639 --> 00:18:23.879
In verse two, what
should we praise him for?

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:24.750
Right?

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.000
We can praise him anywhere,
but if I don't have a reason

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.139
to praise God, I won't do it.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.820
I just won't do it.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.180
Right?

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.030
So sometimes we need to know the reason.

00:18:33.915 --> 00:18:36.015
We should praise the Lord or
desire to praise the Lord.

00:18:36.075 --> 00:18:37.395
And so he says this in his word.

00:18:38.295 --> 00:18:41.025
Praise him for his powerful acts.

00:18:41.325 --> 00:18:44.805
Praise him for his abundant greatness.

00:18:44.835 --> 00:18:45.765
I love this.

00:18:46.215 --> 00:18:48.435
The word powerful and abundant.

00:18:49.335 --> 00:18:52.815
It just, it speaks of
all that God has done.

00:18:53.385 --> 00:18:55.965
He doesn't say, you know, praise
him for the small things that he's

00:18:55.965 --> 00:18:59.895
done and the occasional things
and the, you know, the, okay.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:05.310
He says, These are powerful acts
and these are abundant things.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:09.360
It's so easy to forget, as I was
talking about earlier, so easy

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.220
to forget all that God has done.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.690
I just want us to start
from the beginning.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:16.350
I'm not gonna just go a long, long ways
with this, but if you just use God's

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:22.200
word and you get into God's word and you
begin to think this, what powerful acts

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.960
and what abundant greatness did God do?

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.860
Read Genesis, God created
the heavens and the.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:34.889
He created everything, the water and
the trees, and the food and the animals.

00:19:34.889 --> 00:19:40.379
And his greatest creation is you like,
just stop there and we got enough.

00:19:40.905 --> 00:19:46.155
To praise the Lord forward because he is
great and powerful, but then it goes on.

00:19:46.155 --> 00:19:49.575
God desired to have a personal
relationship with with his creation,

00:19:49.575 --> 00:19:54.105
and so he did until obviously our
sin broke that, but God still pursued

00:19:54.105 --> 00:19:58.215
us so much that you see in the Word
of God in the Old Testament that

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.805
he pursued the people in slavery.

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:03.405
He brought them up outta slavery
and he showed so many mighty acts

00:20:03.405 --> 00:20:04.515
to give them the promise lane.

00:20:04.755 --> 00:20:07.245
Then even when they messed
up again, he brought them.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.050
Gave them a king.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.810
And whenever that messed up,
he still brought them back

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.280
again and he forgave them.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.370
And then if we wanna go in the
New Testament, he sent his son

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.860
Jesus because of his greatness.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.960
He could bring God into the flesh.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.580
Live a perfect life.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.920
To show what love and grace and
mercy and patience, and goodness and

00:20:28.925 --> 00:20:32.700
kindness and all these things that
we get to see in the life of Jesus.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.380
God gave us that.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.670
Then not only did he give us that
in the flesh, he says, No, I'm not

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.420
gonna judge you for your sins and
your fallenness, your brokenness.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.760
I'm going to judge my
son, my perfect son for.

00:20:45.215 --> 00:20:50.345
God's power is great because he chose to
take the punishment we deserve and place

00:20:50.345 --> 00:20:52.865
it on his son in which he sent for us.

00:20:52.955 --> 00:20:56.345
God's power, God's greatness.

00:20:56.554 --> 00:21:00.544
God has done so many things just
when we look at the word of God.

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:01.865
He is worthy to be praised.

00:21:01.865 --> 00:21:02.225
Amen.

00:21:02.675 --> 00:21:05.044
He is worthy to be praised.

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:06.635
That's enough.

00:21:07.985 --> 00:21:09.935
But this is the question I wanna ask now.

00:21:11.195 --> 00:21:11.975
What has God done for.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.500
Because I'm telling you at times when
you see God do something for somebody

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.669
else, it just doesn't hit sometimes
where we need it to hit because

00:21:20.669 --> 00:21:21.720
we're like, But that was for them.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.159
That was in the Old Testament.

00:21:23.399 --> 00:21:24.510
That was in the New Testament.

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:26.189
That was 2000 years ago.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.600
What's God done for me?

00:21:27.629 --> 00:21:28.409
Well, I know this.

00:21:28.409 --> 00:21:31.379
I've been around enough of you
long enough that you got something.

00:21:31.814 --> 00:21:33.435
To praise God for that.

00:21:33.435 --> 00:21:38.294
He has been great and he has done
abundant, and he has been powerful.

00:21:38.475 --> 00:21:39.705
So why don't we share some of those?

00:21:39.705 --> 00:21:48.165
What has God done for you that we can
praise the Lord about your turn life.

00:21:48.165 --> 00:21:50.115
Just being able to breathe and exist.

00:21:50.385 --> 00:21:50.685
Amen.

00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:51.284
What else?

00:21:52.334 --> 00:21:53.294
He's faithful.

00:21:53.985 --> 00:21:54.405
Amen.

00:21:54.465 --> 00:21:55.155
What else?

00:21:56.745 --> 00:21:56.925
Hmm?

00:21:58.034 --> 00:21:58.635
Family.

00:21:58.695 --> 00:21:58.965
Yes.

00:21:58.965 --> 00:21:59.985
God has provided family.

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:00.584
What else?

00:22:01.965 --> 00:22:02.745
Beating cancer.

00:22:02.745 --> 00:22:03.345
Amen.

00:22:03.465 --> 00:22:04.215
Praise God.

00:22:04.215 --> 00:22:04.545
Yeah.

00:22:05.475 --> 00:22:06.255
What else?

00:22:07.575 --> 00:22:07.995
Food.

00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:09.285
See, you're just gonna go down the list.

00:22:09.675 --> 00:22:12.105
Sleep, sugar.

00:22:12.135 --> 00:22:12.525
Okay.

00:22:12.945 --> 00:22:13.935
Thank you, Lord.

00:22:14.775 --> 00:22:15.765
Pray to Jesus.

00:22:16.695 --> 00:22:16.965
All right.

00:22:16.965 --> 00:22:17.595
What else?

00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:19.605
Forgiveness.

00:22:19.785 --> 00:22:20.265
Oh man.

00:22:20.265 --> 00:22:22.205
I need that purpose.

00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:22.845
Yes.

00:22:23.625 --> 00:22:24.045
Yes.

00:22:24.795 --> 00:22:25.365
What else?

00:22:26.475 --> 00:22:27.345
Salvation.

00:22:28.185 --> 00:22:28.725
Hope.

00:22:29.055 --> 00:22:29.655
Let's keep going.

00:22:32.264 --> 00:22:33.165
Community.

00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:36.195
Lets keep going.

00:22:36.195 --> 00:22:38.324
What can you praise the Lord about?

00:22:38.655 --> 00:22:39.314
Coffee?

00:22:39.705 --> 00:22:40.514

And parents who will buy it for you?

00:22:43.875 --> 00:22:44.804
Salvation.

00:22:45.014 --> 00:22:45.554
Yes.

00:22:45.855 --> 00:22:46.544
Peace.

00:22:47.094 --> 00:22:47.584
What?

00:22:49.304 --> 00:22:50.895
His Long suffering.

00:22:50.985 --> 00:22:51.554
Oh man.

00:22:52.445 --> 00:22:53.004
Music.

00:22:53.475 --> 00:22:54.165
Holy Spirit.

00:22:55.965 --> 00:22:56.715
Anything else?

00:22:57.435 --> 00:22:58.544
What can you praise the Lord.

00:23:00.945 --> 00:23:01.875
Inspiring Hope Church.

00:23:01.875 --> 00:23:02.265
Amen.

00:23:02.595 --> 00:23:04.725
This community of people,
guys brought together.

00:23:05.085 --> 00:23:05.415
Amen.

00:23:06.315 --> 00:23:09.885
Because I think, and this is the cool
part, and I, and I'm so glad you guys

00:23:09.885 --> 00:23:13.455
participated in this, I think we could
continue to go on and, and I, and

00:23:13.455 --> 00:23:16.035
we could continue to dive a little
bit deeper because what I would say

00:23:16.035 --> 00:23:20.805
is majority, not all, majority of
these were very like surface level.

00:23:22.605 --> 00:23:26.505
So as you start thinking about diving
a little bit deeper, I'm gonna give you

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:27.915
some stories where I can praise the.

00:23:28.815 --> 00:23:32.775
I want you to think of those stories
in your life, and I want you to

00:23:32.775 --> 00:23:33.855
praise the Lord for those two.

00:23:34.425 --> 00:23:38.955
So I think about this guys, despite the
difficulties that I went through as a

00:23:38.955 --> 00:23:42.585
child and, and there's a long story that
some of you heard, some of you haven't.

00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:48.045
I was still able to find hope and
help in Jesus despite those things

00:23:48.225 --> 00:23:51.555
from unforgiveness that I had to
selfishness that I had as, as I

00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:54.735
was getting to an adult and as
the greed that I had in my life.

00:23:55.245 --> 00:23:56.685
I'm so thankful.

00:23:57.105 --> 00:24:00.165
That the Lord was powerful enough to
bring me outta those circumstances

00:24:00.165 --> 00:24:02.085
and those situations to save me.

00:24:02.625 --> 00:24:05.355
I start thinking about my
marriage and my four wonderful

00:24:05.355 --> 00:24:07.065
kids, and, and there's no reason.

00:24:07.065 --> 00:24:10.515
I'm just telling you, there's some
things again that everybody doesn't

00:24:10.515 --> 00:24:15.555
fully understand, but our marriage
is, is today what it is, because

00:24:15.555 --> 00:24:19.965
God saved that marriage through
saving me and changing our family

00:24:19.965 --> 00:24:21.465
by bringing Jesus into our life.

00:24:21.795 --> 00:24:25.005
We have the kids in our
life because God save.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.080
Our family and he showed up in our family.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:32.310
See, here's a a, a, a personal story, and
again, you guys have probably heard, some

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:36.720
of you heard this, but Teagan's story
when Teagan, literally she had lung issues

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.090
right after birth and God saved her.

00:24:39.689 --> 00:24:42.210
And we still to this day,
we don't wanna take that for

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.250
granted because God showed up.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.169
We have a lot to praise God for.

00:24:46.169 --> 00:24:50.100
I'll just tell you this, God has
provided job after Job, financial

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.870
providence, time after time.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:53.070
No, I'm not rich.

00:24:53.189 --> 00:24:54.060
My bank account's not.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.840
But it seemed like every single
time that our family had a need.

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:02.760
God provided for that need, and
as I think back, God is powerful.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.110
God is good.

00:25:04.379 --> 00:25:06.930
His greatness is amazing.

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.030
Then I think about this church.

00:25:09.419 --> 00:25:12.720
And all the people in here and how
God brought each one of you into this

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.590
story, and he's transformed your life
and he's used you in the situations.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.720
He's used you and he has used you.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.840
So you know, from a personal temple
in our family, to bless us and to

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.970
love on us and to support us and to
encourage us as a family, God is good.

00:25:27.915 --> 00:25:32.565
When I think of these things guys,
and I start actually listing out where

00:25:32.565 --> 00:25:37.845
God has shown up powerfully, where he
has shown abundant things in my life.

00:25:37.875 --> 00:25:44.955
Oh my gosh, praise be to God, but you
are as much the struggle that I have.

00:25:45.615 --> 00:25:47.385
I asked the question, What
have you done for me lately?

00:25:48.825 --> 00:25:50.055
And, and we're here in a moment.

00:25:50.055 --> 00:25:53.355
We're gonna get to talk about the
different words in Hebrew appraise,

00:25:53.355 --> 00:25:55.245
and you're gonna love this because
man, it just transformed my.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:02.130
But I, I tend to get caught up in only
praising God for what he's done for me

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:06.630
lately and complaining to God about what
he's not done for me lately as well.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.240
And man, this is just transforming
my heart and I hope it transforms

00:26:10.245 --> 00:26:13.040
your heart and what praise is, right?

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.440
We can look at this and
we can say, Hallelujah.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.090
Praise God everywhere.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.240
And for everything God
is worthy to be praise.

00:26:22.514 --> 00:26:25.754
He talks about that, right, That we
can praise God everywhere and we can

00:26:25.754 --> 00:26:27.805
praise God for everything he's done.

00:26:28.575 --> 00:26:31.125
But then he says, How
should we praise him?

00:26:31.425 --> 00:26:36.075
And I'm gonna expand on this because
he's going to use one specific angle of,

00:26:36.105 --> 00:26:39.855
of, of worship or praise, and he's gonna
talk about these instruments, right?

00:26:40.004 --> 00:26:43.815
He speaks directly to this and he says
this, Praise him with the trumpet blast.

00:26:44.115 --> 00:26:45.764
Praise him with the harp and a ear.

00:26:45.915 --> 00:26:47.795
Praise him with the tambourine and dance.

00:26:48.315 --> 00:26:49.815
Praise him with strings and flute.

00:26:50.055 --> 00:26:51.705
Praise him with resounding symbols.

00:26:52.004 --> 00:26:56.235
After I read this, I called up Matt,
Amanda, Laura Orville, Everybody's on tech

00:26:56.235 --> 00:26:57.675
team, said We gotta change instrument.

00:26:58.034 --> 00:26:58.845
We're doing it wrong.

00:26:59.745 --> 00:27:02.595
They laughed and said,
Eh, we've progressed.

00:27:02.625 --> 00:27:04.004
Okay, so, okay, I see it.

00:27:04.155 --> 00:27:04.665
It's okay.

00:27:05.504 --> 00:27:10.125
But really what he is saying here is
this is a type of worship or praise

00:27:10.125 --> 00:27:14.415
that included instruments that would
be created to praise God, right?

00:27:14.685 --> 00:27:18.735
Obviously, we've seen them adapt and
change, but I wanna take some time to

00:27:18.735 --> 00:27:22.245
talk about multiple ways that we can
praise God, not just with instruments.

00:27:23.025 --> 00:27:25.815
So in doing research, cool part,
again, this isn't on me, this is

00:27:25.815 --> 00:27:27.645
on what God does in his providence.

00:27:28.095 --> 00:27:33.015
I, I found an article talking about
seven Hebrew words for praise or worship.

00:27:33.525 --> 00:27:36.225
I wanna talk about this and, and Peyton
and Chan are actually gonna go hand

00:27:36.225 --> 00:27:38.505
these out to you guys cause I want
you to see these copies and you can

00:27:38.505 --> 00:27:40.095
have, I want you guys start doing that.

00:27:40.095 --> 00:27:41.505
You start handing those out to everybody.

00:27:41.775 --> 00:27:44.835
Um, start with one per family and
when you get done, go back around

00:27:44.835 --> 00:27:46.425
and give extras to everybody.

00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:49.695
Um, cause I think we have enough, I
think I printed off like 20 something,

00:27:49.845 --> 00:27:51.425
but just start passing 'em out and we.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.110
Here's what I want you to think about
as we talk about these words of praise.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.250
How many of all in the same
sentence said, Man, I love my

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.629
wife and I love cheeseburgers.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:03.720
Okay.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.800
Maybe, or husband.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.429
Hey.

00:28:05.429 --> 00:28:05.879
There we go.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:06.780
Dave's got me.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:07.470
Thanks, Dave.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:13.679
Okay, we, we used the word love
in the same sentence, but do

00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:14.939
we really mean the same thing?

00:28:14.939 --> 00:28:16.770
Honey, I'm pretty sure I
love you more than a cheese.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:18.899
Okay.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:19.830
Exactly.

00:28:20.129 --> 00:28:23.730
So what I would mean by that,
in our English words, we

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.169
sometimes don't differentiate.

00:28:25.169 --> 00:28:27.870
Now we understand when I use the word
love for cheeseburgers and love for my

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.320
wife, you guys know what that means.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.280
But at times we don't really
communicate that, right?

00:28:35.429 --> 00:28:40.379
And so when we read in God's Word
and we see the word praise, or we

00:28:40.379 --> 00:28:42.510
see the word worship, but most of the
time it's translate praise, right?

00:28:42.629 --> 00:28:43.139
Praise.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.310
We think, Oh, it's just praise.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.449
So it's one way of praise.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.310
But there's actually multiple ways
that these words are translated, and

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.940
you're gonna love this because it's
changed me as I begin to read over this.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.120
So we're gonna walk through this
together and we're gonna see

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.620
these different words, appraise.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.710
And so starting there again,
this is from Aglo International

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.629
seven Hebrew Words for Praise.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.010
We're gonna watch three each one.

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.560
And if I don't say the Hebrew
word correctly, just forgive me.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.890
Okay?

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.140
The first one is Halal.

00:29:10.665 --> 00:29:15.195
It says it is a primary Hebrew
root, root word for praise, right?

00:29:15.195 --> 00:29:18.465
Our word for hallelujah
comes from this base word.

00:29:18.824 --> 00:29:22.365
It means to be clear, to praise,
to shine, to boast, to show,

00:29:22.365 --> 00:29:23.955
to ra, to celebrate, right?

00:29:24.915 --> 00:29:26.685
So I'm gonna have you guys participate.

00:29:26.925 --> 00:29:27.584
Who wants to read?

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.564
I just want, We're just gonna read one
verse out of each one of these sections.

00:29:29.564 --> 00:29:30.675
Who wants to read that first verse?

00:29:30.675 --> 00:29:31.485
It's listened on the paper.

00:29:31.485 --> 00:29:32.985
There's Psalm 1 13, 1 through three.

00:29:33.044 --> 00:29:34.995
And don't you say the word in parenthesis.

00:29:34.995 --> 00:29:36.645
That's just what that word praise means.

00:29:36.915 --> 00:29:37.995
Who wants to say Elisa?

00:29:37.995 --> 00:29:38.115
Go.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.610
So when we look at this word,
this is an invitation to worship.

00:29:51.479 --> 00:29:55.500
This is to praise and, and so you
guys know, each week our worship

00:29:55.504 --> 00:29:58.409
team is teaching you to halal.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.679
They are inviting you
to worship, to praise.

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:08.460
To invite you in, to praise the Lord, to
shine and to to show the magnitude of God.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:15.570
And so when they worship, they are shining
the light of Jesus for the world to see.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:17.820
And so a lot of times
we're doing this on Sunday.

00:30:17.825 --> 00:30:19.740
So that's just a great example of Sunday.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:24.810
So the next one is yadda, and it's
a verb with the root meaning is to

00:30:24.815 --> 00:30:28.710
the extended hand to throw out the
hand, therefore, to worship with the

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:30.600
extended hand or to lift the hand.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.790
Here's where we start getting
uncomfortable because it's the

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:39.000
moment where I, just so you guys
know, I'm from the Baptist faith.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.830
This is, this is sometimes allowed,
but when we start going here, it

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:48.570
may get a little bit uncomfortable
in the church, but, but the word

00:30:48.575 --> 00:30:53.820
praise in some instances, in the
word of God talks about praise.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:31:00.450
And, and, and I look at this and I
go, This is honorable to God, right?

00:31:00.455 --> 00:31:01.170
It's uncom.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:06.540
But I wanna challenge you with this, when
our comfort is more important than his,

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:12.630
um, command to worship, when our comfort
is more important than his command to

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:18.330
worship, than we probably are worshiping
the wrong thing, which is our comfort.

00:31:18.335 --> 00:31:23.070
It's just so you know, this steps on
my toes because it took me so long.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:26.400
If Brit knows this, it took me so
long to get comfortable to probably

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.510
even just take my hands outta my.

00:31:28.545 --> 00:31:28.845
, Right?

00:31:28.845 --> 00:31:29.955
And maybe start bouncing the knee.

00:31:30.254 --> 00:31:30.615
Right.

00:31:30.765 --> 00:31:34.155
And I just so you know, I mean you
guys probably watched that little

00:31:34.455 --> 00:31:37.125
spoof of the guy, the comedian,
talking about the hands worship.

00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:37.695
It's hilarious.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.205
It's great.

00:31:38.205 --> 00:31:38.835
You should watch it.

00:31:38.835 --> 00:31:39.885
I probably should have put up here today.

00:31:39.945 --> 00:31:43.425
But my, the point behind this is
when we're talking about worship,

00:31:44.145 --> 00:31:47.115
this is one way that God has called
us in the word of God to worship.

00:31:47.115 --> 00:31:49.695
So who wants to read
Second Chronicles 2021?

00:31:49.695 --> 00:31:54.315
That's on here, the first
scripture on the page for this one.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:54.975
Who wants to read?

00:31:57.645 --> 00:32:01.574
Anybody, Oh, let's go back here
to Dave and I'll come back to you.

00:32:02.054 --> 00:32:02.415
Yep.

00:32:06.435 --> 00:32:06.854
Amen.

00:32:07.274 --> 00:32:07.514
Right.

00:32:07.844 --> 00:32:09.614
So we look at this,
give thanks to the Lord.

00:32:09.614 --> 00:32:12.465
And then when he's saying this, he's
saying, Give thanks to the Lord.

00:32:12.645 --> 00:32:15.705
Brez loving kindness is everlasting.

00:32:16.574 --> 00:32:18.915
Do you guys know what this sign is?

00:32:18.915 --> 00:32:19.875
And this not a good sign?

00:32:20.014 --> 00:32:24.195
When the police officer says,
Put your hands up, surrender.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:26.280
Right.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.110
It's, it's, Here's what it is.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:29.880
It's a sign of weakness.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.850
You're open, you're vulnerable.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.200
You wanna know why?

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.850
We probably struggle to lift our hands
in worship because we're vulnerable, but

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.700
praise, praise leads us to vulnerability.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.190
It leads us open to God.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:48.960
It, it, it, it's, it's a form of
surrender, and yet it's uncomfortable.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.710
I know this, Just so you know, this
isn't a Sunday morning thing either.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.820
This is a life.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.380
So every morning, uh, think about this.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:04.290
Maybe you need to yada in the morning
and just surrender to the Lord, right?

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:10.080
Maybe it's at work when it is difficult,
and you need to remind yourself that his

00:33:10.085 --> 00:33:13.800
loving kindness is everlasting, right?

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.330
Is what we need.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:18.180
And God is called us in
the, in the word to do this.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.910
So let's look at the next one so you know.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.330
This is one that, that, that I need more.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.200
I need more.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:25.950
It's taa.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.050
It comes from the same principle
Root, root word of yadda it,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.670
but is used more specifically.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:38.160
TAA literally means an extension of the
hand in adoration of vow or acceptance.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.650
And I love this by way of application.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:45.270
It is apparent in the Psalms and
elsewhere that it is used for thanking

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.240
God for things not yet received.

00:33:49.169 --> 00:33:50.430
As things Yah.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:51.810
Not yet received.

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:53.460
Let me just give you a great example here.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.800
It's praising in Faith.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:01.409
Heard the story where this guy was going
through all these strategies and all

00:34:01.409 --> 00:34:07.080
these difficulties, but it seemed like
he just was always praising the Lord.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:11.610
And somebody asked him this question,
How do you praise the Lord in the

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:13.110
midst of these dire situations?

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.150
How do you not worry?

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.650
And this is what the, the guy says.

00:34:16.654 --> 00:34:17.580
He says, I don't worry.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:17.759
I.

00:34:19.094 --> 00:34:19.995
I don't worry.

00:34:20.505 --> 00:34:21.105
I worship.

00:34:22.154 --> 00:34:27.045
So this is a challenge to move our worry
of whether we have enough money or whether

00:34:27.045 --> 00:34:31.545
we're, what is the doctor gonna say or
will we ever get over this hump of this?

00:34:31.545 --> 00:34:33.884
Or will our kids ever, ever learn this?

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:37.755
Or will we ever have a good marriage
or will our kids ever listen to us?

00:34:37.904 --> 00:34:47.654
Whatever you worry about, our worry
should transition into DA to worship.

00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:51.795
To worship and faith that God
will change your circumstances.

00:34:52.035 --> 00:34:58.785
To know that God hears your praise,
your praise to God is an offering

00:34:59.385 --> 00:35:05.355
to him, and he hears you and he
desires to move on your behalf, and

00:35:05.355 --> 00:35:07.695
it's a prayer and praise of faith.

00:35:08.805 --> 00:35:10.395
He goes, I need this.

00:35:10.995 --> 00:35:11.685
I need this.

00:35:11.685 --> 00:35:16.335
Because it is hard sometimes to praise
in the midst of uncertainty and.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.100
So somebody read Psalm 50 14.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.040
Let's, let's just let Lauren do this
cuz you raised your hand in a minute.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.140
Psalm 50 14 is that first one.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:30.450
Amen.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:35.819
So we see that God desires
for us to praise and faith.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:36.930
So let's continue on.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:42.480
The next one on the backside is Shaak,
which means to shout, to address and allow

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.270
tone and to command a trumpet or tri.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.600
Let me mention two examples.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.070
So I think this'll make sense.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.170
Number one, it's a spiritual example.

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:52.890
I'll go first.

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:55.531
I don't know if you've ever,
And it's occasional, I dunno if

00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.850
you've ever heard my wife in the
middle of worship, just go, Whoa.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.460
And you're probably
wondering what just happened.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.840
That is an expression of Shabbat.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:11.580
It is a loud shout to praise the Lord.

00:36:12.525 --> 00:36:15.825
To address the Lord and
to to give him praise.

00:36:16.035 --> 00:36:21.075
And again, guys, this is
uncomfortable because shouldn't

00:36:21.075 --> 00:36:22.215
we be reserved and humble?

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.245
And we'll get to that one at times.

00:36:25.425 --> 00:36:28.755
The word of God, and I'm gonna
read this one in Psalm 47, 1,

00:36:28.755 --> 00:36:30.375
he says, Oh, clap your hands.

00:36:30.375 --> 00:36:33.795
All you people shout to
God with the voice of joy.

00:36:34.485 --> 00:36:38.415
Sometimes that's what we need
to do, is to praise God in that.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.120
See, here's one where you're gonna relate.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.570
If you're a Bengals fan and when
Dallas is getting hammered later,

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:46.470
you know what you're gonna do?

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:47.760
Woo.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:49.830
Go Bengals.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.070
And that's not gonna be
uncomfortable, is it?

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.090
But it's uncomfortable to pray.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.180
I'm just so you know, I'm
stepping on my own toes.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.260
This isn't just you.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:02.180
Okay?

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.780
It's some challenging me that God is
teaching us what worship truly is.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.810
Let's look at the next one, Barack, which
means to kneel down to, bless God as an

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:16.290
act of adoration or to salute, right?

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:18.630
This is that moment of humility.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.900
This is that moment that we saw
Amanda up here, where she just

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:26.610
felt so led by God to get a hundred
earns and to just say, I surrender.

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:28.590
Lord, I praise you for who you are.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.500
This is a difficult position.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.790
Number one, my knees are hurting.

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:36.360
Number two, if you're old
enough, you might not get back.

00:37:38.174 --> 00:37:43.125
But it is a position that
is honoring to the Lord.

00:37:43.125 --> 00:37:48.555
Guys, it, it is a show that you
need God to move, that he is

00:37:48.555 --> 00:37:55.785
good, that he is worthy to be
humble and to go before the Lord.

00:37:56.835 --> 00:37:59.174
See, this is another area and
I want somebody to read this.

00:37:59.174 --> 00:38:00.855
Verse nine, Psalm 95.

00:38:00.855 --> 00:38:03.524
Actually, I want you to read
Psalm 34, 1, which is the last

00:38:03.524 --> 00:38:05.685
one on this one, Psalm 34, 1.

00:38:05.685 --> 00:38:06.404
Who wants to read that?

00:38:07.155 --> 00:38:07.515
Chaning.

00:38:07.575 --> 00:38:08.085
Go ahead buddy.

00:38:15.525 --> 00:38:19.545
I love that his praise shall
continually be in my mouth.

00:38:20.415 --> 00:38:24.435
I heard somebody give this example on
this one that even though we are bowed

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:29.235
down, we're kneeling down to the Lord
that this is a praise, that our eyes

00:38:29.235 --> 00:38:35.505
never leave the Lord, that we follow
him wherever he goes, That we do not.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:41.310
Let our lives ever stop seeing
the Lord and to praise him.

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:42.270
Right.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.779
The next one is Zar, and we kind
of already talked about this one.

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:48.299
Zar means to pluck the
strings of an instrument.

00:38:48.305 --> 00:38:48.720
Right.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:49.860
Good job, Matt and Doug.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:50.370
You're doing it.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:51.060
Woohoo.

00:38:51.779 --> 00:38:54.149
Right, Or to sing and to praise.

00:38:54.149 --> 00:38:56.250
So good job, everybody that's
singing and praising right?

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:59.460
Musical words, which is largely
involved with joyful expressions of

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.649
music with musical instruments, right?

00:39:01.649 --> 00:39:02.850
So weekly worship.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:04.169
This makes total sense.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:05.279
Does somebody run a read?

00:39:05.279 --> 00:39:06.960
Psalm 2113 for me.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.100
Amen.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.830
Man, this last one's a fun one.

00:39:21.569 --> 00:39:27.180
Tola Tola, and this is not tequila, so
don't go home and praise God with tequila.

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.100
It's Tola.

00:39:30.509 --> 00:39:31.560
Make sure we got that right.

00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.310
Don't what?

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.350
You send me pictures later
saying I'm praise in God.

00:39:38.879 --> 00:39:39.900
I'll pay for that one later.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:45.930
So this is actually a really good one.

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:46.710
Let's get serious here.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:47.460
This is really good one.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.145
This is another one of my, Okay,
that's another one of my favorites.

00:39:50.415 --> 00:39:54.855
It's derived from the word halah and
means to sing the singing of haahs,

00:39:55.095 --> 00:39:59.775
or to sing or to law, perceived to
involve music, especially singing

00:39:59.775 --> 00:40:02.325
hymns of the spirit or praise.

00:40:03.135 --> 00:40:05.145
And as it begin to study a little
bit more about this, this is

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:06.495
just really a great example.

00:40:06.495 --> 00:40:08.805
This is really spontaneous singing.

00:40:09.975 --> 00:40:12.555
Any better ever just walking around
and all of a sudden you just start

00:40:12.555 --> 00:40:15.555
singing and sometimes it's to
some of the worship songs that you

00:40:15.555 --> 00:40:16.725
know, but sometimes it's your own.

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:21.120
See this to Lela is
sometimes a personal song.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:23.730
It's a moment when you
start repeating words.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.970
That means something so much
deepens down inside your heart.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.090
It's a new song for you guys.

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:34.530
There is days where I sing a new
song and it's a song of praise to the

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:40.200
Lord that is an offering to him that,
that he hears and I need him to hear.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:40.740
Right?

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:45.030
And so he says this in Psalm
22, 3, Yet that art holy.

00:40:45.585 --> 00:40:49.365
O Thal who art and thrown
upon the praise of Israel.

00:40:50.265 --> 00:40:55.935
And so I gave you these, this handout
one to say thank you to the person that

00:40:55.935 --> 00:40:57.495
did do this because this was powerful.

00:40:57.495 --> 00:40:58.935
As begin to study more about this.

00:40:59.294 --> 00:41:03.915
But two, this is a great thing
to hang up on your, your, your, I

00:41:03.915 --> 00:41:04.694
don't know if you still do this.

00:41:04.694 --> 00:41:09.375
Hang it up on your fridge, put it in
your prayer journal and think what is,

00:41:09.524 --> 00:41:12.504
what is one area that I can praise God.

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:17.835
In today that I can, I can
praise him in a different way.

00:41:18.105 --> 00:41:20.385
I can worship him in a different way.

00:41:20.925 --> 00:41:23.355
And we see these as examples to follow.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.185
So I hope this was helpful for you.

00:41:25.455 --> 00:41:27.135
It encouraged me for sure.

00:41:28.725 --> 00:41:31.875
So as we see these seven different
ways to praise God, these are

00:41:31.875 --> 00:41:33.225
all different ways to show.

00:41:33.615 --> 00:41:36.885
Show our appreciation, our love, our
trust, our faith, our belief in God.

00:41:37.365 --> 00:41:41.565
He is our sustainer, our provider, and
our savior, and he is worthy to be praise.

00:41:42.645 --> 00:41:45.314
Let's not miss the last
part of this psalm.

00:41:46.035 --> 00:41:47.384
Who should be praised?

00:41:47.384 --> 00:41:49.154
So we said, Where should he be praised?

00:41:50.234 --> 00:41:51.375
Why should he be praised?

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:55.845
Basically how he should be
praised and who should praise him?

00:41:56.205 --> 00:41:58.754
It says, Let everything that breathe.

00:41:59.174 --> 00:41:59.774
Praise the Lord.

00:41:59.774 --> 00:42:00.944
Everybody do something with me.

00:42:01.064 --> 00:42:01.634
Everybody ready?

00:42:01.634 --> 00:42:02.055
On three?

00:42:02.055 --> 00:42:02.955
You're gonna take a deep breath.

00:42:02.955 --> 00:42:04.395
1, 2, 3.

00:42:06.495 --> 00:42:06.915
Great.

00:42:07.605 --> 00:42:08.774
We all fit this standard.

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:09.569
Huh?

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:10.799
Check mark.

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:12.029
You can't get outta this one.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:12.600
Okay?

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:16.140
Let everything that
breathes, praise the Lord.

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:20.279
Let me ask this question to you.

00:42:20.819 --> 00:42:23.880
Why should everyone that
breathes praise the Lord?

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.020
Because we have breath
in our, It's simple.

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:33.450
It's, it's that simple.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.580
And, and guys, so you understand.

00:42:38.415 --> 00:42:41.715
You may be going through or have gone
through some of the most difficult

00:42:41.715 --> 00:42:45.555
circumstances in your life and I can't
even imagine what you're dealing with.

00:42:46.305 --> 00:42:49.245
But if you just took a deep
breath, God is worthy to be

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.725
praised like in the simplest thing.

00:42:52.725 --> 00:42:55.785
Maybe you've gotta narrow it down
to that today and some days, that's

00:42:55.785 --> 00:42:57.165
all I need to narrow down to, Lord.

00:42:57.375 --> 00:43:00.255
Everything seems to be falling down
around me, but that breath that I

00:43:00.255 --> 00:43:02.444
just breathe is enough to praise you.

00:43:03.225 --> 00:43:05.265
Everything that has breath should praise.

00:43:07.965 --> 00:43:10.845
So why do we struggle to praise God?

00:43:11.595 --> 00:43:14.835
It's usually, and, and again, when I say
why do we struggle to praise God in these

00:43:14.835 --> 00:43:20.085
ways that we just mentioned, it's usually
because we say this one, I'm not a singer.

00:43:20.085 --> 00:43:22.665
My voice is bad and I will am with you.

00:43:22.665 --> 00:43:24.285
I am not a good singer, right?

00:43:24.825 --> 00:43:25.905
I'm uncomfortable.

00:43:26.385 --> 00:43:28.725
It's, it's uncomfortable to praise
God in some of these ways because

00:43:28.875 --> 00:43:30.405
it, it, it makes me vulnerable.

00:43:30.405 --> 00:43:33.105
Or what if somebody looks at
me and what if I look weird?

00:43:33.105 --> 00:43:33.745
What if I sound.

00:43:35.174 --> 00:43:35.774
I get it.

00:43:37.365 --> 00:43:39.555
We struggle to praise the Lord
sometimes because we take it for

00:43:39.555 --> 00:43:44.055
granted that we get to praise the one
who gave us everything we have, right?

00:43:45.225 --> 00:43:46.904
So I look at this and I say, I get it.

00:43:47.564 --> 00:43:48.855
I totally understand it.

00:43:49.395 --> 00:43:55.185
My challenge for you is to lean into
it a little bit more and, and, and

00:43:55.185 --> 00:43:58.395
to begin to find ways to worship
the Lord differently this week.

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.100
Look at this list and say, How
can I, even if it's in the own

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:06.419
private room on your drive, that
you start shouting out to the Lord.

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:11.910
Or maybe it's in your closet where
you get out on your knees, or maybe

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:17.450
it's next week on Sunday when we have
a worship Sunday where you join and

00:44:17.609 --> 00:44:21.450
worship for the first time and you
belt out as loud as you came with with.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:23.400
Whatever it is.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:27.480
I just encourage you to take a next
step and experience what the Lord has

00:44:27.485 --> 00:44:31.470
given us as a, as an opportunity, as
an example, as a command to praise

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:33.090
him even though it's uncomfortable.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.710
I wanna end, before I kind of walk
through a conclusion here of, of

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:39.330
the message I wanna walk through.

00:44:39.335 --> 00:44:41.970
Psalm 96, this Psalm came to my
heart and I really wanted to walk

00:44:41.975 --> 00:44:45.450
through this, and so I'm asking for
one person to read the whole psalm.

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:50.910
So is there somebody would love to
read Psalm 96 all the way through?

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:55.350
Anybody.

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:59.250
Psalm 96, all the way
through, Ryan's gonna read.

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.120
Okay, here we go.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:00.810
Psalm 96.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:14.680
No.

00:46:17.549 --> 00:46:17.730
thank you.

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:23.549
Since we think about worship and we
think about a couple of different

00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:24.690
things, I want you to think about this.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:29.129
God was never created for us.

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:30.990
We were created for.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.370
So when we come to worship God
every day, whether it's worship

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:39.750
service, whether it's in our own
time in the cars, our preference

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:43.560
or our desires to be comfortable
is not the most important thing.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.260
Worship, I've heard this statement before.

00:46:46.265 --> 00:46:50.730
Worship is about giving
your breath back to God.

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:57.630
So when you sing, it is an offering
to him, and he doesn't say, Seeing

00:46:57.635 --> 00:47:00.210
only if you have a good voice
and you can be in the key of B.

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:00.900
I don't even know if that's.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:02.419
Okay.

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:06.960
If you, I dunno if it's not sorry,
but anyways, that's how much I don't

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.980
know, worship and I still sing.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:08.370
Okay.

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:09.419
That's just a great example.

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:12.810
So when worship's about giving
your breath back to God, right?

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:17.250
Giving our praise, our life, our gratitude
to God and all he has done for us,

00:47:17.549 --> 00:47:19.740
we have all been given the resources.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:20.520
This is my challenge.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:24.750
Every week we, I, I give you the resources
to go out and apply this to your life.

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:27.149
This, this paper that talks about
the seven different ways that

00:47:27.149 --> 00:47:30.450
we can praise and worship God,
Which ones have you neglect?

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:35.790
I can see a couple on there where I'm good
at, like I love praising the Lord in these

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:37.350
areas, but there's some that's vulnerable.

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:39.180
There's some that I've just been avoiding.

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.970
There's some that I didn't even know
about, and I'm hoping that you learn

00:47:41.975 --> 00:47:45.089
something today that you can begin
to apply these to your life and be a

00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:46.830
part of the corporate worship as well.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:51.690
So take them, practice them,
talk about them, live them out.

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:55.259
And as you do, I'll just tell you this,
as you do, not only are we honoring the

00:47:55.259 --> 00:47:57.839
Lord, but there is something special.

00:47:58.049 --> 00:47:59.370
There's something special.

00:47:59.985 --> 00:48:04.035
About worshiping the Lord and how
that brings you closer to God.

00:48:04.335 --> 00:48:06.495
And if you're wondering this,
just, just wanna challenge you,

00:48:06.495 --> 00:48:10.515
this, you ever struggle with just
wanting to get in the word of God?

00:48:10.875 --> 00:48:11.355
I know I do.

00:48:11.415 --> 00:48:13.154
Even as a pastor, I don't
wanna open the word of God.

00:48:13.154 --> 00:48:18.555
I'm like, Eh, when I spend time praising
the Lord, like I'll turn on music

00:48:18.555 --> 00:48:20.384
and I start praising Lord in genuine.

00:48:20.384 --> 00:48:22.125
I'm listening to the words
and I'm praising him.

00:48:23.235 --> 00:48:24.075
I wanna know him more.

00:48:24.075 --> 00:48:26.455
And then it just makes me wanna
get into the word and it, and

00:48:26.455 --> 00:48:27.495
it makes me wanna know him more.

00:48:27.495 --> 00:48:28.695
And it makes me wanna tell other people.

00:48:29.535 --> 00:48:31.575
When I spend time praise in the Lord.

00:48:32.325 --> 00:48:33.495
So maybe that's what you need.

00:48:34.095 --> 00:48:37.515
Maybe that's what we all need, is just
to start with praise in the mornings,

00:48:38.145 --> 00:48:41.415
and maybe that will draw you into more
of the Lord and more of what God's called

00:48:41.415 --> 00:48:43.274
you to and more to experience of him.

00:48:44.355 --> 00:48:47.565
But my challenge always is every
week is if you're sitting here

00:48:47.565 --> 00:48:50.565
and you're hearing worship about
the Lord and how do I worship him?

00:48:50.569 --> 00:48:52.245
But you've never given your life to him.

00:48:53.024 --> 00:48:56.565
Maybe you've never just taken that
step of faith to say, I trust you and I

00:48:56.565 --> 00:48:58.484
believe that you are worthy to be worship.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:48:59.850
Today is that day.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.320
Today is that day.

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:06.900
And I think too many times we put it off
till tomorrow next week when today is the

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:13.260
day that God has given you to experience
his hope and his salvation and his love,

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:17.460
and a day that you can begin to worship
him truly with your heart and your life.

00:49:17.465 --> 00:49:19.560
And if that's you today,
I want to talk with you.

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:20.850
That's why I stand in the back.

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:22.380
That's why I stay at service.

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:23.790
Over to the next steps table, I wanna.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:27.210
Conversations about what
it means to follow Jesus.

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.330
I wanna have conversations with you
about applying these things today.

00:49:30.335 --> 00:49:33.360
If you're struggling with worship and
how to, if you've given your life to

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.150
Christ and just struggling with being
engaged with the Lord and and being

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:39.450
able to follow him, maybe you need to
just come talk and I don't have anything

00:49:39.455 --> 00:49:42.780
special other than just a friend to
listen to and talk about what we can

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:44.460
do together to help pursue the Lord.

00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:46.259
I challenge you to take that next step.

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:49.170
I challenge you the next day,
the next step, but during.

00:49:49.575 --> 00:49:50.234
Invitation.

00:49:50.234 --> 00:49:54.375
When we take time to pray and ask Lord
this question, what parts of worship

00:49:54.375 --> 00:49:55.785
do we need to apply to our lives?

00:49:56.325 --> 00:49:58.214
What areas do I need
to take next steps in?

00:49:58.214 --> 00:50:02.654
Maybe it's a step of faith during
this time of invitation, do that.

00:50:02.984 --> 00:50:08.924
But then as we stand up to worship,
worship differently, worship differently.

00:50:09.555 --> 00:50:13.845
Then when you sat down at the end
of worship, that may look something

00:50:13.845 --> 00:50:18.315
different for each person, but don't
hold back because Jesus is worth.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:24.990
To worship, so I'm gonna pray for us and
then we will have a time of invitation.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:26.580
Lord Jesus, we love you, Lord.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:34.380
We're so thankful, Lord for you, because
we know that you love us so much.

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:39.750
Lord, as we reflect on this
psalm, we reflect on how you've

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:41.910
invited us to praise the Lord.

00:50:43.365 --> 00:50:47.115
Lord, we've reminded, been reminded,
Lord, that your word does not

00:50:47.115 --> 00:50:50.625
return void, and we know that we can
praise you on earth and in heaven.

00:50:51.135 --> 00:50:56.745
We know that we can praise you
Lord, because of your greatness.

00:50:57.134 --> 00:51:00.464
Because of your power, because of
all the things you've done for us.

00:51:00.464 --> 00:51:03.015
Lord, we have so much to
praise you about, Lord.

00:51:03.015 --> 00:51:06.555
And I just want to remind ourselves,
Lord, today, that if you did not do

00:51:06.555 --> 00:51:10.634
anything else, Lord, that we have enough
to praise you for the rest of our lives.

00:51:11.055 --> 00:51:12.674
So Lord, we are praising you today.

00:51:13.935 --> 00:51:18.674
But Lord, thank you for giving us the
wisdom today through your word and through

00:51:18.674 --> 00:51:23.444
just studying about what worship is and,
and praise Lord that we learned so many

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:24.825
different ways that we can praise you.

00:51:25.995 --> 00:51:29.475
God, don't let us leave here
today and continue on praising the

00:51:29.475 --> 00:51:30.794
same way we've been praising you.

00:51:31.095 --> 00:51:34.365
Lord, let us take something that we
learned today and begin to apply that to

00:51:34.365 --> 00:51:38.564
our lives Lord, so that we can grow closer
to you, so that we can honor you more

00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:43.515
with our lives and Lord, so that we can
be encouraged in our faith as we go and

00:51:43.515 --> 00:51:47.654
pursue relationships with other people to
help them come to faith in you and to be

00:51:47.654 --> 00:51:49.055
able to praise you, Lord, for the first.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.510
There is no person in this room.

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:52.800
There's no person in our city.

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:55.230
There's no person in
each one of our lives.

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:56.790
Lord, that should not praise you.

00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:01.200
Everyone has been called to praise
you and to come to know you.

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:06.540
So as we end today in prayer, as we
end today in worship, Lord, hallelujah.

00:52:06.545 --> 00:52:07.310
Praise God.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.320
May we honor you with our
worship and our praise.

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:11.910
We pray this in your headly name.

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:12.570
Amen.
