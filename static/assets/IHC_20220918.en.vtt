00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.870
I hope you guys have had an amazing week.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.100
Um, as we were talking
earlier, it was a blur.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.910
That's what Brittany mentioned.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.690
Somebody says, how was your week?

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.010
She's like, I don't know it was a blur.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.270
So maybe for you, it was a blur.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.020
Maybe it was a great week.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.420
Maybe it was a slow week, but excited
that you guys have, uh, decided to come

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.010
and worship with us and spend some time.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.970
Um, getting into God's word
because we know that God's

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.280
word never returns void, right?

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.230
God's word never returns void.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.300
I have to remind myself that every time.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.530
And that's why my challenge to you.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.680
If you've got five minutes every day,
even if minimum of five minutes, right.

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:37.800
Obviously go more.

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.920
If you can get in the word, because
when you get in the word, the word gets

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.860
into your heart and then gets into your
life and then comes outta your life.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.190
Right.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.650
And then the more that we enjoy
the word, the more that we learn.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.980
So.

00:00:48.285 --> 00:00:52.845
Today, we're gonna beat in
Psalm one 50, Psalm one 50.

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:53.805
Here's an easy one.

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:56.055
Go to the last page in your Bible.

00:00:56.715 --> 00:00:58.935
And it's the last Psalm in that.

00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:01.905
So it's very, very easy
for you to find it.

00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:06.495
Um, so this is going to set up next week.

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:09.285
So next week we are having a worship.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.390
Service meaning a worship only service.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.350
Um, our family will be
traveling out, um, to St.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.470
Louis to one of our church partners
that brings mission teams out

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.030
here supports us financially.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.030
They've invited us out to their
global missions conference to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.250
share an update about our church
and what God's doing here.

00:01:27.015 --> 00:01:29.265
And to be able to meet some
of their people and kind of

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:30.255
make some connections there.

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:32.835
So in that you guys will
have an opportunity to

00:01:32.835 --> 00:01:34.395
worship together or worship.

00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:37.815
Team's got an amazing day planned
out from prayer to, to worship,

00:01:37.815 --> 00:01:38.985
to reading of God's word.

00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:41.925
So I would say this come
ready to participate in it.

00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:46.245
Um, my encouragement for you, if you
have young kids bring, if you, if

00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:48.525
you know that, Hey, they're normally
in class, cuz we won't have kids

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.855
class, um, bring something to lay
out on the ground, bring some toys.

00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:54.255
Just, I mean that honestly I
tell everybody this, every.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.440
Every week, not just worship Sundays
every week, feel free to literally

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.460
lay something down on the ground.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.430
Some toys in the middle of my
preaching or in the middle of music.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.660
This is family.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.080
So I think if you guys were at my
house, you would do the same thing.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.100
So this is God's house and God would
love for little kids to just kind of roll

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.720
around and play with toys as they need to.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.430
So feel free to come be just
involved in that worship Sunday.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.760
Um, but because of that,
we wanted to talk about.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.500
Worship this week and how, uh, the, the
word of God talks about what worship is.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.799
And, um, I'm, I'm very,
very excited about that.

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.369
And one of the things I just wanna mention
just in this idea of, of where our church

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:36.239
is right now, I believe that God is
doing something unique in our church.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.420
Now you may say you're looking
around going well, it is unique.

00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:44.025
Uniquely smaller right now because there's
some people out because they're sick.

00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:47.685
I would say that God's doing something
unique in each person in our group.

00:02:47.685 --> 00:02:50.655
And I know I, I don't have a personal
connection with each one of you and

00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:52.365
probably know what your day to day is.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:56.865
Uh, but as I continue to just talk
with, uh, see God moving in people's

00:02:56.865 --> 00:03:00.045
lives, uh, be able to pray with him
and encourage them and just, just

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:01.785
see what God's doing in our city.

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:05.805
And some of the, the opportunities
that we have, God is doing some.

00:03:11.085 --> 00:03:12.645
About what God isn't doing.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:13.695
Anybody ever get that way?

00:03:14.245 --> 00:03:17.475
I, I, I love talking about what
God's not doing rather than

00:03:17.475 --> 00:03:18.435
celebrating what God's doing.

00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:20.745
So God is doing some
awesome, awesome things.

00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:26.445
Why.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.329
Is God not revealing to me like
where our next location's gonna be.

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.709
Cuz we're looking for a new space right.

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.799
To worship or you know why this isn't
happening, why that isn't happening.

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.890
I I've I've come to the conclusion
and you may think this is funny that

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.019
it's taking me this long, but usually
I have seasons where I come to the

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.429
conclusion and then I forget it.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.359
Um, the reason why God isn't reveal
that to me, cuz it's none of my concern.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.399
That's his, his concern.

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.100
My concern is what God has given us now
to begin to pour into and to minister.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.730
And if I'll look.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.500
Be amazed that all the opportunities
God has giving us to, to know

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.530
him and to make him known to
know him and to make him known.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.350
And so God is just really
challenging me in that.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.770
Right.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.980
And so when I started thinking about today
about worship, I just wrote down this

00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:15.720
statement, God has already done so much
in my life and in this church that if

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.550
he didn't do one more thing, it would be
enough to praise him the rest of my life.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.030
I'm gonna say that.

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:25.065
God has already done so much
in my life and in this church's

00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:29.354
life that if he didn't do one
more thing, it would be enough to

00:04:29.354 --> 00:04:30.974
praise him for the rest of my life.

00:04:32.174 --> 00:04:37.215
See, that's a challenging statement
to say, because, you know, we, we

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:43.145
all like more and I think at times
God's challenging us to, to stop

00:04:44.294 --> 00:04:46.335
and praise him for what he has done.

00:04:47.265 --> 00:04:47.534
Right.

00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:48.315
Praise him for what he.

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:50.354
Here's the thing that's so cool.

00:04:50.354 --> 00:04:54.825
If you read God's word and you know,
God's heart, God's not done, right.

00:04:54.825 --> 00:04:55.755
We've been talking about this.

00:04:55.755 --> 00:04:57.284
We've actually got some shirts
that we're making, talking about.

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:58.365
God's not done with you.

00:04:58.455 --> 00:04:59.625
He's not done with me.

00:04:59.685 --> 00:05:00.945
He's not done with us.

00:05:00.945 --> 00:05:02.145
He's not done with this.

00:05:02.145 --> 00:05:02.955
What does that mean?

00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:07.724
God's not done working in any of
our lives, so it's not that God's

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.405
saying, Hey, stay where you are.

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:10.784
Don't move.

00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:12.914
What he's saying is enjoy the journey.

00:05:14.085 --> 00:05:15.585
Don't forget what God has done for you.

00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:16.815
Celebrate where you.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.870
We know God desires to see more and more
people come to faith in Christ to use

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.330
you to change people's lives, but that's
not a burden for you to bear that's

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.400
his, but that doesn't discount that
God desires to do more and more in us.

00:05:32.405 --> 00:05:33.660
And so we get to worship through it.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.930
So we're gonna talk more and more
about that today, and I love it.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.320
Right.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.450
So I kind of wanna set this up right.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.680
As we talk about worship, and now we
talk about Jesus' worthy of our worship.

00:05:44.235 --> 00:05:44.985
What is worship.

00:05:44.985 --> 00:05:47.595
So I wanna start there because I'd
love to get some feedback from you.

00:05:47.775 --> 00:05:50.745
If somebody was to walk up to you
and they say, Hey, what is worship?

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:52.065
How would you respond?

00:05:52.065 --> 00:05:52.815
What would be your answer?

00:05:56.715 --> 00:05:57.525
What is worship?

00:05:58.785 --> 00:06:00.345
Praising God, what else?

00:06:03.615 --> 00:06:07.375
What is worship singing?

00:06:07.755 --> 00:06:08.175
Okay.

00:06:08.325 --> 00:06:08.925
What else?

00:06:12.015 --> 00:06:13.065
Spending time with him.

00:06:13.065 --> 00:06:13.725
What else?

00:06:18.675 --> 00:06:19.365
Reading your Bible.

00:06:19.365 --> 00:06:19.755
What else?

00:06:20.985 --> 00:06:21.795
Focusing on him.

00:06:21.855 --> 00:06:22.495
Anything else?

00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:23.985
Serving?

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:29.535
See there's many aspects of worship.

00:06:30.045 --> 00:06:30.585
Let's give you a few.

00:06:30.585 --> 00:06:33.135
I wrote down and you guys
were obviously right spot on.

00:06:33.135 --> 00:06:33.435
Right?

00:06:33.795 --> 00:06:36.705
When we worship, we're doing it to
honor and show reverence to God.

00:06:37.935 --> 00:06:42.195
When we worship, we're giving
our entire self, our thoughts

00:06:42.195 --> 00:06:43.425
and our emotions to God.

00:06:44.895 --> 00:06:51.945
When we worship it's in response to
what God has done will do in your life

00:06:51.975 --> 00:06:53.145
and in the lives of those around you.

00:06:54.105 --> 00:06:59.125
See, we live in a world that spends
a lot of time worshiping, right?

00:07:00.195 --> 00:07:04.545
But we, we find that we also live in
a church culture where we spend a lot

00:07:04.545 --> 00:07:06.285
of time worshiping other things than.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.980
So, let me just jump out there, give
a great example of something that I

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:17.190
dealt with in my life and not a great
example of worship in a good way, but

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.600
a great example of what worship was.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.060
So whenever I give my life to
Christ and Brit will remember

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.170
this, we're a young family.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.570
Um, and I spent the
majority of my weekends.

00:07:24.575 --> 00:07:25.980
Let me tell you what the majority
of my weekends look like.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.820
Saturday was college football OU
I watched college football a day.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.750
Then it was Sunday morning.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.280
It was NASCAR Sunday, a.

00:07:33.135 --> 00:07:34.455
And some NFL football.

00:07:34.484 --> 00:07:37.244
And then Monday night was
obviously an NFL football and I

00:07:37.455 --> 00:07:39.195
like lived and died by sports.

00:07:39.765 --> 00:07:42.554
I worshiped sports.

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:45.044
It was high on my priority.

00:07:45.104 --> 00:07:46.784
I had emotional highs and lows.

00:07:46.994 --> 00:07:48.405
I screamed out loud.

00:07:48.405 --> 00:07:54.195
I celebrated, you know, I sometimes
bowed down because I was so frustrated.

00:07:54.195 --> 00:07:55.304
Like you name it right.

00:07:55.304 --> 00:07:57.315
I loved sports.

00:07:57.554 --> 00:07:58.664
It consumed me.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.700
When I gave my life to Christ,
God began to weed things out.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.450
And so, you know, I'm actually wearing
an OU shirt today, so go sinners, right.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.220
Channing's wearing a Dallas cowboy shirt.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.360
So we love sports still.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:15.810
But in the process of worshiping the
Lord in my life, I begin to realize

00:08:15.815 --> 00:08:17.340
there was something different.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.170
See Saturdays, Sunday mornings,
which ended up being at church.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.400
Then whenever I get my life, my Christ.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.860
So I was missing some
things or Sunday afternoons.

00:08:26.474 --> 00:08:29.685
I tended to get more excited
about worshiping sports

00:08:29.685 --> 00:08:30.585
than I did about the Lord.

00:08:31.185 --> 00:08:32.804
And I thought something's wrong.

00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:34.725
I'm missing something.

00:08:34.725 --> 00:08:35.054
Right.

00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:40.814
And when I realized that, man,
Jesus is worthy of our worship,

00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:44.444
that it started changing in my life.

00:08:44.444 --> 00:08:44.805
Right.

00:08:45.735 --> 00:08:49.635
I could go to church on Sundays and
stand there with my hands in the pocket.

00:08:50.595 --> 00:08:53.385
Wondering why he's singing one more verse.

00:08:54.089 --> 00:08:55.650
The same verse over and over again.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.370
I just wanna sit down.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.060
My legs are hurting.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.500
When, if I went to know you game,
you would never sit down and

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.489
you would never stop cheering.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.630
That didn't bother me.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.140
I didn't say man, why don't
the game get less interesting.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.750
So I can sit down in my
seat and go home early.

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:11.969
No, we wanted to go into overtime.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:12.819
Right?

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.680
So when I started thinking through
that, I started being convicted because

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.079
I cared more and I celebrated more.

00:09:19.469 --> 00:09:22.770
When, when OU scored a touchdown
than whenever Jesus changed my.

00:09:23.985 --> 00:09:28.785
See, I knew how to worship well, but
I was not worshiping the right thing.

00:09:29.355 --> 00:09:29.505
Right.

00:09:29.505 --> 00:09:30.675
So something had to change.

00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:35.385
And so my heart began to grow, grow
stronger with the Lord and my emotional

00:09:35.385 --> 00:09:36.735
rollercoaster and Brittney owes this.

00:09:36.735 --> 00:09:39.675
If OU lost on a Saturday,
I was mad for three days.

00:09:40.815 --> 00:09:41.595
I was mad.

00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:44.505
I was grumpy and I mean,
that's stupid guys.

00:09:44.505 --> 00:09:46.815
It's stupid, but that was me.

00:09:47.805 --> 00:09:48.675
So that began to change.

00:09:48.675 --> 00:09:49.425
And so now.

00:09:49.965 --> 00:09:51.615
I can watch, literally
Brittney knows this.

00:09:51.615 --> 00:09:52.725
I can watch it or not watch it.

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:54.255
You gave my love to, I
watched somebody yesterday.

00:09:54.465 --> 00:09:55.245
It was half time.

00:09:55.245 --> 00:09:56.505
We didn't get to watch
half the game yesterday.

00:09:56.564 --> 00:09:57.285
I didn't cried.

00:09:57.285 --> 00:09:58.005
Didn't complain.

00:09:58.965 --> 00:09:59.355
Didn't matter.

00:09:59.415 --> 00:10:02.985
And if they would've lost yesterday
to Nebraska, I wouldn't have cared.

00:10:03.015 --> 00:10:03.735
I could have slept.

00:10:04.155 --> 00:10:08.175
But in the past, I couldn't why,
because my heart changed because I

00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:11.175
cared more about my worship to the
Lord and, and my relationship with

00:10:11.175 --> 00:10:13.875
the Lord and my relationship with
my family and, and who Christ was

00:10:13.875 --> 00:10:15.314
in my life than I was about sports.

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:18.285
And that's, again, a great example
of what worship is, but in the

00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:20.115
wrong way, why do I bring this up?

00:10:20.385 --> 00:10:25.604
Because we all worship something,
whether we know it or not, you

00:10:25.604 --> 00:10:27.104
begin to place things in our lives.

00:10:27.104 --> 00:10:31.334
And I hope, and I pray that it's God
in your life, but for some of us.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.380
It's our family for some of us,
it's our job for some of us.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.540
It's our work for some of us.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:42.300
It's, you know, sports or food, you
name it, you place it in what'd you say

00:10:42.449 --> 00:10:47.699
kids, we worship them so much that we
focus so much on them, that we take out

00:10:47.704 --> 00:10:50.400
the opportunity for worship for God.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.819
I hope today that you'll learn
a little bit more as I did.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:57.420
And as I jumped into the Psalm
Psalm one 50 of how the Psalmist

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.490
challenges us to worship.

00:11:00.735 --> 00:11:04.665
I hope that you worship differently
because of what you'll learn today.

00:11:04.845 --> 00:11:09.045
So let's look at this Psalm one 15,
if you found your place, say amen.

00:11:10.125 --> 00:11:11.025
All right, awesome.

00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:11.565
Let's go.

00:11:11.565 --> 00:11:15.735
So it says this hallelujah,
praise God in his sanctuary,

00:11:15.735 --> 00:11:17.715
praise him in his mighty expanse.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.005
Praise him for his powerful acts.

00:11:20.115 --> 00:11:21.845
Praise him for his abundant.

00:11:21.845 --> 00:11:23.005
Great, great.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:28.199
Praise him with the trumpet blast,
praise him with a harp and Allier praise

00:11:28.199 --> 00:11:29.729
him with the tambourine and dance.

00:11:29.969 --> 00:11:31.619
Praise him with strings and flute.

00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:33.900
Praise him with resounding symbols.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.060
Praise him with clashing symbols.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.329
Let everything that breathes.

00:11:39.569 --> 00:11:40.500
Praise the Lord.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.520
Hallelujah.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:42.599
Let's pray.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.380
Lord Jesus.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.130
We pray that your word will not return
void today, and that will be changed

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.469
and transformed into more and more like.

00:11:50.925 --> 00:11:54.314
Where our hearts are worshiping you
and you alone and that everything

00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:57.314
else PEs in comparison, Lord, we
pray this in your heaven name.

00:11:58.214 --> 00:11:58.605
Amen.

00:11:59.505 --> 00:11:59.745
Amen.

00:11:59.745 --> 00:12:02.415
So the one things that we'll
see here right off the bat, and

00:12:02.415 --> 00:12:04.905
I love this is the first line.

00:12:04.905 --> 00:12:05.564
Hallelujah.

00:12:06.315 --> 00:12:08.985
See I think about this whenever
I think about hallelujah.

00:12:08.985 --> 00:12:12.525
I think about when I was in Africa, I
used to go on a lot of mission trips to

00:12:12.525 --> 00:12:13.785
Africa when I was at my pastor church.

00:12:13.785 --> 00:12:16.755
And when we go there, they would
gather a group of people up.

00:12:16.755 --> 00:12:18.585
And that was the first thing they
would get to get their attention.

00:12:18.585 --> 00:12:20.475
They would say hallelujah,
and everybody would say, amen.

00:12:20.835 --> 00:12:21.645
And then they would say, amen.

00:12:21.645 --> 00:12:22.365
And you'd say, hallelujah.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:28.635
And it was, it was kind of a call to
the service, a call to worship a call.

00:12:29.325 --> 00:12:30.585
To focus on Jesus.

00:12:30.855 --> 00:12:34.965
See, when we look at the word,
hallelujah, is, is really transferred or

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.845
translated into God, be praised, right?

00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:42.075
It's utter and worship as
an expression of rejoicing.

00:12:42.915 --> 00:12:45.975
So whenever I think about
hallelujah, it is a call to worship.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:46.995
That's what this almost was doing.

00:12:47.085 --> 00:12:51.615
He was calling the people as he's
writing this to worship or to praise.

00:12:52.995 --> 00:12:56.685
I think about this, like in this
moment, it's like everybody listen up.

00:12:56.775 --> 00:12:58.125
Hey, praise the Lord.

00:12:58.215 --> 00:12:59.415
God has changed my life.

00:12:59.415 --> 00:13:01.515
Everybody come near let's praise the Lord.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.835
God has changed your life.

00:13:03.105 --> 00:13:05.595
Come on, praise the Lord.

00:13:08.175 --> 00:13:10.365
Why can we say hallelujah?

00:13:10.815 --> 00:13:13.545
Because God has changed our lives.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.565
Praise the Lord.

00:13:15.615 --> 00:13:19.785
And in this call to worship or praise
the reader and the writer of this

00:13:19.785 --> 00:13:21.315
actually, and the reader of a us.

00:13:22.335 --> 00:13:24.795
Should realize that
this is all about Jesus.

00:13:24.795 --> 00:13:26.475
This is all about God, right?

00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:30.885
It's not focused on what this person
gets out of worship, but really in the

00:13:30.885 --> 00:13:33.015
fact of what, who we're worshiping.

00:13:33.015 --> 00:13:33.375
Right.

00:13:33.405 --> 00:13:36.135
And it's putting all the
focus on what God has done.

00:13:36.795 --> 00:13:37.155
Right.

00:13:37.305 --> 00:13:41.745
So true worship puts all the focus
on Jesus and not on ourselves.

00:13:42.135 --> 00:13:46.815
So this Psalm starts off with
hallelujah, praise the Lord, right?

00:13:46.815 --> 00:13:47.685
God be praised.

00:13:47.955 --> 00:13:49.335
And it ends with hallelujah.

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:50.325
God be praise.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.520
So let's jump in and we're gonna
answer a couple of questions.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.680
Number one, the Psalmus tells
us where we should praise God,

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.700
where we should praise God.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.960
And we see this in the first verse.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.680
He says, praise God in his sanctuary
and praise him in his mighty expanse.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.710
So when we look at this, the Selmi is
saying, praise God in his sanctuary.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.380
In that time, obviously in the Selma God.

00:14:13.905 --> 00:14:16.694
Its presence was in the
temple or in the sanctuary.

00:14:16.694 --> 00:14:20.444
So people would come to the temple
and they would praise the Lord there.

00:14:21.225 --> 00:14:24.495
So somebody told me this, what
has changed since the time of

00:14:24.495 --> 00:14:27.795
this Psalmist writing this, right?

00:14:28.305 --> 00:14:30.165
Where is God's presence now?

00:14:33.375 --> 00:14:34.765
Us everywhere.

00:14:35.175 --> 00:14:36.705
God's everywhere we are.

00:14:36.825 --> 00:14:38.595
That's everywhere in creation.

00:14:38.595 --> 00:14:41.895
Now we understand that God's
presence is every, so I love this.

00:14:41.895 --> 00:14:42.485
When we look at.

00:14:43.065 --> 00:14:46.875
He's really challenging us that if
we're reading this text, this, he

00:14:46.875 --> 00:14:52.245
says, praise God on earth because
God's presence is everywhere.

00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:54.195
His presence is in us.

00:14:54.405 --> 00:14:58.605
And so when he says that there's no
place, guys, there's no place that

00:14:58.605 --> 00:15:01.605
God should not be praised no place.

00:15:01.815 --> 00:15:04.335
It's not just Sunday morning.

00:15:04.335 --> 00:15:05.265
And this is why I want us.

00:15:05.385 --> 00:15:09.825
It's so clear if we read this as
it sets, you guys would say this.

00:15:10.185 --> 00:15:11.685
Yeah, we, we come every Sunday.

00:15:12.075 --> 00:15:14.985
They play instruments and we praise check.

00:15:16.245 --> 00:15:20.925
But now we see this in the way that
God has transformed his presence

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.995
in our lives, in everything we do.

00:15:23.085 --> 00:15:27.675
And the Soma says, praise God,
everywhere, everywhere you are.

00:15:27.915 --> 00:15:28.575
So think about this.

00:15:28.575 --> 00:15:30.915
You're in your car, you're in your house.

00:15:31.755 --> 00:15:32.715
You're around family.

00:15:33.045 --> 00:15:33.885
You're at work.

00:15:34.395 --> 00:15:35.235
You're eating dinner.

00:15:35.715 --> 00:15:37.635
You're obviously at church, right?

00:15:37.695 --> 00:15:41.085
You're in your small group,
but you can praise God every.

00:15:41.955 --> 00:15:44.475
Because there's no place that
we cannot have praise God.

00:15:44.865 --> 00:15:50.525
I challenge you to think on this
guys when we realize how precious

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:56.955
something is, we, we typically
take it and we, we honor it more.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:02.025
We, we, we cherish it more,
but we live in a world.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.685
I say a world, but we really
live in, in, in, in a nation that

00:16:05.685 --> 00:16:10.025
actually allows us to praise God
everywhere and to worship God every.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:15.390
There's so many countries where if the
name of Jesus is praised or spoke about

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.640
they would be killed or persecuted.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.780
And we aren't.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.569
So at times as a church, we say our, we
save our praising for Sunday mornings,

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.870
the sanctuary, we read this Psalm
straight up and we say, yep, sanctuary.

00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:32.340
That's all we got, but God is challenging
us to praise even without music.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.600
So you understand this, it doesn't
take just music to praise the

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.340
Lord or to worship the Lord.

00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:40.905
So we can praise God every.

00:16:42.465 --> 00:16:43.815
But then he challenges us, right?

00:16:43.875 --> 00:16:44.655
This is the cool part.

00:16:44.655 --> 00:16:45.705
This is where he kinda gets up here.

00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:45.915
Right?

00:16:45.915 --> 00:16:48.645
He says, praise him in his mighty expanse.

00:16:48.975 --> 00:16:52.875
This idea is, is the idea of praising
him in heaven or praising him

00:16:52.875 --> 00:16:58.215
beyond our understanding because
his power and his glory is mighty.

00:16:58.365 --> 00:17:01.285
It's vast, it's bright, it's powerful.

00:17:01.285 --> 00:17:02.925
It influences the whole earth.

00:17:03.175 --> 00:17:06.165
So basically he's saying praise
God in heaven, because of

00:17:06.165 --> 00:17:08.325
all he has done all, he will.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.960
There is no place that is ever created
that we should not praise the Lord.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.650
And here's the thing.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:19.540
If you don't like praise you better not
go to heaven, cuz we're gonna spend the

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.520
rest of our lives, praising the Lord and,
and I'm telling you so, so, you know, I

00:17:24.525 --> 00:17:30.400
understand this is not a knock to anybody
that doesn't want to praise in service.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.000
You don't have a good voice or you.

00:17:35.235 --> 00:17:37.215
You got a deep voice and
you don't sing louder.

00:17:37.455 --> 00:17:39.135
You're just not, you're very introverted.

00:17:39.135 --> 00:17:39.675
I get this.

00:17:39.675 --> 00:17:41.355
So that's not like to
knock on you on that.

00:17:41.355 --> 00:17:44.295
Cuz I get that it's uncomfortable
sometimes to praise in a group.

00:17:44.745 --> 00:17:48.555
But I would say this, this challenge
today is for us to recognize

00:17:48.825 --> 00:17:51.285
when something is so precious.

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:57.165
We recognize it by celebrating
it and giving praise and honor,

00:17:57.165 --> 00:18:02.145
and God has done so much for us
that if he did not do one more.

00:18:03.225 --> 00:18:03.705
He's worthy.

00:18:03.705 --> 00:18:06.105
We praise the rest of our
lives, no matter where we are.

00:18:06.465 --> 00:18:08.145
That's the challenge that we see here.

00:18:08.145 --> 00:18:08.505
Right?

00:18:08.865 --> 00:18:11.265
So the first thing we learn
is where we should praise God

00:18:11.265 --> 00:18:12.825
and ultimately everywhere.

00:18:12.975 --> 00:18:13.755
That's simple.

00:18:14.085 --> 00:18:14.325
Right?

00:18:14.325 --> 00:18:16.455
You can't find a place that you can't
praise him or you shouldn't praise him.

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:21.105
Number two, right in verse two,
what should we praise him for?

00:18:21.415 --> 00:18:21.975
Right.

00:18:22.245 --> 00:18:24.225
We can praise him anywhere,
but if I don't have a reason

00:18:24.225 --> 00:18:25.365
to praise God, I won't do it.

00:18:26.415 --> 00:18:27.015
I just won't do it.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:27.405
Right.

00:18:27.795 --> 00:18:30.255
So sometimes we need to know the reason.

00:18:31.155 --> 00:18:33.255
We should praise the Lord or
desire to praise the Lord.

00:18:33.315 --> 00:18:38.265
And so he says this in his word,
praise him for his powerful acts,

00:18:38.565 --> 00:18:42.045
praise him for his abundant greatness.

00:18:42.075 --> 00:18:45.675
I love this, the word
powerful and abundant.

00:18:46.545 --> 00:18:49.935
It just, it speaks of
all that God has done.

00:18:50.595 --> 00:18:53.175
He doesn't say, you know, praise
him for the small things that he's

00:18:53.175 --> 00:18:57.135
done and the occasional things and
the, you know, the okay things.

00:18:57.554 --> 00:19:02.534
He says, these are powerful acts
and these are abundant things.

00:19:03.014 --> 00:19:05.985
It's so easy to forget as I
was talking about earlier.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.445
So easy to forget all that God has done.

00:19:08.445 --> 00:19:09.885
I just want us to start
from the beginning.

00:19:09.885 --> 00:19:12.975
I'm not gonna just go a long, long
ways with this, but if you just use

00:19:13.215 --> 00:19:17.625
God's word and you get into God's
word and you begin to think this

00:19:17.804 --> 00:19:23.395
what powerful acts and what abundant
greatness did God do read Genesis.

00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:26.085
God created the heavens and the.

00:19:27.015 --> 00:19:31.575
He created everything, the water
and the trees and the food and the

00:19:31.575 --> 00:19:36.675
animals and his greatest creation
is you like, just stop there.

00:19:36.735 --> 00:19:37.605
And we got enough.

00:19:38.129 --> 00:19:42.690
To praise the Lord forward because
he is great and powerful, but then it

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:46.800
goes on God desired to have a personal
relationship with, with his creation.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.840
And so he did until obviously our sin
broke that, but God still pursued us so

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.919
much that you see in the word of God,
in the old Testament that he pursued

00:19:55.925 --> 00:20:00.000
the people in slavery, he brought them
up outta slavery and he showed so many

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.740
mighty acts to give them the promise land.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.070
Then even when they messed up
again, he brought them back.

00:20:05.395 --> 00:20:06.295
Gave them a king.

00:20:06.385 --> 00:20:08.995
And whenever that messed up,
he still brought them back

00:20:08.995 --> 00:20:10.495
again and he forgave them.

00:20:10.495 --> 00:20:13.585
And then if we wanna go in the
new Testament, he sent his son

00:20:13.585 --> 00:20:16.075
Jesus, because of his greatness.

00:20:16.075 --> 00:20:19.855
He could bring God into the
flesh, live a perfect life.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:26.129
To show what love and grace and
mercy and patience and goodness and

00:20:26.129 --> 00:20:29.790
kindness and all these things that
we get to see in the life of Jesus.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.159
God gave us that then not only did he
give us that in the flesh, he says, no.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.639
I'm not gonna judge you for your sins
and your fondness, your brokenness.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.280
I'm going to judge my son,
my perfect son for you.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.560
God's power is great because he chose to
take the punishment we deserved and place

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.080
it on his son in which he sent for us.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.560
God's power God's greatness.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.370
God has done so many things
just when we look at the word of

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.080
God, he is worthy to be praised.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:20:59.440
Amen.

00:20:59.889 --> 00:21:03.820
He is worthy to be praised that's enough.

00:21:05.415 --> 00:21:09.525
This is the question I want to ask
now, what has God done for you?

00:21:10.004 --> 00:21:13.725
Because I'm telling you at times when
you see God do something for somebody

00:21:13.725 --> 00:21:17.895
else, it just doesn't hit sometimes
where we need it to hit, because

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.945
we're like, but that was for them.

00:21:19.185 --> 00:21:20.385
That was in the old Testament.

00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:21.735
That was in the new Testament.

00:21:21.885 --> 00:21:23.415
That was 2000 years ago.

00:21:23.595 --> 00:21:24.825
What's God done for me?

00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:28.605
Well, I know this I've been around enough
of you long enough that you got something.

00:21:29.054 --> 00:21:30.675
To praise God for that.

00:21:30.675 --> 00:21:35.504
He has been great and he has done
abundant and he has been powerful.

00:21:35.685 --> 00:21:36.915
So why don't we share some of those?

00:21:36.915 --> 00:21:38.745
What has God done for you?

00:21:38.925 --> 00:21:45.375
That we can praise the
Lord about your turn life?

00:21:45.375 --> 00:21:47.355
Just being able to breathe and exist.

00:21:47.594 --> 00:21:47.925
Amen.

00:21:47.925 --> 00:21:48.495
What else?

00:21:49.544 --> 00:21:50.504
He's faithful.

00:21:51.225 --> 00:21:51.645
Amen.

00:21:51.675 --> 00:21:52.365
What else?

00:21:53.955 --> 00:21:54.165
Hmm.

00:21:55.274 --> 00:21:55.875
Family.

00:21:55.905 --> 00:21:57.225
Yes, God has provided family.

00:21:57.225 --> 00:21:57.794
What else?

00:21:59.189 --> 00:21:59.970
Beating cancer.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:00.570
Amen.

00:22:00.689 --> 00:22:01.439
Praise God.

00:22:01.439 --> 00:22:01.770
Yeah.

00:22:02.699 --> 00:22:03.449
What else?

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.220
Food.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.330
See, you're just gonna go
down the list, sleep sugar.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:09.750
Okay.

00:22:10.169 --> 00:22:12.330
Thank you, Lord preachy.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:12.990
Jesus.

00:22:13.919 --> 00:22:14.189
All right.

00:22:14.189 --> 00:22:14.820
What else?

00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:16.610
Forgiveness.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.449
Oh, man, I need that purpose.

00:22:19.629 --> 00:22:20.050
Yes.

00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:21.330
Yes.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.590
What else?

00:22:23.699 --> 00:22:24.570
Salvation.

00:22:25.409 --> 00:22:26.879
Hope let's keep going.

00:22:26.879 --> 00:22:27.209
Joy.

00:22:32.225 --> 00:22:33.435
Community's keep going.

00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:36.524
What can you praise the Lord about coffee?

00:22:36.945 --> 00:22:37.725
Yes.

00:22:38.834 --> 00:22:40.185
And parents who will buy it for you?

00:22:41.084 --> 00:22:42.014
Salvation.

00:22:42.254 --> 00:22:42.794
Yes.

00:22:43.094 --> 00:22:43.784
Peace.

00:22:44.324 --> 00:22:48.104
What is long suffering?

00:22:48.195 --> 00:22:48.794
Oh man.

00:22:49.675 --> 00:22:50.235
Music.

00:22:50.715 --> 00:22:51.405
Holy spirit.

00:22:53.175 --> 00:22:53.925
Anything else?

00:22:54.675 --> 00:22:55.754
What can you praise the Lord?

00:22:58.169 --> 00:22:59.100
Inspiring hope church.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.490
Amen.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.949
This community of people
guys brought together.

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.610
Amen.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:06.840
Because I think, and this is the
cool part and I, and I'm so glad

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.070
you guys participated in this.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.820
I think we could continue to go on and,
and, and we could continue to dive a

00:23:11.824 --> 00:23:15.810
little bit deeper because what I would
say is majority, not all majority of

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.030
these were very like surface level.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.730
So as you start thinking about diving
a little bit deeper, I'm gonna give you

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.139
some stories where I can praise the.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.550
And I want you to think of
those stories in your life.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.080
And I want you to praise
the Lord for those two.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:35.100
So I think about this guys,
despite the difficulties that

00:23:35.105 --> 00:23:36.690
I went through as a child.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.840
And, and there's a long story that
some of you heard, some of you haven't,

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:45.240
I was still able to find hope and
help in Jesus, despite those things

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.960
from unforgiveness that I had to
selfishness that I had as, as I was

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.910
getting to an adult and as the greed
that I had in my life, I'm so thankful.

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:57.389
That the Lord was powerful enough to
bring me outta those circumstances

00:23:57.389 --> 00:23:59.310
and those situations to save me.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.879
I start thinking about my marriage
and my four wonderful kids.

00:24:02.885 --> 00:24:05.040
And, and there's no reason
I'm just telling you.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.700
There's some things again, that
everybody doesn't fully understand,

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.639
but our marriage is, is today.

00:24:11.645 --> 00:24:16.770
What it is because God saved that marriage
through saving me and changing our

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.690
family by bringing Jesus into our life.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.230
We had the kids in our
life because God save.

00:24:23.085 --> 00:24:25.305
Our family and he showed up in our family.

00:24:25.935 --> 00:24:28.215
See, here's a, a, a, a personal story.

00:24:28.275 --> 00:24:30.975
And again, you guys have probably heard
some of you heard this, but Teagan's story

00:24:31.335 --> 00:24:36.315
when Tegan literally she had lung issues
right after birth and God saved her.

00:24:36.915 --> 00:24:39.435
And we still, to this day,
we don't wanna take that for

00:24:39.435 --> 00:24:41.475
granted because God showed up.

00:24:41.475 --> 00:24:44.145
We have a lot to praise God
for I'll just tell you this.

00:24:44.355 --> 00:24:49.095
God has provided job after job
financial, Providence time after time.

00:24:49.095 --> 00:24:50.775
No, I'm not rich my bank.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.285
Account's not.

00:24:52.245 --> 00:24:55.065
But it seemed like every single
time that our family had a need,

00:24:55.275 --> 00:24:57.285
God provided for that need.

00:24:57.285 --> 00:24:59.985
And as I think back, God is powerful.

00:25:00.225 --> 00:25:01.335
God is good.

00:25:01.605 --> 00:25:04.155
His greatness is amazing.

00:25:04.815 --> 00:25:06.255
Then I think about this church.

00:25:06.615 --> 00:25:09.945
And all the people in here and how
God brought each one of you into this

00:25:09.945 --> 00:25:11.955
story and he's transformed your life.

00:25:11.985 --> 00:25:15.945
And he's used you in the situations
he's used you and he has used you.

00:25:15.945 --> 00:25:19.065
So, you know, from a personal temple
in our family to bless us and to

00:25:19.065 --> 00:25:24.195
love on us and to support us and to
encourage us as a family, God is good.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:29.790
When I think of these things guys,
and I start actually listing out where

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:35.070
God has shown up powerfully, where he
has shown abundant things in my life.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:35.880
Oh my gosh.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:42.180
Praise be to God, but you are as
much the struggle that I have.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.610
I asked the question, what
have you done for me lately?

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:47.280
And, and we're here in a moment.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.580
We're gonna get to talk about the
different words in Hebrew appraise,

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.470
and you're gonna love this because
man, it just transformed my.

00:25:54.315 --> 00:25:59.355
But I, I tend to get caught up in only
praising God for what he's done for me

00:25:59.355 --> 00:26:03.855
lately and complaining to God about what
he's not done for me lately as well.

00:26:04.395 --> 00:26:07.465
And then this is just transforming
my heart and I hope it transforms

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.764
your heart and what praise is.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:10.264
Right.

00:26:10.935 --> 00:26:15.315
We can look at this and we can say,
hallelujah, praise God everywhere.

00:26:15.585 --> 00:26:18.585
And for everything, God
is worthy to be praised.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:20.910
He talks about that, right?

00:26:20.915 --> 00:26:25.080
That we can praise God everywhere and we
can praise God for everything he's done.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.380
But then he says, how
should we praise him?

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:32.700
And I'm gonna expand on this because
he's going to use one specific

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.190
angle of, of, of worship or praise.

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.080
And he's gonna talk about
these instruments, right?

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:40.500
He speaks directly to this and he says
this, praise him with the trumpet,

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:45.360
blast, praise him with the harp and a li
praise him with the tambourine and dance.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.620
Praise him with strings and.

00:26:47.295 --> 00:26:48.945
Praise him with resounding symbols.

00:26:49.245 --> 00:26:53.445
After I read this, I called up Matt,
Amanda, Laura Orville everybody's on tech

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:54.975
team said we gotta change instruments.

00:26:55.275 --> 00:26:56.085
We're doing it wrong.

00:26:56.955 --> 00:26:59.835
They laughed and said,
eh, we've progressed.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.165
Okay.

00:27:00.225 --> 00:27:00.765
So, okay.

00:27:00.765 --> 00:27:01.245
I see it.

00:27:01.365 --> 00:27:01.905
It's okay.

00:27:02.745 --> 00:27:06.765
But really what he's saying here
is this is a type of worship or

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:11.175
praise that included instruments
that would be created to praise God.

00:27:11.295 --> 00:27:11.655
Right?

00:27:11.895 --> 00:27:14.745
Obviously we've seen them adapt
and change, but I wanna take some.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.470
To talk about multiple ways that we can
praise God, not just with instruments.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.830
Right?

00:27:20.129 --> 00:27:22.710
And so in doing research cool
part again, this isn't on me.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.870
This is on what God
does in his Providence.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.240
I, I, I found an article talking about
seven Hebrew words for praise or worship.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.149
I wanna talk about this and, and
PEY and Chan are actually gonna

00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:34.020
go hand these out to you guys.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.480
Cause I want you to see these
copies and you can have, why

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.320
don't you guys start doing that?

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.530
You start handing those out to
everybody, um, start with one per family.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.470
And when you get done, go back
around and give extras to every.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:45.420
Cause I think we have enough.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.820
I think I printed off like
20 something, but just start

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:48.750
passing 'em out and we'll see.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.320
Here's what I want you to think about
as we talk about these words of praise.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.460
How many of all in the same
sentence said, man, I love my

00:27:56.465 --> 00:27:57.870
wife and I love cheeseburgers.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:00.930
Okay.

00:28:00.935 --> 00:28:02.040
Maybe or husband.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.090
Hey, there we go.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.020
Dave's got me.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:04.680
Thanks, Dave.

00:28:04.685 --> 00:28:05.120
Okay.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.810
We, we used the word love
in the same sentence.

00:28:10.695 --> 00:28:12.585
Do we really mean the same thing, honey?

00:28:12.645 --> 00:28:14.295
I'm pretty sure I love you
more than a cheeseburger.

00:28:15.825 --> 00:28:17.085
Okay, exactly.

00:28:17.355 --> 00:28:20.985
So what I would mean by that
in our English words, we

00:28:20.985 --> 00:28:22.395
sometimes don't differentiate.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.335
Now we understand when I use the word love
for cheeseburgers and love for my wife,

00:28:25.335 --> 00:28:32.175
you guys know what that means, but at
times we don't really communicate that.

00:28:32.175 --> 00:28:32.505
Right.

00:28:32.715 --> 00:28:36.165
And so when we read in God's
word and we see the word praise.

00:28:37.425 --> 00:28:39.735
We see the word worship, but most of
the time it's translated praise, right?

00:28:39.855 --> 00:28:41.535
Praise, we think, oh, it's just praise.

00:28:41.535 --> 00:28:46.065
So it's one way of praise, but
there's actually multiple ways that

00:28:46.065 --> 00:28:49.665
these words are translated and you're
gonna love this because it's changed

00:28:49.665 --> 00:28:51.195
me as I begin to read over this.

00:28:51.495 --> 00:28:54.375
So we're gonna walk through this
together and we're gonna see

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.845
these different words, a praise.

00:28:55.845 --> 00:28:58.935
And so starting there again,
this is from AGLO international

00:28:58.995 --> 00:29:00.825
seven Hebrew words for praise.

00:29:01.155 --> 00:29:02.235
We're gonna watch through each one.

00:29:02.235 --> 00:29:04.785
And if I don't say the Hebrew
word correctly, just forgive me.

00:29:04.815 --> 00:29:05.115
Okay.

00:29:05.715 --> 00:29:07.455
The first one is halal.

00:29:07.905 --> 00:29:11.985
It says it is a primary Hebrew
root root word for praise.

00:29:12.165 --> 00:29:12.435
Right?

00:29:12.435 --> 00:29:15.705
Our word for hallelujah
comes from this base word.

00:29:16.065 --> 00:29:20.835
It means to be clear to praise, to shine,
to boast, to show, to RA, to celebrate.

00:29:22.125 --> 00:29:23.925
So I'm gonna have you guys participate.

00:29:24.135 --> 00:29:24.824
Who wants to read?

00:29:24.824 --> 00:29:26.504
I just want, we're just gonna read
one verse out of each one of these

00:29:26.504 --> 00:29:28.695
sections who wants to read that
first verse it's listed on the paper.

00:29:28.695 --> 00:29:30.225
There's Psalm 1 13, 1 through three.

00:29:30.314 --> 00:29:32.205
And don't you say the
word and parenthesis.

00:29:32.205 --> 00:29:33.855
That's just what that word praise means.

00:29:34.185 --> 00:29:35.235
Who wants to say Elisa?

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:35.445
Go ahead.

00:29:42.685 --> 00:29:47.594
So when we look at this word,
this is an invitation to worship.

00:29:48.689 --> 00:29:49.679
This is to praise.

00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:55.649
And, and so you guys know each week, our
worship team is teaching you to halal.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.709
They are inviting you to worship,
to praise, to, to invite you in,

00:30:01.709 --> 00:30:05.669
to praise the Lord, to shine and
to, to show the magnitude of God.

00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:12.540
And so when they worship, they are shining
the light of Jesus for the world to.

00:30:13.379 --> 00:30:15.510
So a lot of times we're doing
this on Sunday, so that's just

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.949
a great example of Sunday.

00:30:16.949 --> 00:30:22.020
So the next one is YDA and it's a
verb with the root meaning is to

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.919
the extended hand to throw out the
hand, therefore to worship with the

00:30:25.925 --> 00:30:27.810
extended hand or to lift the hand.

00:30:28.739 --> 00:30:33.030
So here's where we start getting
uncomfortable because it's the

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:36.239
moment where I'm just so you guys
know I'm from the Baptist faith.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.120
This is, this is sometimes allowed.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.020
But when we start going here, it may
get a little bit uncomfortable in the

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:50.340
church, but, but the word praise, in some
instances in the word of God talks about

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:57.690
praise and, and, and I look at this and
I go, this is honorable to God, right?

00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:58.710
It's uncomfortable.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:03.720
But I wanna challenge you with this when
our comfort is more important than his.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:09.870
Um, command to worship when our comfort
is more important than his command to

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:15.570
worship than we probably are worshiping
the wrong thing, which is our comfort.

00:31:15.575 --> 00:31:19.470
It's just so you know, the steps
on my toes because it took me

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:20.850
so long and Bri knows this.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:24.000
It took me so long to get
comfortable to probably even just

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.110
take my hands outta my pocket.

00:31:25.755 --> 00:31:26.055
right.

00:31:26.055 --> 00:31:27.435
And maybe start bouncing the niece.

00:31:27.495 --> 00:31:27.855
Right.

00:31:28.005 --> 00:31:31.365
And I just, so you know, I mean, you
guys probably watched that little

00:31:31.665 --> 00:31:34.365
spoof of the guy, the comedian
talking about the hands worship.

00:31:34.365 --> 00:31:34.905
It's hilarious.

00:31:34.905 --> 00:31:35.445
It's great.

00:31:35.445 --> 00:31:36.045
You should watch it.

00:31:36.045 --> 00:31:38.865
I probably should have put up here
today, but my, the point behind this

00:31:38.865 --> 00:31:40.635
is when we're talking about worship.

00:31:41.355 --> 00:31:44.355
This is one way that God has called
us in the word of God to worship.

00:31:44.355 --> 00:31:46.275
So who wants to read second Chronicles?

00:31:46.275 --> 00:31:46.935
2021.

00:31:46.935 --> 00:31:52.285
That's on here, the first scripture on
the page for this one who wants to read.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:55.410
Anybody.

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.800
Oh, let's go back here to Dave
and I'll come back to you.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:31:59.640
Yep.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:04.080
Amen.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:04.740
Right.

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:06.840
So we look at this give
thanks to the Lord.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.690
And then when he's saying this,
he's saying give thanks to the Lord.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:12.930
Brez loving kindness is everlasting.

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.140
Do you guys know what this sign is?

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.100
And this is not a good sign.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.420
When the police officer says,
put your hands up, surrender.

00:32:23.175 --> 00:32:23.504
Right.

00:32:23.595 --> 00:32:25.334
It's it's, here's what it is.

00:32:25.845 --> 00:32:27.105
It's a sign of weakness.

00:32:27.435 --> 00:32:28.215
You're open.

00:32:29.205 --> 00:32:30.074
You're vulnerable.

00:32:30.705 --> 00:32:33.165
You wanna know why we probably
struggle to lift our hands in worship

00:32:33.645 --> 00:32:38.925
because we're vulnerable, but praise,
praise leads us to vulnerability.

00:32:39.524 --> 00:32:41.415
It leads us open to God.

00:32:41.504 --> 00:32:46.185
It, it, it it's, it's a form of
surrender and yet it's uncomfortable.

00:32:46.185 --> 00:32:49.935
I know this just so you know, this
isn't a Sunday morning thing either.

00:32:50.145 --> 00:32:51.044
This is a life.

00:32:52.065 --> 00:32:55.635
So every morning, uh, think about this.

00:32:55.635 --> 00:33:01.515
Maybe you need to yada in the morning
and just surrender to the Lord, right?

00:33:02.025 --> 00:33:04.725
Maybe it's at work when it is difficult.

00:33:05.505 --> 00:33:11.025
And you need to remind yourself that his
loving kindness is everlasting, right.

00:33:11.745 --> 00:33:12.555
Is what we need.

00:33:12.555 --> 00:33:15.405
And God is called us in
the, in the word to do this.

00:33:15.825 --> 00:33:16.935
So let's look at the next one.

00:33:17.385 --> 00:33:21.554
So, you know, This is one
that, that, that I need more.

00:33:21.885 --> 00:33:23.155
I need more it's TAA.

00:33:23.745 --> 00:33:28.274
It comes from the same principle,
root root word of yadda it,

00:33:28.304 --> 00:33:29.895
but is used more specifically.

00:33:30.105 --> 00:33:35.385
TAA literally means an extension of the
hand in adoration of vow or acceptance.

00:33:35.715 --> 00:33:37.875
And I love this by way of application.

00:33:38.205 --> 00:33:42.495
It is apparent in the Psalms and
elsewhere that it is used for thanking

00:33:42.495 --> 00:33:45.465
God for things not yet received.

00:33:46.395 --> 00:33:49.035
As things, yah, not yet received.

00:33:49.275 --> 00:33:50.685
Let me just give you a great example here.

00:33:50.835 --> 00:33:57.495
It's praising in faith, heard the
story where this guy was going through

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.155
all these strategies and all these
difficulties, but it seemed like he

00:34:01.155 --> 00:34:04.305
just was always praising the Lord.

00:34:04.305 --> 00:34:08.805
And somebody asked him this question,
how do you praise the Lord in the

00:34:08.805 --> 00:34:10.305
midst of these dire situations?

00:34:11.025 --> 00:34:12.345
How do you not worry?

00:34:12.495 --> 00:34:13.875
And this is what the, the guy says.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.805
He says, I don't worry.

00:34:14.835 --> 00:34:14.985
I.

00:34:16.319 --> 00:34:17.219
I don't worry.

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:18.330
I worship.

00:34:19.379 --> 00:34:24.270
So this is a challenge to move our worry
of whether we have enough money or whether

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:28.770
we're, what is the doctor gonna say, or
will we ever get over this hump of this,

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:32.940
or will our kids ever, ever learn this,
or will we ever have a good marriage

00:34:32.944 --> 00:34:34.980
or will our kids ever listen to us?

00:34:35.129 --> 00:34:44.879
Whatever you worry about, our worry
should transition into da to worship.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.020
To worship and faith that God
will change your circumstances.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.860
To know that God hears your praise.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:35:00.300
Your praise to God is an offering
to him and he hears you and he

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.040
desires to move on your behalf.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.920
And it's a prayer and praise of faith.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:11.460
He goes, I need this, I need this
because it is hard sometimes to praise

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.680
in the midst of uncertainty and.

00:35:14.865 --> 00:35:17.325
So somebody read Psalm 50 14.

00:35:17.325 --> 00:35:18.705
Let's let's just let Lauren do this.

00:35:18.944 --> 00:35:20.265
Cuz you raised your hand in a minute.

00:35:20.265 --> 00:35:21.555
Psalm 50 14.

00:35:21.555 --> 00:35:22.335
Is that first one?

00:35:27.315 --> 00:35:27.645
Amen.

00:35:28.455 --> 00:35:33.044
So we see that God desires
for us to praise and faith.

00:35:33.225 --> 00:35:37.634
So let's continue on the next one
on the backside is Shaak which means

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:42.524
to shout, to address and allow tone
and to command a trumpet or tri.

00:35:43.215 --> 00:35:45.795
Let me mention two examples.

00:35:46.155 --> 00:35:47.295
So I think this'll make sense.

00:35:47.295 --> 00:35:49.395
Number one, it's a spiritual example.

00:35:49.395 --> 00:35:50.115
I'll go first.

00:35:50.595 --> 00:35:52.425
I don't know if you've
ever, and it's occasional.

00:35:52.455 --> 00:35:56.075
I dunno if you've ever heard my wife in
the middle of worship, just go, whoa.

00:35:58.095 --> 00:35:59.685
And you're probably
wondering what just happened.

00:36:01.185 --> 00:36:04.035
That is an expression of Shabbat.

00:36:05.255 --> 00:36:08.805
It is a loud shout to praise the Lord.

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:13.020
To address the Lord and
to, to give him praise.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:19.050
And again, guys, this is uncomfortable
because shouldn't, we be reserved

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:24.210
and humble and we'll get to that one
at times, the word of God, and I'm

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:25.980
gonna read this one in Psalm 47 1.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.570
He says, oh, clap your hands.

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:31.020
All you people shout to
God with the voice of joy.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:35.640
Sometimes that's what we need
to do is to praise God in that.

00:36:36.689 --> 00:36:41.220
See, here's one where you're gonna
relate if you're a Bengals fan and

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.649
when Dallas is getting hammered
later, you know what you're gonna do?

00:36:44.779 --> 00:36:45.200
Woo.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.040
Go Bengals.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.279
And that's not gonna be
uncomfortable, is it?

00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:54.330
But it's uncomfortable to pray.

00:36:54.334 --> 00:36:57.390
I'm just so you know, I'm
stepping on my own toes.

00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:58.480
This isn't just you.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:59.399
Okay.

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.220
It's some challenging me
that God is teaching us.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:03.990
What worship truly is.

00:37:05.265 --> 00:37:06.135
Let's look at the next one.

00:37:06.945 --> 00:37:10.395
Barack, which means to kneel
down to bless God as an act of

00:37:10.395 --> 00:37:13.515
adoration or to salute, right?

00:37:13.515 --> 00:37:15.855
This is that moment of humility.

00:37:16.185 --> 00:37:19.335
This is that moment that we saw
Amanda up here where she just felt

00:37:19.335 --> 00:37:21.135
so led by God to get a hundred earns.

00:37:21.645 --> 00:37:25.815
And to just say, I surrender,
Lord, I praise you for who you are.

00:37:26.415 --> 00:37:28.725
This is a difficult position.

00:37:28.725 --> 00:37:30.015
Number one, my knees are hurting.

00:37:31.515 --> 00:37:33.735
Number two, if you're old
enough, you might not get back.

00:37:35.385 --> 00:37:40.875
But it is a position that is
honoring to the Lord guys.

00:37:41.175 --> 00:37:46.545
It, it is a show that you need
God to move that he is good,

00:37:47.325 --> 00:37:50.475
that he is worthy to be humble.

00:37:51.975 --> 00:37:55.905
And to go before the Lord, see, this
is another area and I want somebody

00:37:55.905 --> 00:37:58.095
to read this verse nine, Psalm 95.

00:37:58.095 --> 00:38:02.055
Actually, I want you to read Psalm 34
1, which is the last one on this one,

00:38:02.055 --> 00:38:03.645
Psalm 34, 1 who wants to read that?

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.310
Chaning go ahead, buddy.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:16.770
I love that his praise shall
continually be in my mouth.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:21.900
I heard somebody give this example on this
one that even though we are bowed down,

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:27.180
we're kneeling down to the Lord that this
is a praise that our eyes never leave.

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:32.759
The Lord that we follow him
wherever he goes, that we do not.

00:38:33.135 --> 00:38:38.535
Let our lives ever stop seeing
the Lord and to praise him.

00:38:39.195 --> 00:38:39.495
Right.

00:38:40.425 --> 00:38:43.005
The next one is Zar and we kind
of already talked about this one.

00:38:43.665 --> 00:38:45.525
Zar means to pluck the
strings of an instrument.

00:38:45.525 --> 00:38:45.945
Right?

00:38:46.125 --> 00:38:47.115
Good job, Matt and Doug.

00:38:47.115 --> 00:38:47.625
You're doing it.

00:38:47.805 --> 00:38:48.285
Woohoo.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:51.360
Right or to sing and to praise.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.490
So good job, everybody that's
singing and praising, right.

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:56.580
Musical words, which is largely
involved with joyful expressions

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.620
of music with musical instruments.

00:38:58.625 --> 00:38:58.890
Right?

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:01.380
So weekly worship, this makes total sense.

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.200
Does somebody run a
read Psalm 2113 for me?

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:15.180
Amen, man.

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.040
This last one's a fun one.

00:39:18.884 --> 00:39:21.765
Tola Tola and this is not tequila.

00:39:22.095 --> 00:39:24.404
So don't go home and
praise God with tequila.

00:39:25.214 --> 00:39:29.444
It's Tola make sure we
got that right though.

00:39:29.444 --> 00:39:31.575
What you send me pictures later
saying I'm praises in God.

00:39:35.924 --> 00:39:37.125
I'll pay for that one later.

00:39:39.694 --> 00:39:43.154
So this is actually a really good one.

00:39:43.154 --> 00:39:43.935
Let's get serious here.

00:39:43.935 --> 00:39:44.564
This is really good.

00:39:44.564 --> 00:39:44.685
One.

00:39:44.685 --> 00:39:45.404
This is another one of my.

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:46.350
Okay.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:47.370
That's another one of my favorites.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:52.080
It's derived from the word Halah and
means to sing the singing of Haahs

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:57.000
or to sing or to law perceived to
involve music, especially singing

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.550
hymns of the spirit or praise.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.340
And as it begin to study a little
bit more about this, this is

00:40:02.345 --> 00:40:03.690
just really a great example.

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:08.670
This is really spontaneous singing, any
better ever, just walking around and

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.170
all of a sudden, you just start singing.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.990
And sometimes it's to some of
the worship songs that you know,

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.950
but sometimes it's your own.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:18.330
See this to Lela is
sometimes a personal song.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:22.470
It's a moment when you start repeating
words, that means something so much

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.180
deepens down inside your heart.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.330
It's a new song for you guys.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:32.340
There is days where I sing a new song and
it's a song of praise to the Lord that is

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.980
an offering to him that, that he hears.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.440
And I need him to hear.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:37.980
Right.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:42.240
And so he says this in Psalm
22 3, yet that art, holy.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.590
O th who art and thrown
upon the praise of Israel.

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:53.160
And so I gave you these, this handout
one to say, thank you to the person that

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.130
did do this, because this was powerful
as begin to study more about this.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:01.230
But two, this is a great thing to
hang up on your, your, your, I don't

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:03.990
know if you still do this, hang it
up on your fridge, put it in your

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:09.730
prayer journal and think what is, what
is one area that I can praise God.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:15.060
In today that I can, I can
praise him in a different way.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.610
I can worship him in a different way.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:20.580
And we see these as examples to follow.

00:41:20.585 --> 00:41:22.410
So I hope this was helpful for you.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.390
It encouraged me for sure.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:30.060
So as we see these seven different ways to
praise God, these are all different ways

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.080
to show, show our appreciation, our love,
our trust, our faith, our belief in God.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.790
He is our sustainer, our provider, and
our savior, and he is worthy to be praise.

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:44.610
Let's not miss the last part of
this Psalm who should be praised.

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.380
So we said, where should he be praised?

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.220
Why should he be praised
basically how he should be

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.069
praised and who should praise him?

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.950
It says, let everything that breathe.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:56.970
Praise the Lord.

00:41:56.975 --> 00:41:59.279
Everybody do something with
me, everybody ready on three.

00:41:59.279 --> 00:42:00.150
You're gonna take a deep breath.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:01.620
1, 2, 3.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.170
Great.

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:06.000
We all fit this standard.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.009
Check mark.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.240
You can't get outta this one.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:09.810
Okay.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.380
Let everything that
breathes praise the Lord.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:17.520
Let me ask this question to you.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.120
Why should everyone that
breathes praise the Lord?

00:42:26.609 --> 00:42:28.230
Because we have breath in our it's simple.

00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:30.660
It's it's that simple.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:32.799
And, and guys, so you understand.

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.490
You may be going through or have
gone through some of the most

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:40.109
difficult circumstances in your life.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:44.310
And I can't even imagine what you're
dealing with, but if you just took a

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:47.009
deep breath, God is worthy to be praised.

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:49.950
Like in the simplest thing.

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:51.810
Maybe you've gotta narrow
it down to that today.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.390
And some days that's all I
need to narrow down to Lord.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.509
Everything seems to be falling down
around me, but that breath that I

00:42:57.515 --> 00:42:59.640
just breathe is enough to praise you.

00:43:00.419 --> 00:43:02.490
Everything that has breath should praise.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:08.069
So why do we struggle to praise God?

00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:11.850
It's usually, and, and again, when I
say, why do we struggle to praise God

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:13.080
in these ways that we just mentioned?

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.310
It's usually because we say
this one, I'm not a singer.

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.890
My voice is bad and I will am with you.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.210
I am not a good singer.

00:43:21.214 --> 00:43:21.509
Right?

00:43:22.049 --> 00:43:23.130
I'm uncomfortable.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.950
It's, it's uncomfortable to praise
God in some of these ways because

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.630
it, it, it makes me vulnerable.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.330
Or what if somebody looks at
me and what if I look weird?

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:31.230
What if I sound weird?

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.000
I get it.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.780
We struggle to praise the Lord
sometimes because we take it for

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:40.980
granted that we get to praise the
one who gave us everything we have.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:41.280
Right.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:44.160
So I look at this and I say, I get it.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:46.050
I totally understand it.

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:52.410
My challenge for you is to lean into
it a little bit more and, and, and

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:55.590
to begin to find ways to worship
the Lord differently this week.

00:43:56.325 --> 00:44:00.165
Look at this list and say, how can I,
even if it's in the own private room

00:44:00.345 --> 00:44:06.105
on your drive, that you start shouting
out to the Lord, or maybe it's in your

00:44:06.105 --> 00:44:11.385
closet where you get out on your knees,
or maybe it's next week on Sunday, when

00:44:11.385 --> 00:44:16.755
we have a worship Sunday where you join
and worship for the first time and you

00:44:16.755 --> 00:44:21.165
belt out as loud as you can with, with
song, whatever it is, I just encourage

00:44:21.165 --> 00:44:23.205
you to take a next step and experience.

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:27.090
What the Lord has given us as,
as an opportunity, as an example,

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:30.330
as a command to praise him,
even though it's uncomfortable.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.670
I wanna end before I kind of walk through
a conclusion here of, of the message.

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:37.290
I wanna walk through Psalm 96.

00:44:37.295 --> 00:44:39.720
This Psalm came to my heart and I
really wanted to walk through this.

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.690
And so I'm asking for one
person to read the whole Psalm.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:48.150
So is there somebody would love to
read Psalm 96 all the way through.

00:44:52.125 --> 00:44:55.065
Anybody Psalm 96 all the way through.

00:44:55.485 --> 00:44:56.475
Ryan's gonna read.

00:44:56.835 --> 00:44:57.345
Okay, here we go.

00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:58.035
Psalm 96.

00:45:11.555 --> 00:45:11.904
No.

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:35.005
Okay.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:14.965
thank you.

00:46:16.165 --> 00:46:21.025
Since we think about worship and we
think about a couple of different things.

00:46:21.025 --> 00:46:21.675
I want you to think about.

00:46:22.935 --> 00:46:26.355
God was never created for us.

00:46:26.685 --> 00:46:28.455
We were created for God.

00:46:29.325 --> 00:46:32.595
So when we come to worship God
every day, whether it's worship

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:37.005
service, whether it's in our own
time in the cars, our preference

00:46:37.009 --> 00:46:40.785
or our desires to be comfortable
is not the most important thing.

00:46:41.045 --> 00:46:41.715
Worship.

00:46:42.435 --> 00:46:43.485
I've heard this statement before.

00:46:43.755 --> 00:46:47.955
Worship is about giving
your breath back to God.

00:46:49.725 --> 00:46:51.225
So when you sing it.

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:52.890
Offering to him.

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:57.450
And he doesn't say sing only if you have a
good voice and you can be in the key of B.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:58.380
I don't even know if that's the thing.

00:46:59.279 --> 00:46:59.580
Okay.

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:04.050
If you, I dunno if it's not sorry,
but anyways, that's how much, I

00:47:04.055 --> 00:47:05.190
don't know, worship and I still sing.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:05.580
Okay.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.630
That's just a great example.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.020
So when worship's about giving
your breath back to God, right?

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:14.040
Giving our praise, our life, our
gratitude to God and all he has done for.

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:16.980
We have all been given the resources.

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:17.759
This is my challenge.

00:47:17.759 --> 00:47:18.150
Every week.

00:47:18.359 --> 00:47:21.960
We, I, I give you the resources to
go out and apply this to your life.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.270
This, this paper that talks
about the seven different ways

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:25.380
that we can praise and worship.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.839
God, which ones have you neglected?

00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:31.140
I, I can see a couple on
there where I'm good at.

00:47:31.259 --> 00:47:34.589
Like, I love praise in the Lord in these
areas, but there's some that's vulnerable.

00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:36.420
There's some that I've just been avoiding.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.980
There's some that I
didn't even know about.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:40.200
And I'm hoping that you learn
something today that you can begin

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:43.710
to apply these to your life and be
a part of the corporate worship as.

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.930
So take them, practice them,
talk about them, live them out.

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:52.500
And as you do, I'll just tell you this,
as you do, not only are we honoring the

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.080
Lord, but there is something special.

00:47:55.259 --> 00:47:59.610
There's something special about
worshiping the Lord and how

00:47:59.615 --> 00:48:01.259
that brings you closer to God.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.690
And if you're wondering this,
just, just wanna challenge you

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:07.740
this, Y you ever struggle with just
wanting to get in the word of God?

00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.580
I know I do.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.410
Even as a pastor, I still
wanna open the word of God.

00:48:10.415 --> 00:48:13.770
I'm like, eh, when I spend
time praising the Lord.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:15.779
Like I'll turn on music.

00:48:15.779 --> 00:48:17.610
And I start praising Lord and genuine.

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:19.350
I'm listening to the words
and I'm praising him.

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:23.340
I wanna know him more and it just makes
me wanna get into the word and it,

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:24.720
and it makes me wanna know him more.

00:48:24.725 --> 00:48:26.910
And it makes me wanna tell
other people about him when

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:28.799
I spend time Pring the Lord.

00:48:29.549 --> 00:48:30.720
So maybe that's what you need.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.160
Maybe that's what we all need.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:34.740
It's just to start with
praise in the mornings.

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:38.610
And maybe that will draw you into more
of the Lord and more of what God's called

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:40.500
you to, and more to experience of him.

00:48:41.549 --> 00:48:43.049
But my challenge always is every.

00:48:43.755 --> 00:48:46.845
If you're sitting here and you're
hearing worship about the Lord and

00:48:46.995 --> 00:48:49.485
how do I worship him, but you've
never given your life to him.

00:48:50.265 --> 00:48:53.205
Maybe you've never just taken that
step of faith to say, I trust you.

00:48:53.505 --> 00:48:55.815
And I believe that you are
worthy to be worshiped.

00:48:56.115 --> 00:48:57.075
Today is that day.

00:48:57.705 --> 00:48:58.545
Today is that day.

00:48:58.695 --> 00:49:01.455
And I think too many times
we put it off till tomorrow.

00:49:01.755 --> 00:49:06.855
Next week, when today is the day that
God has given you to experience his

00:49:06.855 --> 00:49:10.455
hope and his salvation and his love.

00:49:11.535 --> 00:49:14.655
In a day that you can begin to worship
him truly with your heart and your life.

00:49:14.895 --> 00:49:16.785
And if that's you today,
I want to talk with you.

00:49:16.965 --> 00:49:18.075
That's why I stand in the back.

00:49:18.075 --> 00:49:20.535
That's why I stay at service over
there to the next steps table.

00:49:20.535 --> 00:49:21.075
I wanna.

00:49:21.975 --> 00:49:24.315
Conversations about what
it means to follow Jesus.

00:49:24.525 --> 00:49:27.555
I wanna have conversations with you
about applying these things today.

00:49:27.555 --> 00:49:30.585
If you're struggling with worship and
how to, if you've given your life to

00:49:30.585 --> 00:49:33.375
Christ and just struggling with being
engaged with the Lord and, and being

00:49:33.375 --> 00:49:36.674
able to follow him, maybe you need to
just come talk and I don't have anything

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.975
special other than just a friend to
listen to and talk about what we can

00:49:39.975 --> 00:49:41.685
do together to help pursue the Lord.

00:49:42.015 --> 00:49:43.484
I challenge you to take that next step.

00:49:44.535 --> 00:49:46.305
I challenge you the next day,
the next step, but during.

00:49:46.799 --> 00:49:51.240
Invitation when we take time to pray and
ask Lord this question, what parts of

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.040
worship do we need to apply to our lives?

00:49:53.549 --> 00:49:55.439
What areas do I need
to take next steps in?

00:49:55.439 --> 00:49:59.850
Maybe it's a step of faith during
this time of invitation do that.

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:06.149
But then as we stand up to worship,
worship differently, worship differently.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:11.040
Then when you sat down at the end
of worship, that may look something

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:15.839
different for each person, but don't
hold back because Jesus is worth.

00:50:16.425 --> 00:50:16.905
To worship.

00:50:17.535 --> 00:50:18.705
So I'm gonna pray for us.

00:50:19.695 --> 00:50:22.215
And then we will have
a time of invitation.

00:50:22.215 --> 00:50:22.875
Lord Jesus.

00:50:22.875 --> 00:50:23.805
We love you, Lord.

00:50:24.615 --> 00:50:31.605
We're so thankful Lord for you because
we know that you love us so much.

00:50:32.655 --> 00:50:36.975
Lord, as we reflect on this
Psalm, we reflect on how you've

00:50:36.975 --> 00:50:39.075
invited us to praise the Lord.

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:44.340
Lord we've reminded, been reminded
Lord that your word does not

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:47.690
return void, and we know that we
can praise you on earth and in.

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:54.029
We know that we can praise you
Lord, because of your greatness

00:50:54.359 --> 00:50:57.690
because of your power, because of
all the things you've done for us.

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:00.240
Lord, we have so much to
praise you about Lord.

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:04.200
And I just want to remind ourselves Lord
today that if you did not do anything

00:51:04.205 --> 00:51:07.859
else, Lord, that we have enough to
praise you for the rest of our lives.

00:51:08.279 --> 00:51:13.370
So Lord, we are praising you today, but
Lord, thank you for giving us the wisdom.

00:51:14.445 --> 00:51:18.195
Today through your word and through
just studying about what worship is and,

00:51:18.315 --> 00:51:22.035
and praise Lord that we learned so many
different ways that we can praise you.

00:51:22.035 --> 00:51:26.715
Lord God, don't let us leave here
today and continue on praising the

00:51:26.715 --> 00:51:28.005
same way we've been praising you.

00:51:28.305 --> 00:51:31.485
Lord, let us take something that we
learned today and begin to apply that

00:51:31.485 --> 00:51:35.415
to our lives Lord, so that we can grow
closer to you so that we can honor

00:51:35.415 --> 00:51:38.775
you more with our lives and Lord,
so that we can be encouraged in our.

00:51:39.975 --> 00:51:43.095
As we go and pursue relationships
with other people to help

00:51:43.095 --> 00:51:44.265
them come to faith in you.

00:51:44.655 --> 00:51:47.325
And to be able to praise you
Lord, for the first time, there

00:51:47.325 --> 00:51:48.735
is no person in this room.

00:51:48.735 --> 00:51:50.025
There's no person in our city.

00:51:50.175 --> 00:51:54.015
There's no person in each one of our
lives, Lord, that should not praise you.

00:51:54.045 --> 00:51:58.425
Everyone has been called to praise
you and to come to know you.

00:51:59.865 --> 00:52:03.465
So as we end today in prayer, as we
end today in worship, Lord hallelu.

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:07.529
Praise God may we honor you
with our worship and our praise.

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:09.120
We pray this in your heavenly name.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:09.779
Amen.
