00:01:37.244 --> 00:01:40.125
All right, if you're in the back,
go ahead and find you a seat.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:43.695
Um, I think time got away from us.

00:01:43.695 --> 00:01:46.544
I looked up and I was like, Hey, I got
30 seconds and the next thing you know,

00:01:46.544 --> 00:01:47.925
I look up and I've got four and a half.

00:01:48.794 --> 00:01:49.574
Good job tech team.

00:01:49.574 --> 00:01:51.014
You just reset the five minute timer.

00:01:51.884 --> 00:01:54.195
. You thought I wouldn't catch
it if you did that long enough?

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:59.505
We would just pray and
leave . I'm sorry, I caught it.

00:01:59.955 --> 00:02:04.335
Um, one of the things I do love about
our church is the community aspect of it.

00:02:04.815 --> 00:02:07.455
So seeing that our tech team
recognize, Hey, everybody's

00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:08.745
talking, let's do this another five.

00:02:09.764 --> 00:02:10.304
Cool.

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:11.834
Like that's what we wanna be.

00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:16.785
We wanna be a church that loves hanging
out, loves connecting, and obviously

00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:18.135
we got to do that this morning.

00:02:18.135 --> 00:02:21.494
So what you're telling me then, I've
gotta cut my preaching down five minutes.

00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:23.505
Don't hold me to that.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.115
. Um, so we are continuing
our series, uh, this week.

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:33.195
This is our third week of, he
Shall Be called, speaking about the

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:35.745
names of Jesus, the Coming Messiah.

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:39.615
Um, and so this week we're gonna
talk about Everlasting Father and the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.495
translation that I'm reading today in
csb, it's gonna be The Eternal Father.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:45.105
So we'll dive into that
a little bit deeper.

00:02:45.405 --> 00:02:47.145
Um, but I wanna start off
by asking this question.

00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:49.815
Anybody remember the energizer.

00:02:50.595 --> 00:02:51.375
Energizer Bunny.

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:51.705
Yeah.

00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:55.425
What was like the, the
statement of that commercial?

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:59.325
Anybody keeps going and going and going.

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:01.065
Here's the thing.

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.135
It's not true.

00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:08.475
Uh, so the reason why I'm calling
that out is because there is nothing

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.295
that just keeps going on and on
and on forever except for God.

00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:14.265
Uh, and I know this about the
Energizer Bunny and the batter.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.030
The, the Energizer batteries is
because I used to play anybody play

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.269
the the we back, you know, in the
day maybe you're still playing that.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.239
Um, back whenever Guitar
Hero was the thing.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.369
Um, you know, I, I played a little bit of
it and it kept running outta batteries.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.325
I kept having to throw
'em away and get new ones.

00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:33.525
So it did run out.

00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:36.885
It maybe was because I was playing
it too long, but what I would say

00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:38.475
is that is not a true statement.

00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:44.445
And as we'll look at today that everything
that we think is going to last forever

00:03:44.595 --> 00:03:49.735
and going to give us complete fulfillment
in this life will always fall short.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.540
But Jesus doesn't fall short,
and he is the everlasting father.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.380
And so I want to talk today and just
kind of catch you up on where we were,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.140
and that's what I've been doing every
week, is to make sure that we, if

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.510
you're new here, if you haven't been
here for every part of the series,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.890
you kind of understand where we were.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.489
But as we've continued this series,
the last two weeks, we've talked about.

00:04:08.755 --> 00:04:13.015
Two other names of the coming Messiah,
and this is out of Isaiah chapter nine.

00:04:13.015 --> 00:04:15.804
If you wanna pull that up on
your Bible or on your app, you

00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:16.615
can, we'll have it up here.

00:04:16.615 --> 00:04:17.575
This is out of a Isaiah.

00:04:17.575 --> 00:04:19.375
Chapter nine will be in
verses six and seven.

00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:23.245
But the, the, the first two names that
we talked about was, the first one was

00:04:23.245 --> 00:04:27.594
Wonderful counselor, and so this is
the statement that we took out of this.

00:04:27.594 --> 00:04:32.515
The wonderful counselor, the coming
Messiah, Jesus is above anything in the

00:04:32.515 --> 00:04:36.985
world that we can comprehend when it
comes to guiding and directing our lives.

00:04:37.605 --> 00:04:40.605
The next name that we learned about Jesus.

00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:43.005
This coming Messiah was mighty God.

00:04:43.365 --> 00:04:44.445
One of the coolest parts.

00:04:44.445 --> 00:04:47.535
If you weren't here last week,
we really got to talk about how

00:04:47.535 --> 00:04:49.935
mighty God has been in our lives.

00:04:50.265 --> 00:04:53.955
Um, and, and just really even if we begin
to look into the Bible, we see how mighty

00:04:53.955 --> 00:04:56.115
God was in the lives of so many people.

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.035
And it's easy to forget that.

00:04:58.035 --> 00:04:59.535
And so here's what we took from that.

00:04:59.535 --> 00:05:02.405
Jesus is stronger and more powerful.

00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:05.635
Anything else that has
ever been created or made.

00:05:06.025 --> 00:05:10.255
Jesus is above all and is all
knowing and control of everything.

00:05:11.275 --> 00:05:12.655
Here's what I started
thinking through guys.

00:05:12.655 --> 00:05:20.125
If we stopped with those two names and
we recognize Jesus as those two things

00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:22.345
in our lives, it would change our lives.

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:25.915
If we stopped with those two things and
didn't change anything else, we didn't

00:05:25.915 --> 00:05:29.395
learn anything else about God that
would be enough to change our lives.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.605
Do you.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:31.815
Here's the cool part.

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:35.534
There's more like, I love whenever
there's more yet you ever get to the,

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:38.115
like, the end of like eating your
candy and you think it's all gone and

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.275
you, you shake the box and there's
a couple more m and ms in there.

00:05:40.275 --> 00:05:42.885
I like painting m and m's
and it's like, I get excited.

00:05:43.245 --> 00:05:47.594
That's very minimal to how excited I
get about how when I learn more about

00:05:47.594 --> 00:05:53.505
Jesus and I realize how much more there
is to God that, that we get to see.

00:05:53.505 --> 00:05:56.085
And I, I hope that you see this today.

00:05:57.615 --> 00:06:02.355
When we think about our relationships with
Jesus, I, I, I, I have this, this feeling

00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:07.785
at times where even myself is very much
like sometimes our Bibles on the shelf.

00:06:07.785 --> 00:06:09.945
Anybody ever have a Bible
on the shelf as decoration?

00:06:10.005 --> 00:06:13.155
I mean, don't, don't, it's a
decoration because we've had so

00:06:13.155 --> 00:06:15.015
many of them and they collect dust.

00:06:15.345 --> 00:06:16.485
Why are they collecting dust?

00:06:16.485 --> 00:06:18.765
It's because we, we don't
get into them anymore.

00:06:18.765 --> 00:06:21.315
We don't learn more about
God, and, and I started think.

00:06:22.005 --> 00:06:25.005
Our relationships with Christ and
this season of Christmas, and it's

00:06:25.005 --> 00:06:29.805
so easy to prioritize everything else
but Jesus during Christmas season.

00:06:29.805 --> 00:06:30.285
Why?

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:35.505
Because there's so much to do, so many
family dinners, so many, uh, presents

00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:40.725
to buy so many places to travel, so
many decorations to put up, you name it.

00:06:40.725 --> 00:06:43.365
And so we get so distracted
that Jesus become.

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:46.260
On the back burner of this season.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.630
And then if it's not this season,
it's every season of our life

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.010
because of work and because of kids'
activities and because of you name it.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.080
And so I, I think today as we dive back
into this and we learn about another

00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:04.590
name of Jesus, I pray that all of us
lean in and whatever we learned today,

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:10.020
we take with us this week every day, and
we remind us how God relates with us.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.475
So again, unlike the energizer,
Who doesn't last forever?

00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:16.095
Or the Energizer batteries, right?

00:07:16.155 --> 00:07:19.425
Jesus is our everlasting
father or our eternal father.

00:07:20.175 --> 00:07:23.925
And so whenever we jump into this text,
we're gonna kind of mill it out a little

00:07:23.925 --> 00:07:27.975
bit in the context, and then we will kind
of jump right into the Everlasting Father.

00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:29.055
So let's read here again.

00:07:29.055 --> 00:07:30.345
Isaiah chapter nine.

00:07:30.795 --> 00:07:32.865
Uh, starting in verse
six, here's what it says.

00:07:32.865 --> 00:07:35.105
This is for a child will be.

00:07:35.685 --> 00:07:43.155
For us, a son will be given to us and the
government will be on his shoulders and he

00:07:43.155 --> 00:07:49.875
will be named Wonderful counselor, mighty
God, eternal father and prince of peace.

00:07:50.385 --> 00:07:54.284
The dominion will be vast in
its prosperity, will never end.

00:07:54.914 --> 00:08:00.284
He will rain on the throne of David over
his kingdom to establish and to sustain

00:08:00.284 --> 00:08:02.565
it with justice and righteousness.

00:08:02.745 --> 00:08:04.775
From now on and forever.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.370
The Z of the Lord of Armies
will accomplish this.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.210
Let's pray.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.780
Lord Jesus, we thank you so much again
for the opportunity to come together.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.740
Open up your Word.

00:08:14.475 --> 00:08:17.595
And begin to dive in to learn
more and more about you.

00:08:18.105 --> 00:08:21.825
God, I am praying that today every
one of us has came with a heart open

00:08:21.825 --> 00:08:27.615
and a mind open Lord, to learn and
to know you more and to be changed.

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:31.935
And Lord, as we leave outta here today,
as we go out changed, Lord, I pray

00:08:31.935 --> 00:08:35.895
that we begin to live in that constant
relationship with you, Lord, where we

00:08:35.895 --> 00:08:39.105
learn more about you, we apply it to
our lives, and we share it with others

00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:41.025
so that their lives can be transformed.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:48.540
God, help us continue to prioritize you
in this season and not forget what you've

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.350
done for us and how you've saved us, and
how you've forgiven us, and how you've

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:57.330
called us to experience an amazing life,
this side of heaven, and on the other.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.060
And so, Lord, we just prayed
this in your heavenly name.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.050
Amen.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.560
So I want to jump in today
just kind of setting up here.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.230
The book of Isaiah again is a prophet.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.910
A prophet talks about.

00:09:09.345 --> 00:09:09.915
The future.

00:09:10.185 --> 00:09:10.605
Right.

00:09:10.845 --> 00:09:13.574
And sometimes this can be
in the short future, right?

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.235
As he's talking specifically here, uh,
to the people of Israel, the people

00:09:17.235 --> 00:09:20.715
of Judas specifically, but then he's
also talking futuristic into even

00:09:20.715 --> 00:09:24.975
our time in this idea of the coming
Messiah and where I wanna jump in.

00:09:24.975 --> 00:09:28.615
I've kind of jumped in at different
places each time about the history of.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.970
Where this text is written from, and I'm
gonna jump in the history of Joshua, and

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.140
just to kinda catch you up with this.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.350
So Joshua came right after Moses, right?

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.850
Moses led the people out of Egypt
to go experience the Promised

00:09:40.855 --> 00:09:44.130
Land, but Moses was not able to
lead them into the Promised Land.

00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:46.415
And so he wasn't able to do that.

00:09:46.415 --> 00:09:49.444
So Joshua did that, and Joshua
led them into the promised Land.

00:09:49.444 --> 00:09:51.605
And he was a valiant warrior, right?

00:09:51.605 --> 00:09:54.935
He went in and he helped defeat
a lot of the people and he

00:09:54.939 --> 00:09:56.074
got to the end of his life.

00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:57.125
And there's a couple things he said.

00:09:57.125 --> 00:10:00.485
And so what I want you to do, um, if
you, if you have your Bibles with you,

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.415
I'm gonna turn to Joshua chapter 24,
and I'm gonna read a couple things

00:10:04.415 --> 00:10:08.855
for you to see, um, what they were
talking about at the end of Joshua's.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:15.000
And then we're gonna talk about the
beginning of judges as well and see

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.790
what happened after, um, that as well.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.390
And so, as long as I can find where
Joshua is, I should know that.

00:10:21.395 --> 00:10:22.800
So Joshua chapter 24.

00:10:22.805 --> 00:10:24.660
I'm gonna read verses 14 through 31.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.580
So this is at the end of Joshua's life.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.180
What I'm trying to do is lead us
straight into where Isaiah's talking.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.050
So it came here at the end of Joshua 24.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.170
They defeated a lot of their enemies,
and Joshua was at the end of his life.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.240
And he says this, starting in verse 14.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.390
He says, therefore, the
f uh, fear of the Lord.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.160
So he is gathered all the people
of Israel, and this is what he

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.030
said, fear the Lord and worship
him in sincerity and truth.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.130
Get rid of the gods of your father's.

00:10:49.685 --> 00:10:52.865
Your father's worshiped beyond
the Yares River and in Egypt,

00:10:53.255 --> 00:10:54.995
um, and worship the Lord.

00:10:55.265 --> 00:10:58.025
But if it doesn't please
you to worship the Lord.

00:10:58.295 --> 00:11:01.925
Choose for yourselves today, which
you will worship the gods of your

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.215
father's worshiped beyond the Yares
river on the God or the Gods of

00:11:06.215 --> 00:11:08.465
Amorites and whose land you are living.

00:11:08.885 --> 00:11:11.885
As for me and my house,
we will worship the.

00:11:12.675 --> 00:11:16.215
And then the people replied, we will
certainly not abandon the Lord to

00:11:16.215 --> 00:11:18.315
worship other gods for the Lord.

00:11:18.315 --> 00:11:21.855
Our God brought us and our fathers
out of the land of Egypt and out of

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.395
the place of slavery, and performed
these great signs before our eyes.

00:11:25.694 --> 00:11:30.704
He also protected us all along the way
we went and among the peoples whose lands

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.545
we traveled through, the Lord drove out
before us, all the peoples, including

00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:36.165
the Amorites who lived in the land.

00:11:36.225 --> 00:11:39.885
And we too shall worship the
Lord because he is our God.

00:11:40.395 --> 00:11:43.605
But Joshua told the people, you
will not be able to worship the

00:11:43.605 --> 00:11:45.165
Lord because he is a holy God.

00:11:45.165 --> 00:11:46.215
He is a jealous God.

00:11:46.215 --> 00:11:49.995
He will not forgive your transgressions
and sins if you abandon the.

00:11:50.474 --> 00:11:53.295
And worship foreign gods, he
will turn against you and harm

00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:55.125
you and completely destroy you.

00:11:55.365 --> 00:11:56.084
And after.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.990
And after he has been good to,
you know, the people answer,

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.670
Joshua, we will worship the Lord.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.740
And Joshua then told the people, you
are the witnesses against yourselves.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.230
You yourselves have chosen
to worship the Lord.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.400
We are witnesses.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.730
They said, then get rid of the foreign
gods that are among you and turn your

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.710
hearts to the Lord, the God of Israel.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.250
So the people said to Joshua, we will
worship the Lord our God and obey.

00:12:21.224 --> 00:12:25.094
On that day, Joshua made a covenant
for the people at shek and established

00:12:25.094 --> 00:12:26.805
the statue in accordance for them.

00:12:26.984 --> 00:12:30.344
And Joshua recorded these things in
the book of the law, and he also took

00:12:30.344 --> 00:12:33.765
a large stone and he set it up under
the oak of the sanctuary of the Lord.

00:12:34.005 --> 00:12:36.645
And Joshua said to all the
people, you see this stone?

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:42.330
You, it will be a witness to you
and to us for it is, um, heard all

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.180
the words the Lord has said to us,
and it will be a witness against

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.920
you so that you will not deny God.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.040
And then Joshua sent the people
away each to his own inheritance.

00:12:50.045 --> 00:12:51.870
We're almost done after these things.

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:56.370
The Lord's servant Joshua, son of
none, died at the age of 110 and they

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.410
buried him in the allotted territory.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:03.660
Um, Timothy Sarah in the hill country
of Ephram, north of Mount Gas and

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.170
Israel worshiped the Lord throughout
Joshua's lifetime and during the

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.650
lifetime of the elders who outlived
Joshua, who had experienced all the

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.900
works of the Lord and done to Israel.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.940
So let's just stop right there,
and I know there was a lot,

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.080
but I wanted you to see this.

00:13:16.785 --> 00:13:18.375
Joshua was saying,
choose who you'll serve.

00:13:18.405 --> 00:13:19.365
Oh, we'll, serve the Lord.

00:13:19.635 --> 00:13:21.194
Make sure you choose who you'll serve.

00:13:21.194 --> 00:13:21.344
Yeah.

00:13:21.344 --> 00:13:22.005
We'll serve the Lord.

00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:22.935
Are you sure?

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:23.594
You know what you're, yeah.

00:13:23.865 --> 00:13:24.555
We're gonna serve the Lord.

00:13:24.555 --> 00:13:24.704
All right.

00:13:24.704 --> 00:13:25.635
I'm gonna set this stone up.

00:13:25.785 --> 00:13:27.435
And every time you look at it,
you're gonna remember all the

00:13:27.435 --> 00:13:28.185
things that God did for you.

00:13:28.185 --> 00:13:28.305
Yeah.

00:13:28.365 --> 00:13:29.204
We'll, worship the Lord.

00:13:29.745 --> 00:13:33.854
Something happened between Joshua's
death and all the elders after him.

00:13:34.635 --> 00:13:38.204
And this time where we're talking
about in Isaiah, something happened

00:13:38.204 --> 00:13:41.834
and I wanna read Judges, which is
the book right next to that two,

00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:43.365
seven through 11, lot shorter text.

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:45.135
And I wanna read this, so judges.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.350
Seven through 11 is this,
the people worshiped the Lord

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.490
throughout Joshua's lifetime.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.930
So it's kind of connecting this piece.

00:13:52.199 --> 00:13:55.890
And during the lifetime of the elders
who lived, Joshua, outlived Joshua,

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.610
and they had seen all the Lord's great
works and what he had done for Israel,

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.390
Joshua's son and nun, the servant of
the Lord died at the age of 110, right?

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.140
We already read that.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.579
They buried him in the territory.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.579
The same thing here, but in the verse
10, it says The whole generation.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.600
Was also gathered to their ancestors.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.160
And after them, a generation rose
up who did not know the Lord and

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.990
the works he had done for them.

00:14:17.199 --> 00:14:19.900
And the Israelites did what was
evil on the side of the Lord and

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.470
they worshiped the balls, and then
it continues to go on from there.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:28.240
So what we see here is right after
Joshua died and all the elders died,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.760
the people begin to reject God again.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.980
Now you may.

00:14:33.824 --> 00:14:36.405
See that you may look back and
say, how could they do that?

00:14:36.614 --> 00:14:39.224
And if you've studied anything in
the Old Testament, God had done so

00:14:39.224 --> 00:14:41.145
many amazing things in their life.

00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:42.675
I'm wanting to connect these pieces.

00:14:42.675 --> 00:14:44.324
There's a lot of work
to connect these pieces.

00:14:44.324 --> 00:14:48.074
If you were here last week, we
talked about how mighty God is.

00:14:48.344 --> 00:14:52.094
We wanna raise the banner of
how God good or how good God is.

00:14:53.145 --> 00:14:57.824
But how quickly are we like the people
of Israel who walk away and we forget

00:14:59.114 --> 00:15:01.155
and we forget and we worship other gods.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.854
And you may say, but
there's no other gods in my.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.530
We're not talking about idols, we're
talking about things that take the place

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.390
of God, the priority of God in our lives.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.410
Connecting this piece to where Isaiah is
and just kind of summarizing this before

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.790
we move on is Isaiah is speaking to a
group of people who obviously rejected

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.190
the Lord and the Lord raised up judges.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.810
To help restore them.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.790
And then they would reject and
restore and all of a sudden

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:24.720
they said, we need a new king.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.700
We, we need a king
actually, is what they said.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.210
So the Lord gave them a
earthly king who failed them.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:33.450
And then David was rose up as
king and he failed them as well.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.480
And all these kings, after
all the way up to a, has.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.490
Is where we are at here, and this is
where we see Isaiah speaking against

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:44.030
the people of Israel who is now two
people because they had broken up

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.870
and divided and saying, judgment is
coming, exile is coming in your life.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.350
But here's the thing that I love about
God and how he speaks through prophets.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.180
He doesn't just speak judgment.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.200
He consistently speaks hope, right hope.

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:01.814
And I, I, I look at this and I, I'm
telling you as, as consistently, I

00:16:01.814 --> 00:16:05.415
want people to know when they cross
the road, if they don't look both ways,

00:16:05.415 --> 00:16:06.435
there's a chance they're getting hit.

00:16:06.439 --> 00:16:10.485
So I want to make sure every
person understands the consequences

00:16:10.485 --> 00:16:11.775
of doing things like that.

00:16:12.165 --> 00:16:16.635
So the consequences of living apart
from God is obviously judgment, where

00:16:16.635 --> 00:16:20.475
sometimes it's where God's going to bring
about punishment and exile you or do some

00:16:20.475 --> 00:16:22.814
different things, but I love the part.

00:16:23.355 --> 00:16:25.395
Of God's word that says
hope, which means this.

00:16:25.395 --> 00:16:30.615
His goal is so, so that we can experience
hope and we can experience life,

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:33.765
and we can experience Jesus the way
that he has called us to experience.

00:16:33.975 --> 00:16:38.084
Just like today when we're gonna talk
about how God is the everlasting God.

00:16:38.089 --> 00:16:39.675
So that's a lot of background.

00:16:39.704 --> 00:16:42.944
I know, but I'm hoping this
helps you understand the Bible.

00:16:43.095 --> 00:16:46.885
I'm hoping, this is my prayer, that the
more and more that we keep referencing

00:16:46.885 --> 00:16:50.564
the Old Testament, you'll go home and
you'll go, I don't remember that story.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:55.020
And you'll begin to jump in and read and
get to know the Bible and understand it

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.860
more because that's how I started is I
just got interested and started studying.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.790
So let's jump in here Everlasting
Father, as he's talking about this,

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.470
what does the Everlasting father mean?

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.030
It may sound logical to you.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.790
Everlasting or eternal father obviously
means lasting or existing forever.

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:13.590
But I want to kind of
clarify a couple things.

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:15.030
Everlasting is this.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.610
Everlasting means always been around.

00:17:18.405 --> 00:17:19.724
Continuous existence.

00:17:20.024 --> 00:17:25.365
So this coming Messiah existed before
time, and it existed at the end of time.

00:17:26.175 --> 00:17:30.885
Then he uses this word father, and he's
not talking about like Father God, right?

00:17:30.889 --> 00:17:34.814
When we think of God the father, he's
thinking father of a new creation.

00:17:35.115 --> 00:17:37.534
When Jesus came to save us from our sins.

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:43.425
Every person that has given their life to
Jesus is now under his kingship, right?

00:17:43.425 --> 00:17:44.775
He is over them.

00:17:44.775 --> 00:17:46.725
He is the one that has
redeemed them and saved them.

00:17:46.725 --> 00:17:50.145
And so he is now the
father of a new creation.

00:17:50.205 --> 00:17:51.705
Those who have given
their lives to Christ.

00:17:52.245 --> 00:17:54.345
And so this is the part where
you guys wondering, Hey, how,

00:17:54.345 --> 00:17:56.535
how can this makes sense to you?

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.455
I, I love getting you
guys en engaged in this.

00:17:58.455 --> 00:17:59.515
So I'm gonna ask a question.

00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:03.465
When you think of father, and this doesn't
have to mean your father, was this to you?

00:18:03.465 --> 00:18:06.075
Cuz I know if times were
coming from broken homes, maybe

00:18:06.075 --> 00:18:07.215
your father wasn't this for.

00:18:07.784 --> 00:18:12.165
But as you're thinking about what a
father should represent or what a father's

00:18:12.165 --> 00:18:14.564
role is, somebody gimme some examples.

00:18:14.564 --> 00:18:16.004
What is a father's role?

00:18:17.985 --> 00:18:18.705
Protector.

00:18:19.034 --> 00:18:19.604
What else?

00:18:20.385 --> 00:18:22.814
Provider guidance.

00:18:24.524 --> 00:18:27.254
Teacher leader.

00:18:28.604 --> 00:18:29.145
Couple more.

00:18:30.195 --> 00:18:31.334
What's love?

00:18:31.334 --> 00:18:32.115
That's awesome.

00:18:32.235 --> 00:18:32.564
What else?

00:18:35.324 --> 00:18:35.445
Strength.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.890
Because I think we could go on and
on and on and on, and at times when

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.590
we, when we think about father, and
again, if you've come from a difficult

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.410
home where maybe your father wasn't
this for you, it doesn't mean that

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.780
isn't what a father's supposed to be.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:55.260
And when we think about the everlasting
or eternal Father, Jesus coming to

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.550
be our father king over our lives.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.410
He is protector, he is provider.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.680
He is caretaker and
teacher, and one who loves.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:10.080
And these are things in which God has
given us to be able to experience.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:16.290
Here's the important part on this side of
heaven, God has really given me a passion

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.980
and a desire to not only preach about
what we'll experience one day in heaven.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.120
Guess what?

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.590
When we get there, we're gonna.

00:19:23.835 --> 00:19:28.575
But right now, I believe
everlasting father means this

00:19:28.785 --> 00:19:30.255
is meant to be experienced.

00:19:30.315 --> 00:19:35.565
Now, every single day, this side
of heaven, we get to walk with

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.755
Jesus an everlasting Father.

00:19:37.965 --> 00:19:41.625
That in the times of struggle
that he is my protector in the

00:19:41.625 --> 00:19:43.605
times of need, he is my provider.

00:19:43.995 --> 00:19:48.885
In the times of not knowing
what to do, he is my teacher.

00:19:49.455 --> 00:19:50.505
He has the wisdom.

00:19:50.505 --> 00:19:52.215
He is all knowing.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:58.350
And I love how this is broken down for us
and how Jesus relates to us in this way.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:03.570
And I, I think this, no matter what we
face in life, we can trust and know that

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:08.159
we have already experienced right now
the everlasting kingdom that God has

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:09.989
given us through relationship with Jesus.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.639
We don't have to wait for heaven.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.899
I, I, I'm, I'm, I'm challenging you
as I challenge myself every day.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.489
God did not save you.

00:20:17.489 --> 00:20:19.080
If you've given your life to Jesus.

00:20:19.379 --> 00:20:20.429
God did not save.

00:20:21.735 --> 00:20:23.835
To just sit there and wait for heaven.

00:20:25.305 --> 00:20:27.405
God saved you for a purpose.

00:20:27.405 --> 00:20:31.905
That's why our church as a whole, we've
said this, we exist to inspire hope,

00:20:31.965 --> 00:20:36.015
the hope of Jesus by helping people
discover God's purpose for their life

00:20:36.255 --> 00:20:37.485
through a relationship with Jesus.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.265
We believe this.

00:20:38.265 --> 00:20:40.665
Every single person that
has breath, good news.

00:20:40.665 --> 00:20:42.045
I've seen every one of you breathe today.

00:20:42.945 --> 00:20:44.385
I know some of you're really tired.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.620
You were breathing, right?

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.370
So if you're breathing, you have
a purpose to fulfill this side of

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.850
heaven for the rest of your life
until you have an eternity with God.

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:57.600
So if you've given your life to Christ,
how do you experience that purpose?

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:03.330
By discovering that through a relationship
with Jesus, that relationship is coming

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:08.189
to know God as everlasting father,
wonderful counselor, mighty God, prince

00:21:08.189 --> 00:21:10.830
of peace, all these different ways.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.730
And that's why we spend time diving
into God's Word, not only on Sundays.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.600
I encourage you to dive into God's
word during the week, and if you're

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.379
struggling to do that, I, I'll just
take a small snippet of your time.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.240
If you need help, I have offered
it and I'll continue to offer it.

00:21:27.629 --> 00:21:28.170
Let me know.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.450
That's not embarrassing
to say, you need help.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.310
What can I do to help?

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.399
Walk through a study with you,
give you some guidance, help

00:21:35.399 --> 00:21:36.780
you stay accountable today?

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.570
And not only me, but we have a
lot of people in our church that

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.710
would love to come alongside.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.180
In the same way.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:42.510
Why?

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:47.190
Because we want to help you
discover God's purpose for your life

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.180
through relationship with Jesus.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.390
That is who we are, and not
just on Sunday mornings.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.260
Guys, what you hear today is
a small snippet of what God

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.140
wants you to experience as a
daily relationship with him.

00:21:59.055 --> 00:22:00.285
Okay, let's not miss that.

00:22:01.485 --> 00:22:05.805
I think so many times when we think about
this relationship with Jesus, we really

00:22:05.805 --> 00:22:07.635
compare it very much to retirement.

00:22:07.695 --> 00:22:10.755
Y'all know this, most of you're probably
preparing for retirement, you're saving

00:22:10.755 --> 00:22:16.275
for retirement, and you're doing all this
work now to one day experience retirement.

00:22:16.725 --> 00:22:19.395
And, and just so you know, like for
me, I started thinking about this.

00:22:19.395 --> 00:22:21.915
I'm like 30 something
years away from retirement.

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:24.165
That's depressing.

00:22:24.975 --> 00:22:27.705
But imagine, imagine.

00:22:30.075 --> 00:22:34.515
If you thought of your relationship
with Jesus that way, man, I'm

00:22:34.515 --> 00:22:37.245
just, I'm just waiting for heaven.

00:22:37.785 --> 00:22:42.285
I'm just really waiting to experience
God as mighty God and, and a

00:22:42.285 --> 00:22:44.115
wonderful counselor and an Everlast.

00:22:44.145 --> 00:22:45.885
I'm just waiting, man.

00:22:45.885 --> 00:22:47.055
How depressing would that be?

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.870
That's, that's not what God saved us for.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.419
That's not what God sent Jesus for.

00:22:54.659 --> 00:22:57.389
God sent Jesus so that we could have life.

00:22:57.689 --> 00:22:58.649
Now.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.939
Okay, I'm excited and I
think two more people are.

00:23:03.179 --> 00:23:09.419
I hope you are excited that Jesus came
so that you can experience life now.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.090
You wanna know why you may not be excited.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:12.929
It's the same way.

00:23:12.929 --> 00:23:14.820
Sometimes I'm not excited when
somebody tells me some good.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.879
We don't fully know what that involves.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.439
And the only way you'll know what
that involves is you start taking

00:23:22.439 --> 00:23:23.909
steps of faith to experience it.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.219
Uh, just full on testimony for me, when
I gave my life to Christ, I was super

00:23:29.225 --> 00:23:31.080
pumped and I'm like, what do I do now?

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.739
And I just started diving in God's
word and, and you want just being

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.070
transparent cuz I know where you're at.

00:23:38.489 --> 00:23:41.100
I got into God's word and, and
half the time I'm like, what is he?

00:23:42.555 --> 00:23:43.485
With these big words.

00:23:43.485 --> 00:23:45.945
I still don't even know how to say some
of these big words, but the more and

00:23:45.945 --> 00:23:48.465
more time I spent with Jesus and the
more and more time I started taking

00:23:48.465 --> 00:23:49.425
steps of faith to say, you know what?

00:23:49.425 --> 00:23:50.385
I'm gonna try to do something here.

00:23:50.565 --> 00:23:51.915
I'm gonna try to talk to somebody here.

00:23:52.035 --> 00:23:53.235
I'm gonna try to invite somebody here.

00:23:53.235 --> 00:23:54.795
I'm gonna try to start
pointing to somebody here.

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:59.325
God begin to help me experience him now.

00:23:59.865 --> 00:24:02.430
And I'm still to this day getting
to experience more and more of God.

00:24:02.655 --> 00:24:08.355
And I pray that as God has inspired
me, that you guys will be inspired

00:24:08.355 --> 00:24:10.215
by God to experience that same.

00:24:11.925 --> 00:24:13.965
That's what God has for us.

00:24:13.965 --> 00:24:17.745
We don't have to wait for retirement to
experience the benefits of God's kingdom.

00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:20.355
And here's the benefits of God's kingdom.

00:24:20.565 --> 00:24:21.645
They're out of this world.

00:24:22.275 --> 00:24:22.935
Just a note.

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:24.765
Okay, so here's the cool part.

00:24:24.765 --> 00:24:27.105
Let's jump into verse seven a
little bit cuz I didn't do much of

00:24:27.105 --> 00:24:28.455
that last week or the week before.

00:24:28.695 --> 00:24:32.625
But verse seven even talks
about his everlasting father

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.155
or his everlasting dominion.

00:24:34.155 --> 00:24:34.965
So here's what he says.

00:24:35.175 --> 00:24:37.935
He says The dominion will be ba.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:38.880
Right.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.230
So when we think of VA larger than
anything, we can think, so his

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:48.360
dominion, his rule, his his ability
to be father is larger than anything

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.370
we can think of or even imagine.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.010
And he says, and its
prosperity will never end.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.590
As you begin to look at this
word prosperity, there's, there's

00:24:55.595 --> 00:24:56.760
two things you begin to look at.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.160
Number one is generosity.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:04.440
And so God has this rain
or this everlasting.

00:25:06.195 --> 00:25:07.935
Well, I say rule or dominion.

00:25:08.115 --> 00:25:09.765
That will be generous.

00:25:09.765 --> 00:25:12.435
God is generous with
everything he's given us.

00:25:12.435 --> 00:25:17.205
These gifts, the desire of hope and
peace and comfort and forgiveness.

00:25:17.535 --> 00:25:21.045
But there's another side of it
that I, I love this prosperity

00:25:21.045 --> 00:25:22.965
actually translates into peace.

00:25:23.415 --> 00:25:24.435
So think about this.

00:25:24.615 --> 00:25:27.915
The eternal father, the
prince of peace, right?

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:32.610
His dominion will be vast and
it will bring about peace.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:34.050
Who, who knows this?

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.600
You, you ever listen
to a, a beauty pageant?

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:38.670
I, I mean, I don't do that every weekend.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.410
That'd be kind of weird.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.960
. I don't know where I'm going with this.

00:25:42.965 --> 00:25:45.240
Okay, , um, you'll, you, you'll get it.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.800
Um, what, what do they say?

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.420
What would you ask for?

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.640
If you could get anything in the
whole wide world, what would it be?

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:52.500
World peace.

00:25:53.145 --> 00:25:56.235
I, I mean, I, I think we all
understand that idea of like, we

00:25:56.235 --> 00:25:57.555
want peace in our relationships.

00:25:57.555 --> 00:25:58.965
We want peace in our finances.

00:25:58.965 --> 00:26:03.885
We want peace in and in just everything
we do, do, do you know that God

00:26:03.885 --> 00:26:09.075
brings about that even in the middle
of chaos, God can bring about peace.

00:26:09.705 --> 00:26:10.515
So let's keep going.

00:26:10.725 --> 00:26:13.215
It says his reign will be
over all of his people, right?

00:26:13.215 --> 00:26:15.915
This is where he says his reign
will be over the throne of David and

00:26:15.915 --> 00:26:18.254
over his kingdom and the throne of
David and over his kingdom is all

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.995
the people that are God's people.

00:26:20.325 --> 00:26:23.835
And then he says, and to
establish and to sustain it.

00:26:24.405 --> 00:26:27.045
So God did not say, Hey, I'm
gonna rule over this kingdom, and

00:26:27.045 --> 00:26:27.975
they just gotta figure it out.

00:26:27.975 --> 00:26:28.754
Here's what he says.

00:26:28.965 --> 00:26:32.595
I'm going to establish it, which
means I'm going to be able to create

00:26:32.595 --> 00:26:36.435
it by dying for people and allowing
them to be forgiven of their sin.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.450
, but then he says, I'm going to
support it, which means, here,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.190
here's the thing, he's our provider.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.520
If you're saying, man, as I begin
to follow Christ, it's difficult,

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.750
I begin to follow Christ.

00:26:45.755 --> 00:26:47.280
It's, I, I'm still trying
to figure this out.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:47.880
You know what he says?

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.480
I'm here.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.790
I will never leave you nor forsake you.

00:26:50.795 --> 00:26:56.190
I will walk alongside you and I will
help you understand how to experience

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.560
more and more and more and more of.

00:26:59.504 --> 00:27:03.435
And then he says this at the end, he
says, from now on until forever, the

00:27:03.435 --> 00:27:05.085
zoo of the armies will accomplish this.

00:27:05.085 --> 00:27:05.415
Right?

00:27:05.534 --> 00:27:11.985
So his reign is from now on and
forever, now on and forever.

00:27:11.985 --> 00:27:15.645
That's the part that I, I'm just telling
you, if you don't take anything else from

00:27:15.649 --> 00:27:22.185
this message, wake up tomorrow and say,
God has has allowed me to experience him.

00:27:22.365 --> 00:27:22.935
Now.

00:27:23.534 --> 00:27:25.665
I don't have to wait for
eternity to experience.

00:27:27.689 --> 00:27:30.899
So unlike the kings of the past,
right, we see that they have

00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:32.490
failed the people of Israel.

00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:36.000
And as we see here in Isaiah,
those kings had le uh, failed at

00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:38.520
leading the charge in following God.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:42.179
And I would say this today, we
are experiencing a struggle of

00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:46.080
leadership across the board, no
matter who you care for, right?

00:27:46.709 --> 00:27:48.810
We do not have good
kings or rulers in our.

00:27:49.995 --> 00:27:50.745
Here's what I know.

00:27:50.745 --> 00:27:55.064
We have one king and one ruler that
is always ruling and guiding us.

00:27:55.125 --> 00:27:58.905
And through Jesus, he gave us a personal
relationship that we don't have to go

00:27:58.905 --> 00:28:01.574
through a king to get to other than Jesus.

00:28:03.614 --> 00:28:06.314
And so as I begin to think through
this, if I pulled this group and asked

00:28:06.314 --> 00:28:09.524
you what you desired this side of
heaven, I believe you would say things

00:28:09.524 --> 00:28:12.554
like peace on earth, blessings upon
blessings in your life, financially,

00:28:12.554 --> 00:28:15.495
relationally, hope, forgiveness.

00:28:16.875 --> 00:28:18.104
But I think at times this is.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.680
You want?

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.760
I, I speak from experience.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.420
I think at times what we do is we
look other places for fulfillment.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.340
We look other places for fulfillment.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.840
We spend mo most of our lives trying other
things to figure out how they fulfill us.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.690
Lemme give you some examples,
number one, you know, if I'll

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.250
just get that next promotion.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.250
I'm just gonna keep working hard
If I get that next promotion and

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.110
get that raise will be great.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.160
Financially will be perfect.

00:28:42.195 --> 00:28:45.645
Can, can I tell you, you're gonna get
on the other side of that promotion and

00:28:45.645 --> 00:28:49.754
the other side of that raise, and you're
still gonna have something missing because

00:28:49.754 --> 00:28:52.905
there's gonna be another promotion that
you need or another raise that you need,

00:28:52.905 --> 00:28:54.524
because some things that you already have.

00:28:54.825 --> 00:28:58.665
Well, sometimes we try to fulfill
ourselves by doing a couple

00:28:58.665 --> 00:28:59.534
of different things, right?

00:28:59.985 --> 00:29:04.185
We try to fulfill ourselves by man, with
our kids and, and don't, don't hate on

00:29:04.185 --> 00:29:06.795
me, but there's sometimes with my kids
when they were younger, I'm like, I just

00:29:06.795 --> 00:29:08.655
wish that they could wipe their own butts.

00:29:08.655 --> 00:29:11.385
I mean, like, Right.

00:29:11.385 --> 00:29:15.225
I mean, they could put on their own shoes
because there's four kids to put shoes on.

00:29:15.555 --> 00:29:16.635
I mean, you guys know
what I'm talking about.

00:29:16.785 --> 00:29:18.105
We, we wish it away.

00:29:18.105 --> 00:29:19.935
And all of a sudden they get to
that point and there's something

00:29:19.935 --> 00:29:20.895
more I wish that they would do.

00:29:20.895 --> 00:29:24.075
And the next thing they know, they're out
of our house and now I'm not fulfilled

00:29:24.075 --> 00:29:25.545
because I wish they were back in my house.

00:29:26.295 --> 00:29:29.355
See, we, we, we, we want the
next thing to fulfill us.

00:29:29.355 --> 00:29:33.285
And those things won't, and I'm not saying
you can't desire those things, but they

00:29:33.285 --> 00:29:35.745
will never fully satisfy us or fulfill us.

00:29:35.805 --> 00:29:35.985
Let.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.280
Go from the side of weight loss.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:42.659
You guys know that I coach, uh, and I
love CrossFit, but you know, at times,

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:47.460
even as a CrossFit coach, I struggle
to ever feel satisfied in my journey.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.060
It's like you lose 20 pounds, but you
still have roles and like, what I gotta

00:29:51.065 --> 00:29:54.409
do, I gotta eat better, I gotta do
more setups, but it just never fully

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.419
satisfies me because this side of heaven,
I'm not gonna have a glorious body.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.530
Now I can pursue those things,
but those things don't fulfill us.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.590
We are never satisfied with
worldly wealth or achieve.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:06.840
So, where am I going with this?

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.460
How can we know Jesus as a everlasting
father and how he can help us

00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:13.260
overcome these fleeting desires?

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.840
And in this season of Christmas
when we're pursuing all these

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.860
other things, but Jesus, how can
we understand the everlasting

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.570
Father can help us overcome this?

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.930
Realizing this, that the kingdom
that has been talked about in God's

00:30:25.935 --> 00:30:28.680
Word is meant to experience now.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:32.399
And if we'll begin to pursue
that relationship, we will

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:33.690
experience a God who gives us.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:40.500
Peace, forgiveness, fulfillment,
contentment, purpose, and as we have

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.080
those fulfillments, it doesn't matter
if we get the Raz or not, doesn't

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.340
matter if we lose the 20 pounds or not.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.400
It doesn't matter if our kids
ever can tie their shoes.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:52.800
We are fulfilled and satisfied in Jesus
because he has changed us, because

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.700
he has given us the ability to have
a hope in the midst of dire struggle.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.890
I mean, you guys know this.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.540
It depends upon the season of life.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.090
Some of you in this room are
dealing with financial struggles

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:06.120
right now, and you have no clue
how you're gonna come out of them.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.030
God does, and God can provide
peace in the midst of that.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:11.820
Some of you are having physical
struggles, you're going to the doctor

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.430
in a couple of weeks, and you're
wondering what is the outcome gonna be?

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.260
And you're wondering, can God be there?

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:16.500
Then?

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.540
Can God be provider then?

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.610
Yes, he can.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.910
God can give you hope
even in the midst of unc.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.520
You may be in this season, and I've
been thinking about this recently.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.790
You may be in this season and you lost a
loved one during this season, and it is

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:33.150
hard to celebrate the season of Christmas
because they're not here anymore.

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:38.760
If you're struggling with grief, God
is present in the midst of that grief.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:44.580
God says that he's the eternal everlasting
father and is present now and forever.

00:31:45.824 --> 00:31:49.574
See when we begin to stop and remember,
and this is the part, if you'll

00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:51.735
remember the part of red, maybe you
didn't cuz you were checking out.

00:31:51.735 --> 00:31:55.635
Cause I was reading so many verses,
but in Joshua, he mentions this

00:31:55.635 --> 00:31:59.715
stone that they set up and every
time you look at this stone, you

00:31:59.715 --> 00:32:01.395
remember what God has done for you.

00:32:02.445 --> 00:32:06.645
We need to start putting stones
in our life so that when we

00:32:06.645 --> 00:32:08.715
struggle is God my provider.

00:32:08.955 --> 00:32:11.475
We'll see that stone and
remember when God was provider.

00:32:12.195 --> 00:32:14.625
And if you're struggling to ever
wonder if God's provided for.

00:32:15.389 --> 00:32:19.649
Sometimes you need somebody else's
testimony to lean on until you have one.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.570
I I, I'm being completely honest with you,
when I was young in my faith, it was hard.

00:32:24.659 --> 00:32:26.699
It was hard to believe
God in some areas of life.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.500
But you know what I
kept hearing people do?

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.600
People were sharing with
me where God showed up.

00:32:30.719 --> 00:32:34.439
I began to reading God's word where God
showed up for David to defeat Goliath.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.879
And I go, you know what?

00:32:35.879 --> 00:32:39.449
If God can do that for them, he can
do it for me and I'm gonna trust him.

00:32:40.814 --> 00:32:41.925
Knowing he will provide.

00:32:41.925 --> 00:32:44.895
And now that I have that testimony
where God has provided, God has

00:32:44.895 --> 00:32:48.675
healed, God has comforted and given
me the ability to forgive, and

00:32:48.675 --> 00:32:50.264
people have forgiven me, praise God.

00:32:50.955 --> 00:32:54.615
Now that I've seen that I need
these stones, these reminders,

00:32:54.705 --> 00:32:56.145
God's word is that stone.

00:32:56.264 --> 00:33:00.254
He is that reminder of who he is for us.

00:33:02.085 --> 00:33:07.155
So let us remember again during Christmas
to not miss out on what God has for

00:33:07.155 --> 00:33:08.745
us through a relationship with Jesus.

00:33:09.345 --> 00:33:12.435
So as we kind of just conclude here,
I know we're, uh, probably even going

00:33:12.435 --> 00:33:16.004
longer because I, I waited that extra five
minutes, but lemme just finish with this.

00:33:16.004 --> 00:33:19.725
Most of us would probably catch
ourselves saying this, that we are

00:33:19.725 --> 00:33:24.105
putting our trust at times in things
of this world that won't last forever.

00:33:24.315 --> 00:33:24.645
Right?

00:33:24.764 --> 00:33:26.235
I go back to that Energizer Bunny.

00:33:26.865 --> 00:33:28.395
There are so many things in our lives.

00:33:28.395 --> 00:33:30.795
We think that our careers define us.

00:33:30.825 --> 00:33:34.755
We think that our money in our account
and how much we have defines us.

00:33:34.755 --> 00:33:37.335
We think our relationships
define us and they don't.

00:33:37.485 --> 00:33:39.885
Those things are good,
but they do not define us.

00:33:40.305 --> 00:33:43.275
The only thing that will define
us is our relationship with Jesus.

00:33:43.425 --> 00:33:47.265
I made this statement last week and
it just sinks in even more cuz I

00:33:47.265 --> 00:33:48.585
ate a lot of junk food last night.

00:33:48.855 --> 00:33:51.885
Do you know whenever you eat junk food,
you do not fulfill, feel fulfilled.

00:33:52.455 --> 00:33:54.315
You feel a lot like what
I feel like this morning.

00:33:55.155 --> 00:33:56.385
I'm dragged down a little bit.

00:33:56.385 --> 00:33:58.515
I just feel like I need some substance.

00:33:58.515 --> 00:34:00.225
I need some steak and some salad.

00:34:00.225 --> 00:34:01.995
Okay, that's what I need this morning.

00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:03.885
You can buy that for me after at noon.

00:34:03.885 --> 00:34:04.275
No, I'm joking.

00:34:04.665 --> 00:34:06.075
But think about this guys.

00:34:06.195 --> 00:34:09.525
When we live our lives for the
world, for the things that will

00:34:09.525 --> 00:34:15.655
never satisfy us, we are missing
out on the best that God has for us.

00:34:17.085 --> 00:34:19.815
And when those things fade
away, where will our faith be?

00:34:19.845 --> 00:34:20.985
Will Jesus be?

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.819
I start thinking back to the story of Job.

00:34:24.569 --> 00:34:28.770
Job is a great example of was God
enough for him when God took away

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.259
everything and God was enough for him.

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:35.520
And so what we have learned over
the last three weeks that Jesus

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.589
is our wonderful counselor, right?

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.520
That he is above anything we could
ever experience, that he will walk

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.679
with us and help us get through
whatever we are going through.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.400
When we think back about last
week that Jesus is a mighty God,

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:50.819
that he defeated death hell in the
grave, and that when we live for.

00:34:51.645 --> 00:34:53.774
We will experience his mighty works.

00:34:53.924 --> 00:34:58.395
When we think of Jesus as everlasting
father, we don't have to wait for eternity

00:34:58.395 --> 00:35:02.895
to experience this relationship that he
can work in and through our lives now to

00:35:02.895 --> 00:35:05.024
experience everything that he has for us.

00:35:05.205 --> 00:35:07.935
And if you wanna know what is
in your inheritance, and so this

00:35:07.935 --> 00:35:08.714
is what everybody wants to want.

00:35:08.834 --> 00:35:12.314
If he's the king and one day we're
gonna experience an inheritance,

00:35:12.375 --> 00:35:13.964
what does that inheritance is?

00:35:13.964 --> 00:35:16.935
Well, we don't have to wait for
eternity to experience that inheritance.

00:35:16.935 --> 00:35:17.745
We get to experience it.

00:35:17.745 --> 00:35:18.044
Now.

00:35:18.194 --> 00:35:18.855
What is it?

00:35:18.975 --> 00:35:19.785
How do I know?

00:35:19.964 --> 00:35:21.225
Go read.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.290
The living will.

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:26.910
The more time that I spend time
in this word, I realize that

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:31.950
God loves me unconditionally,
and sometimes I'm hard to love.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:32.640
Ask my wife.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.400
God forgives me when I
feel like I'm unforgivable.

00:35:39.855 --> 00:35:45.105
God gives me peace in the midst
of circumstances that some of

00:35:45.105 --> 00:35:46.245
y'all would think would be crazy.

00:35:46.245 --> 00:35:51.015
How do you even have peace in the midst of
that and how did I learn the inheritance

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:52.995
that I got by spending time with God?

00:35:54.915 --> 00:36:00.045
Christmas is more than gifts and
Christmas trees, although I love them.

00:36:00.045 --> 00:36:01.695
I think they're beautiful,
and I like enjoying.

00:36:03.015 --> 00:36:05.895
Jesus is the greatest gift we'll
ever receive, and the cool party

00:36:05.895 --> 00:36:09.285
is when the 26th hits and you
guys start returning gifts.

00:36:09.915 --> 00:36:14.355
Jesus is still king when January 1st comes
and it's a new year, and you're wonder

00:36:14.355 --> 00:36:16.275
Man, we're forever away from Christmas.

00:36:16.395 --> 00:36:22.905
Jesus is still king, and his presence
and the presence that he gives us,

00:36:23.595 --> 00:36:25.425
it's available to us every single day.

00:36:26.055 --> 00:36:28.605
Don't miss out on.

00:36:30.135 --> 00:36:32.985
I want you guys to know this, that if
you've come into this room and you have

00:36:32.985 --> 00:36:37.815
not, you're not securing your faith, that
you haven't given your life to Jesus.

00:36:37.815 --> 00:36:41.535
If you've ever wondered, man,
I, I maybe prayed the prayer.

00:36:41.745 --> 00:36:43.095
I, I've went to church.

00:36:43.305 --> 00:36:44.835
I don't know if I've
given my life to Jesus.

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:47.235
Do you know that there's never
been a greater they day than

00:36:47.235 --> 00:36:49.095
today to give your life to Jesus?

00:36:49.755 --> 00:36:52.695
It's simple, and the reason why I say
it's simple is because Jesus did all.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.360
It just takes us confessing our need
for Jesus, repenting of our sins,

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.480
and saying that you trust in him
and that you begin to follow him.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:06.000
And as you do that and you begin to
experience God, you'll never be the same.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.860
And so I wanna invite you to do that.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:11.490
And if you have questions about how to
give your life to Jesus, how to take next

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.000
steps in your faith with Jesus, I'm always
hanging out at the next steps table.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.480
Most of you have my number at this
point, and if you don't come get

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.660
it, I want to share what it means
to have a relationship with Jesus.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:27.149
But here's the other part is that if you
have come in here with a relationship

00:37:27.149 --> 00:37:28.919
with Jesus, what's your take home?

00:37:30.359 --> 00:37:35.069
Go out and experience
everything that God has for you.

00:37:35.759 --> 00:37:40.350
Experience his salvation, his freedom,
experience, his love, his grace.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:43.830
Begin to receive that and
understand that you will get it

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.330
forever more now and forever.

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:48.569
I'm gonna pray for us.

00:37:48.569 --> 00:37:52.740
Lord Jesus, I'm so thankful, Lord,
for you, and I'm so thankful for this

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:57.359
time and your word to understand how
you are an everlasting father, that

00:37:57.359 --> 00:38:02.910
you were born, um, through Jesus, but
Lord Jesus was there in the beginning

00:38:02.915 --> 00:38:04.440
and Jesus is there in the end.

00:38:05.009 --> 00:38:10.980
God, I pray that we do not forget
that you want us to experience in

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:14.609
a relationship with you now, that
we don't have to wait for eternity

00:38:14.609 --> 00:38:16.140
to experience all the glorious.

00:38:16.845 --> 00:38:18.075
Lord, they come with eternity.

00:38:19.545 --> 00:38:22.964
God, I pray that, uh, if there's a
person in this room that is struggling,

00:38:23.805 --> 00:38:27.134
struggling in their faith, maybe
they're struggling to, to, to whether

00:38:27.134 --> 00:38:28.095
they should give their lives to you.

00:38:28.095 --> 00:38:31.395
Lord, I pray that today they choose
to surrender, Lord, whatever it

00:38:31.395 --> 00:38:36.015
is that they need to surrender
in order to, um, come to you.

00:38:37.185 --> 00:38:42.165
God, I pray as well that, um, each one of
us in this room, Lord, that, that we begin

00:38:42.165 --> 00:38:43.785
to just reflect during this time of in.

00:38:45.194 --> 00:38:48.975
That we take time to just say, Lord,
what is it that you would have me

00:38:49.154 --> 00:38:52.395
take home today from this message,
from the worship, whatever it is.

00:38:52.395 --> 00:38:55.754
Lord, I pray that you revealed that
to each person and they begin to

00:38:55.759 --> 00:38:57.915
live that out from this day forward.

00:38:58.785 --> 00:39:01.785
God, you are worthy to be worshiped.

00:39:02.355 --> 00:39:05.535
Uh, Lord, you're worthy to be praised
during the season of Christmas

00:39:05.535 --> 00:39:07.004
because of everything that you did.

00:39:07.575 --> 00:39:10.544
And God, I pray that we don't
leave outta here changed.

00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:12.975
And so Lord, we just pray
this in your heaven name.

00:39:14.535 --> 00:39:14.835
Newman.
