00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.390
I'm excited to continue our
series in 2nd Timothy.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.010
Uh, we have.

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:13.275
And next Sunday that we'll finish
up the book of 2nd Timothy.

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:15.975
Um, and then we will
have our Serve Sunday.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:17.535
And I'll just go ahead and
make the announcement for that.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:18.405
So serve Sunday.

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:19.845
We have a serve Sunday, once a month.

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:22.515
If you haven't been with us, um,
typically we try to do that once a month.

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:27.015
Um, and we're gonna be serving
the Y which means we'll come

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:28.635
and we'll meet here at 10:00 AM.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:30.075
Um, it will look different.

00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:31.395
You won't see anything set up.

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:32.415
We'll have some chairs.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.815
Uh, we'll take some time
to kind of set up the day.

00:00:35.044 --> 00:00:38.285
And then we're gonna have projects
all around the Y M C A of cleaning,

00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:41.015
painting, cleaning a lot of the kids area.

00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:43.415
Um, we're gonna be hauling off
some of the stuff that we've been

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:46.144
moving in and out for them that
they need to some different places.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.985
But we asked the why.

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.815
We said, Hey, what better way to,
to start off the year than to serve

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:54.185
the organization in which we're
partnered with here in our community.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:56.584
So that's why we, um, are gonna.

00:00:57.075 --> 00:00:57.765
uh, doing that.

00:00:57.765 --> 00:00:59.385
So that's two weeks from today.

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:00.765
Uh, 10:00 AM here.

00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:03.735
We'll be serving the Y And one of the
things I love about the, the opportunity

00:01:03.735 --> 00:01:08.385
to serve is when we serve, it's not just
meeting the needs of the Y but I feel like

00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:10.875
that I connect really well with you all.

00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:13.995
Like I get the opportunity to kind
of, what we say, rub elbows, right?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.205
We're, we're on the ground cleaning
something and, and usually I'm like,

00:01:17.205 --> 00:01:18.345
tell me a little bit of your story.

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.775
And, and because I don't get
much time to do that on Sundays,

00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:22.515
and so I really thoroughly.

00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:24.055
Serve Sundays.

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:26.485
And so make sure that you
come ready to do that.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:31.105
Uh, but today as we jump into the
word, we're gonna be in second

00:01:31.105 --> 00:01:36.595
Timothy chapter 4, um, and we'll
be covering the first eight verses

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:38.035
of 2nd Timothy chapter 4.

00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:40.735
Um, and I wanna kind of start
off with this statement.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.495
I usually come up with some kind
of question or pose something and

00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:45.145
trying to kind of draw a point here.

00:01:45.475 --> 00:01:50.075
So how many have you, and I'm assuming
all of you in this situation, has had a.

00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:54.225
Say these things to you, or if you're
a parent, you've said 'em to your kids,

00:01:54.495 --> 00:01:57.135
or they're getting ready to leave and
go do something, and typically you're

00:01:57.135 --> 00:01:58.725
gonna warn them about something.

00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:00.525
Let me, let me give you an example.

00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:02.595
Your kids are getting ready
to walk across the street.

00:02:02.595 --> 00:02:03.105
What do you tell 'em?

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.645
Somebody can answer.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.365
What do you tell your kids?

00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:08.985
Look both ways, and if there's multiple
kids, what do you tell 'em to do?

00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:10.545
Hold hands.

00:02:11.505 --> 00:02:14.984
So parents are doing that because
they're trying to, to protect or warn

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.144
their kids to make sure they watch out.

00:02:17.415 --> 00:02:21.674
Um, I know for us, we, uh, at times
now our kids are at the ages of, uh,

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:27.285
13, 11, 9, and five, and so our 13 year
old can stay home and watch the kids.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.035
And so usually when we leave and go,
like do a, a dinner out, which is

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:33.855
rare for us when we go doing dinner
out, me and my wife Brittany, um,

00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:35.175
we'll tell our daughter Peyton.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.940
Make sure they don't hurt themselves.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.739
Like we're, we're like sitting down.

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:40.609
Look at us.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.470
They can't jump off the furniture.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.500
Um, and so there's things
like that that we'll say.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.570
Um, I remember my mom and
I, I always love this.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.609
Um, my mom's probably watching
the live stream today.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.710
Um, When I was driving, she
would always tell me this,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.270
watch out for the other driver.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.270
I laugh because I'm like, she probably
should have said watch out for myself,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.640
but she said, watch out for the
other driver, because the thing was

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.180
I couldn't control the other driver,
but I could obviously control watching

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.850
out for that driver and I'd look at
those statements as as important.

00:03:08.325 --> 00:03:11.355
Things that we would tell our kids,
or our kids or, or our parents would

00:03:11.355 --> 00:03:15.435
tell us in order to be prepared for
something or to, to make sure that

00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:17.565
we're warned or ready for something.

00:03:17.925 --> 00:03:21.285
Today we're gonna see Paul make a
couple of important statements to

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.865
Timothy, um, to, not to forget.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:28.725
. Um, and, and just to kind of even think
about this, Paul is at the end of his

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:31.365
life, we're gonna even see this today
where Paul is basically saying, I'm

00:03:31.715 --> 00:03:32.685
probably not gonna make it out of this.

00:03:32.925 --> 00:03:36.435
And so these last couple of statements
that Paul's gonna make to Timothy,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.885
art like warnings and, and saying,
Hey, you need to be prepared and

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:42.585
you need to be ready and these are
the things you need to focus on.

00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:46.365
And so Timothy would hear these things
and go, okay, this is in important words.

00:03:46.394 --> 00:03:48.765
So two things we're gonna talk about
today is these important statements.

00:03:48.765 --> 00:03:51.704
Number one, to preach the word,
and number two, to fulfill your.

00:03:52.195 --> 00:03:55.225
To preach the word and
to fulfill your ministry.

00:03:55.644 --> 00:03:58.555
Um, and so these are gonna be statements
that Timothy had heard before.

00:03:58.555 --> 00:04:02.484
He's, he's seen Paul fulfill in his
life, um, where he has preached the word,

00:04:02.484 --> 00:04:03.924
where he has fulfilled his ministry.

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:07.765
Um, but these would be something
that Paul says, I wanna make

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:09.355
sure you don't forget this.

00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:13.495
And again, go back to the example
of every single time our kids rock

00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:15.834
across the road, we're telling 'em
to look both ways and hold hands.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.159
We've told him a hundred times before,
but this is so critical every time,

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.440
cuz we don't want them to get hit.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.429
We, Paul doesn't want Timothy to
miss what God has called him to do.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.460
So just to kind of catch all of
us up, this book was wrote by

00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:33.390
Paul to his true son in the faith
Timothy, that they wasn't his true

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.799
son, but it was his spiritual son.

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.859
And these were some of the last
words that Paul would pin to Timothy.

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.400
And Timothy was dealing with
false teachers in the church.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.810
He was dealing with persecution.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.890
Um, and we know Timothy was timid,
which means he would struggle at

00:04:46.895 --> 00:04:49.260
times to be bold in his faith.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.040
And so, because Paul knew that he wrote
this letter in such a way to be an

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.850
encourager and a reminder to Timothy
and really even the Church of Ephesus,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.380
cuz this letter would be re wrote,
excuse me, read in, um, the church

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.150
as he would be pastoring that church.

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.039
So as Paul's giving this statement to
Timothy, I wanna encourage you that

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.859
Paul is speaking directly to us as well.

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.700
Don't look at this and say, Hey, this is
only to Timothy, this is to all of us.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.060
Um, and so I want us to jump into
this text and then we can kind of just

00:05:18.065 --> 00:05:19.469
start working through it together.
2nd
00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:23.460
So let's jump in 2nd Timothy
chapter 4, starting in verse one.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.960
Paul says, this is Timothy.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.969
I solemnly charge you before God
and Christ Jesus, who is going

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:30.929
to judge the living and the.

00:05:31.645 --> 00:05:36.145
And because of his appearing and
his kingdom, preach the word, be

00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:40.795
ready in season and outta season
rebuke correct and encourage

00:05:41.005 --> 00:05:43.225
with great patience and teaching.

00:05:43.915 --> 00:05:48.205
For the time will come when people will
not tolerate sound doctrine, but according

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.284
to their own desires, will multiply
teachers for themselves because they have

00:05:52.284 --> 00:05:54.235
an itch to hear what they want to hear.

00:05:55.135 --> 00:05:59.815
They will turn away from hearing the
truth and will turn aside to myths.

00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:04.455
But as for you, Timothy,
exercise, self-control and

00:06:04.455 --> 00:06:06.525
everything, endure hardships.

00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:09.075
Do the work of an evangelist
fulfill your ministry?

00:06:09.585 --> 00:06:12.855
For I am already being poured
out as a drink offering, and the

00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:15.135
time for my departure is close.

00:06:15.645 --> 00:06:16.965
I have fought the good fight.

00:06:16.965 --> 00:06:18.195
I have finished the race.

00:06:18.555 --> 00:06:22.305
I have kept the faith there is
reserved for me, the crown of

00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:24.315
righteousness, which the Lord.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.710
, um, which the Lord, the righteous
judge will give me on that day.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.780
And not only me, but to all those
who have loved his appearing.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.560
So let's pray.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.800
Lord Jesus, we pray, Lord, as we jump
into your word, Lord, that your word

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.280
will transform our hearts and our
minds and will empower us to do what

00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:44.190
we have been called to do, Lord, to
fulfill the ministry that you've called

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.789
us to do here at our, our city, and
our church, and in our life's Lord.

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.289
And so we pray this in your heaven name.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.840
So whenever I read over this text, and
you may be doing the same thing, um,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.960
I used to do this before I had started
to ministry and started preaching.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.120
I would see texts like
this and I would go, great.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.890
This text is for pastors and
teachers, and anytime a pastor, a

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.250
teacher preaches it, you guys get
to just sit there and say, amen.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.480
You better do it right?

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.050
Amen.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.159
You better figure out how to do.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.810
. I would say that this text is definitely
true in the fact that it is speaking

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.770
to Timothy who was a pastor of a
church and gonna really be taking

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.200
the reins from Paul in that role.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.360
So he's challenging him
in a couple of ways.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.250
I believe though, as we begin to dive
into this text, I believe that Paul is

00:07:29.255 --> 00:07:34.950
speaking to anyone who has the message of
the gospel anyone has, who has received

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.140
salvation from Jesus, who has the word of.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.280
which means this, that every one
of us is responsible for what we

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.410
know, for what we've received.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.070
And so as, as we're gonna see here
where Paul challenged Timothy to preach

00:07:47.075 --> 00:07:50.520
the word and we'll learn what preach
isn't just this setting right here.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.220
He challenged him to preach the
word and to fulfill his ministry.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.110
I believe wholeheartedly that this
Texas challenging each one of us

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.070
to preach the word and to fulfill
the ministry that God has given us.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.380
So, so please don't miss that part.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.050
Yes, it is Speaking to church
leaders and you'll see me.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.120
Pull out the text in that way, but
we'll also see how it applies to us.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.030
And so as we see these first
couple of words in the text,

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.890
we see how important they are.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.000
Paul didn't just say to Timothy,
Hey, if you want to, if you

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.750
feel like it, you should preach
the word when it's convenient.

00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:25.950
He, he didn't say that.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.950
He says this, I solemnly charge.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:32.625
, when we think about this,
we think of this as passion.

00:08:33.044 --> 00:08:36.105
When Paul is saying this to Timothy,
if, if, if he was in the same room

00:08:36.105 --> 00:08:38.895
with Timothy, he would be doing
the same thing we do to our kids.

00:08:39.135 --> 00:08:40.814
Look us in the eyes
when I'm talking to you.

00:08:41.534 --> 00:08:46.935
I solemnly charge you Timothy
to do these things and, and, and

00:08:46.939 --> 00:08:49.125
again, if we look in this text,
you don't see it wrote that way.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.415
But I would believe if Paul had
bold, he probably would've bolded

00:08:53.415 --> 00:08:54.555
and he would've caps letter.

00:08:55.454 --> 00:08:58.485
These words I solemnly charge you.

00:08:58.964 --> 00:09:02.625
This is how important when we see
this, these words are, and these

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:07.395
challenges are from Paul to Timothy
and I would say even to us today.

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:10.875
So why was this charge so serious?

00:09:11.145 --> 00:09:11.985
Well, let's look in the first.

00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:12.375
First.

00:09:12.555 --> 00:09:16.635
He says, I charge you before God in
Christ Jesus, who's going to judge

00:09:16.635 --> 00:09:19.755
the living and the dead because
of his appearing in his kingdom.

00:09:20.775 --> 00:09:23.954
So when we think about this, God was
going to judge a couple of people.

00:09:23.985 --> 00:09:24.735
Number one.

00:09:25.335 --> 00:09:30.045
Timothy and those who know the
word of God based upon what

00:09:30.045 --> 00:09:30.945
they did with the word of God.

00:09:30.975 --> 00:09:31.785
So I'm gonna say this again.

00:09:31.785 --> 00:09:36.615
God will judge those who have
received the word of God and what

00:09:36.615 --> 00:09:37.365
they do with the word of God.

00:09:37.365 --> 00:09:41.295
So I wanna start with that first
reason why is what we have been given

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:45.615
through faith in Christ is not meant
to be kept, but meant to be given away.

00:09:46.065 --> 00:09:49.965
If we withhold that information from
other people, , then we're withholding

00:09:49.965 --> 00:09:53.595
something that is such precious, not
only to us, but to the whole world.

00:09:53.955 --> 00:09:56.535
And one day at the end of our
lives, we will be judged upon

00:09:56.535 --> 00:09:58.665
that, not judged from a salvation.

00:09:58.995 --> 00:10:01.935
Um, and you know, heaven and
hell situation, we go to heaven

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.705
because of what Christ did for us.

00:10:04.035 --> 00:10:05.625
We're going to be judged upon our works.

00:10:05.715 --> 00:10:08.415
And there's not a ton of clarity
on exactly what we will receive,

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.655
which is rewards for what we do
with the word of the go, the gospel

00:10:11.955 --> 00:10:13.215
and what we don't, but we do.

00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:15.555
That we will be judged upon that.

00:10:15.704 --> 00:10:18.074
There's another part of this, and
this is the second part that I think

00:10:18.074 --> 00:10:19.485
even hinders back to the first one.

00:10:20.564 --> 00:10:22.905
Those who don't hear the
word of God will be judged.

00:10:23.204 --> 00:10:24.255
So I want you to think about this.

00:10:24.344 --> 00:10:28.454
I solemn you charge, charge you
before Christ Jesus who is the

00:10:28.454 --> 00:10:31.875
judge of the living and the dead who
will be appearing in his kingdom.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.655
Think about this.

00:10:33.314 --> 00:10:36.285
Those who don't get the message of
the gospel will be judged one day

00:10:37.185 --> 00:10:39.735
they'll be judged for their sins and
we're talking about heaven and hell.

00:10:39.795 --> 00:10:41.324
We're talking about salvation and.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.340
. And if we just like Timothy, had the
message and we don't proclaim it and

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.300
share it, we are now saying it's okay.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.550
Those we know that don't know the gospel.

00:10:53.555 --> 00:10:55.320
If we're not gonna share it,
we're not gonna share the truth.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.640
It's okay if they go to hell.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.960
No, I, I really think none of us
would truly think that, but at

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.320
times, that's the way we act and
we, we, we disregard the word of God

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.460
and the importance of sharing it.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.030
And, and I say this, all the
reality of this is life or death.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.970
This is life or eternal life or death.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.410
So he's being very serious in this
situation because it is a serious topic

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.800
of understanding the importance of what
he was getting ready to share with him.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.689
And so again, James three, one.

00:11:21.689 --> 00:11:25.800
Speaking of teachers and preachers,
James Three Run re reminds People,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.790
like me says, not many should become
teachers, my brothers, because you

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.630
know that you will receive a stricter
judgment and so you understand this.

00:11:33.689 --> 00:11:38.939
My role as pastor is not to just preach
the truth, but to make sure that I am.

00:11:39.705 --> 00:11:42.765
teaching the church to preach the truth.

00:11:43.485 --> 00:11:46.905
And if I am allowing, I say
allowing, cuz obviously everybody

00:11:46.905 --> 00:11:47.745
can make their own decisions.

00:11:47.925 --> 00:11:54.315
If I'm allowing unfruitful teaching or
ungodly teaching to happen and I'm okay

00:11:54.315 --> 00:11:56.565
with it, then I will be judged upon that.

00:11:56.835 --> 00:12:00.645
And that's a, that's a high,
you know, wait for me at times.

00:12:01.065 --> 00:12:03.735
But I understand the importance
of it and God's word reminds me.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.250
. And so when we think about this, I think
this charge is a reminder to Timothy

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.870
of the responsibility and weight he has
with the truth that can change lives.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.790
When you think about this, somebody name
a couple of jobs that you think are some

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.220
of the most important jobs in the world.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.140
Name a couple of jobs that you
think are some of the most important

00:12:22.145 --> 00:12:23.040
jobs in the whole wide world.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.400
Go.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:30.360
Teachers, doctors, what else?

00:12:31.965 --> 00:12:32.805
Firefighters.

00:12:33.615 --> 00:12:33.795
Wow.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.255
We just had a family back here that's
literally teacher and firefighters.

00:12:36.285 --> 00:12:37.635
So you guys are important to us.

00:12:37.635 --> 00:12:37.995
Thank you.

00:12:38.535 --> 00:12:43.515
Um, when you think about that, we
all have reasons why we say this.

00:12:44.325 --> 00:12:47.685
I would tell you today, and this is
not about my position, this is about

00:12:47.685 --> 00:12:49.155
what Paul says here in his word.

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:56.295
If we're talking about eternal salvation,
I believe teaching the word of God is

00:12:56.295 --> 00:12:58.875
the most important position in the world.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.760
Anybody, anybody with me on this?

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.560
And, and so I'm trying to say, this isn't
just my role, those who know the word of

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.380
God, teaching the word of God, if we're
talking about eternal salvation, eternal

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.189
uh, separation from God or not, I believe
that's the most important role because

00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:19.770
everybody else's role, and again, not to
say that those aren't important is from

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:24.480
this side of heaven, but this is why this
is important, why he's talking about.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.579
So based on this text, it
should be teachers, right?

00:13:29.819 --> 00:13:32.220
So we're gonna kind of answer a couple
of questions as we walk through this.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.860
Number one, what was
Timothy supposed to preach?

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.880
He was supposed to preach.

00:13:36.209 --> 00:13:37.410
What was he supposed to preach?

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.480
Well, we know it's the word of God, right?

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.990
Anything else that's preached that is
not Christ-centered is false teaching.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.660
But I wanna deal with the word
preach first, because again, this

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.340
is probably throwing everybody off.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.329
I'm not a preacher.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.490
You did not walk in here
saying you're a preacher.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.120
Now, some of you may.

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:54.915
, and that's great, but you
may have not walked in here

00:13:54.915 --> 00:13:55.875
thanking yourself as a preacher.

00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:56.745
So what is a preacher?

00:13:57.015 --> 00:13:58.995
A preacher is a herald.

00:13:59.475 --> 00:13:59.895
It's a herald.

00:13:59.895 --> 00:14:03.375
So let me just even describe what that
means so we can even be a little bit more.

00:14:03.615 --> 00:14:08.205
It's one who makes an announcement
of the gospel loud and clear.

00:14:08.205 --> 00:14:09.045
I'm gonna say this again.

00:14:09.225 --> 00:14:16.455
A preacher is a herald, a person who makes
the gospel loud and clear, and I want to

00:14:16.545 --> 00:14:19.695
define those two words, importantly loud.

00:14:20.805 --> 00:14:24.945
Means it comes with words because
I think at times we wanna preach

00:14:24.945 --> 00:14:26.385
the word by the way that we live.

00:14:26.805 --> 00:14:29.535
And I think that's important because
our living should match our words.

00:14:29.895 --> 00:14:33.435
But loud means that people
aren't questioning why you're

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:34.245
living the way you are.

00:14:34.695 --> 00:14:36.795
You are professing why you're
living the way you are.

00:14:36.945 --> 00:14:37.875
Number two, clear.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.985
I think this is so important, and this is
not a knock to any other version of the

00:14:41.985 --> 00:14:44.205
Bible at all, but I'll just tell you this.

00:14:44.205 --> 00:14:48.795
I spent so much time as a kid listening
to the word of God when I didn't underst.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.400
in a version I didn't understand.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.760
I just didn't, and this
is not a knock on K jv.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:54.990
My parents are listening.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.650
They love K jv.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.930
There's some people in here that love
K jv, and I'm not knocking on that.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.190
I'll just tell you this.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.600
I didn't understand it as a kid.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.760
I just didn't.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:07.680
I think it's our role, our role to
take the truth of the gospel and

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.900
to make it clear, loud and clear.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.810
A preacher is one that doesn't
just preach over your head.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.560
It's one that literally breaks
it down into a practical

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.780
makes sense life application.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:24.750
I think that's so important when we think
about what a preacher is a herald is, and

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.595
again, if you can go a little bit deeper,
a Harold has a message and a challenge.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:33.450
To listeners to follow that message
that was handed down by the king.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.630
So most of the time in the old days, a
Harold would be somebody was representing

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:40.320
the King's message, and when he
communicated it, people would listen

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.980
because they knew it was impactful
and it came directly from the king.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.320
We have received a message from King
Jesus to make loud and clear, and

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.821
when we speak, people are to listen
so that God can transform their.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.040
So we see what a preacher is.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.040
It makes a little bit more sense that
that's not just my role, it's, it's

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.110
out all of our roles to be in this.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.060
But then he says, to
preach the word, right?

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.560
The Bible, the truth of the gospel.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.170
It's what the saved and the lost need.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.720
It's what all of us needs
that transforms our life.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.210
So then he goes on a little
bit more in verse two, and he

00:16:12.215 --> 00:16:14.370
says, when should we preach?

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.660
When should we preach?

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:20.280
And he says this, preach the word,
be ready in season and out of.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.250
. What does that mean?

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.670
I remember right after I had surrendered
ministry, I had an old man come up

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.760
to me and he says, Hey, you need to
be ready in season now this season.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.410
And I'm like, it's fall.

00:16:31.469 --> 00:16:31.949
What do you mean?

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.579
He didn't explain himself
and I just kept going on.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.189
Uh, but the more, when I actually
found that it was in the word and

00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:40.170
I understood a little bit more of
it, it makes a little bit of sense.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.220
So in season would be this,
when you're used to being ready.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.300
So I would say even your comfort zone
in season for me would be preaching

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.900
on Sundays in season for me would
be preaching or teaching in a small

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.090
group or around other Christians.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:55.860
just truths.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.180
That's a comfort zone.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.440
That's in season.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:59.670
That's when I'm expected.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.690
I would say this outta season's a
little bit different outta season's.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.680
The one that I think a lot of us probably
aren't prepared for outta season is when

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:13.620
the opportunity isn't favorable, when
it's scary, when it's difficult, when it's

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:17.160
people that don't know Jesus and you begin
to share and they begin to be critical or

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.780
bring up a question you don't know how to.

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:23.879
Just so you know, as a pastor, I
get challenged with questions I

00:17:23.879 --> 00:17:26.609
don't know how to answer, and you
know what I say, I don't know.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.310
And you know what I say, I'll go look.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:30.899
I'll try to go figure it out.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.139
It doesn't intimidate me anymore
because I'm okay with not knowing

00:17:34.139 --> 00:17:38.040
everything because I'm not gonna know
everything, but I'm willing to to listen.

00:17:38.044 --> 00:17:38.270
Right?

00:17:38.639 --> 00:17:41.909
And so it's so important when we
understand the end season outta season,

00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:44.790
I think the outta season is, it's
easier to make excuses in the outta

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.700
season rather than make opportunities.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.560
I'll say that again.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.360
It's easier to make excuses in the
outta season than it is to make

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.330
opportunities, which to mean is
to have the conviction to share.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.450
Paul was the great
example to Timothy and us.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:05.610
Paul shared in the temple easy in
season, but Paul also sh shared

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.670
in the ship that was shipwrecked.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.149
He also shared in the prison
where he was chained to a guard.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.360
Paul was ready in season and outta season.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.750
He was challenged in Timothy to preach
the word in season and outta season.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.840
So how was Timothy supposed to preach?

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:27.750
And this is gonna sound very familiar,
he says, to rebuke correct and encourage

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.520
with great patience and teaching.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.720
If you'll remember from last week,
if you were here, um, in verse 16.

00:18:34.139 --> 00:18:38.520
Uh, of chapter 3, it says this,
all scripture is inspired by God

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.629
and is profitable for teaching
rebuking and for correcting and

00:18:42.635 --> 00:18:43.860
for training and righteousness.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.720
So the word of God is there for
that, but the preacher's role is to

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.190
continue to fulfill that as well.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.610
Right.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.050
To to rebuke.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:52.620
Correct.

00:18:52.649 --> 00:18:55.800
And encourage a little bit about this.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.240
Warren Weby puts it this way.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.560
Maybe it makes a little
bit more sense this way.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.240
We are supposed to preach with
conviction, warning, and a appeal.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.030
I'll explain that a little bit
deeper, but there's another old

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.660
preacher that I don't have the name
of who this is, but he had said this.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:15.180
He says, we should afflict the comfortable
and we should comfort the afflicted.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.410
Now I wanna dive a little bit
deeper in that and this idea of if

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.630
there's conviction without remedy.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.580
Then we add to people's burdens.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.110
Let me just give you this
secret, great example.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:30.030
If as a preacher or as a herald
or as a friend, you go to someone

00:19:30.035 --> 00:19:33.330
and say, you're living in sin,
you're doomed and going to hell.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:39.750
Good luck, conviction, without any
help, you just added to their burdens.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:40.890
Okay?

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.600
Now let's flip the other side here.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.810
If we encourage those, we ought to rebuke.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.470
We are assisting them to sin,
which means this, Hey, it's okay.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:50.970
You just keep doing, you.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:53.580
You're great.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:54.390
Just keep it up.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.970
You're encouraging them, but
you're encouraging them to sin.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.760
So there needs to be a
balance between this, right?

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.750
A balance between this.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.210
So a person who teaches or preaches God's
word, I believe as we look at this, we

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.520
need to let the word of God do the work.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.800
And this is where I go back to verse 16.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.560
I wanna try to connect these two
pieces as much as I can, because

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.910
it really kind of was an aha moment
to me as a teacher, as a person who

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.010
shares the word of God to others.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:21.360
Think about this.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:28.260
If the word of God is inspired and is
profitable for teaching rebuking and

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:35.159
correcting on its own, then as a preacher,
my role is to preach the gospel, the

00:20:35.165 --> 00:20:37.169
truth of the word, and get out of the way.

00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:42.570
See, I think at times, and you guys may
do the same thing, we think when we share

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.360
truth, we have to add something to it.

00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:51.525
I think this is really just Paul saying
take the word, which is already truth,

00:20:51.735 --> 00:20:56.145
which is inspired by God, which is
there to correct rebuke and encourage.

00:20:56.925 --> 00:20:57.915
Let it do its work.

00:20:59.385 --> 00:21:00.525
Let it do its work.

00:21:00.975 --> 00:21:02.025
So I prayed.

00:21:02.205 --> 00:21:03.014
I prayed yesterday.

00:21:03.014 --> 00:21:06.315
I prayed today, and I'm gonna pray
every day forward that I preached the

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:13.514
word and I get out of the way because
it's not about me, it's about him.

00:21:14.505 --> 00:21:18.735
It's about his power and his abilities,
and the reason why, I'm just telling

00:21:18.735 --> 00:21:20.655
you, I'm, I'm in the seat with you.

00:21:21.615 --> 00:21:25.635
I don't share as much as I should because
I'm afraid I'm gonna say the wrong thing.

00:21:26.295 --> 00:21:29.025
I'm afraid I'm not gonna
have the right answers.

00:21:30.795 --> 00:21:32.145
And that's what I bring to the table.

00:21:34.545 --> 00:21:36.135
God already brought
everything to the table.

00:21:36.735 --> 00:21:37.425
We just have.

00:21:38.024 --> 00:21:39.405
The call to go share it.

00:21:39.915 --> 00:21:42.585
Isaiah 55 11 says this, and
this is what encourages me.

00:21:42.825 --> 00:21:48.885
So my word that comes from my mouth
will not return to me empty, but it

00:21:48.885 --> 00:21:53.504
will accomplish what I please and
prosper and what I send it to do.

00:21:54.915 --> 00:21:57.615
When you share God's word,
it does not return void.

00:21:58.335 --> 00:21:59.325
It does not return void.

00:22:00.284 --> 00:22:02.805
So I wanna kind of go back
over these words because

00:22:02.805 --> 00:22:03.825
everybody wasn't here last week.

00:22:03.825 --> 00:22:06.905
So when he says, as a
teacher, as a preacher, to re.

00:22:07.755 --> 00:22:10.065
. Most of us think that is so bad.

00:22:10.065 --> 00:22:11.055
That's judgemental.

00:22:11.055 --> 00:22:12.525
All we're doing is judging people.

00:22:12.525 --> 00:22:16.425
When we're rebuking people with the word
of God, let me try to encourage you with

00:22:16.425 --> 00:22:17.835
a different way of thinking about it.

00:22:18.195 --> 00:22:19.065
Think about it this way.

00:22:19.425 --> 00:22:24.495
When we are rebuking people, it's
really disappointing out where

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.915
people have not only fallen short,
but where they've missed out on

00:22:27.915 --> 00:22:29.145
experiencing God's best for their.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.210
I, I've, I've asked this several
times to many of you, and I will

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:37.080
continue to ask other people, do
you want God's best for yourself?

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.300
God's intended plan for your life to
experience the greatest thing ever?

00:22:42.305 --> 00:22:47.670
If that is true, you want that for
other people, and if you do, you

00:22:47.675 --> 00:22:51.120
will rebuke or you will point out
where maybe they're missing that

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.340
opportunity to experience God's best.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.930
Then there's the correcting piece, because
again, if we rebuke them and we don't

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.020
give them any, , what good does it do?

00:23:01.679 --> 00:23:04.620
So when we correct, we point
in the right direction.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.429
If somebody's going the wrong direction,
and you know it, I'm pretty sure you

00:23:08.435 --> 00:23:11.459
guys are nice people, you're not gonna
keep laughing and pointing and saying,

00:23:11.459 --> 00:23:15.870
ha ha ha, you're gonna, Hey, did you know
you're, you turned left rather than right?

00:23:16.889 --> 00:23:17.189
I don't know.

00:23:17.189 --> 00:23:20.610
That's what I would say correcting
is, is really helping people get

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.330
back on track to point them to Jesus,
to point them to the grace and the

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.379
mercy and forgiveness that God.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.139
But then this, there's word encouragement.

00:23:28.409 --> 00:23:30.480
I love the word encouragement.

00:23:30.899 --> 00:23:31.500
I really do.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.750
And when I started studying about him,
it's to strengthen and to comfort people.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.320
And even if you dive a little bit
deeper, to encourage us to inspire

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.120
someone to accept Jesus, and to
follow him, to accept his forgiveness.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.000
And even if you look at the word
encouragement, and I'm gonna share another

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.560
quote with you, which I've shared before.

00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:52.560
Think about encouragement this way
when you're encouraging people.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.560
You're encouraging them,
you're pleading with them.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.850
You're begging with them not to reject
Christ, but to accept his hope and

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.909
his forgiveness and to experience
the life that God has for him.

00:24:03.899 --> 00:24:05.580
I've read this before, but
I wanna share it again.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.949
Charles Spurgeon made the
statement and I believe.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.800
Wholeheartedly that we will
be a church that does this.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.720
If sinners be damned, at least let
them leap to hell over our bodies.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:21.030
And if they perish, let them
perish with our arms about their

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.100
knees, imploring them to stay.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.350
And if hell must be filled, at least
let it be filled with the teeth of

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:31.500
our exertions and let no one go there.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.730
Unw warned or un prayed for.

00:24:34.199 --> 00:24:39.600
That statement by Charles Burgeon
is a, a statement of encouragement.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.480
It's a statement of desperation for those
around us, not that we are judging them.

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.620
I, I need you to hear this
statement when we rebuke.

00:24:49.155 --> 00:24:49.905
And correct.

00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:51.254
It's not outta judgment.

00:24:51.525 --> 00:24:55.275
It's outta mercy because you don't
wanna see them, miss the opportunity

00:24:55.275 --> 00:24:59.295
to experience a living savior, a
God that loves you now, and a God

00:24:59.295 --> 00:25:01.695
that wants to love you for eternity
and spend eternity with you.

00:25:01.935 --> 00:25:08.045
That is the heart of why we
preach the word, even as regular

00:25:08.175 --> 00:25:10.485
day Christians, cuz again, don't
just think that this is my rule.

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:12.555
Why do we share the truth of the gospel?

00:25:12.555 --> 00:25:13.785
Why do we share what we know?

00:25:14.085 --> 00:25:17.045
Because we want to see people know Jesus.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.155
because if we've known Jesus,
then we want others to know Jesus.

00:25:22.995 --> 00:25:24.645
And he says this, he continues on right.

00:25:24.855 --> 00:25:30.405
He says, to rebuke correct and encourage
with great patience and teaching

00:25:31.605 --> 00:25:33.345
great patience is long suffering.

00:25:34.125 --> 00:25:34.815
Long suffering.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:35.625
Think about this.

00:25:35.865 --> 00:25:37.815
Sometimes you don't see immediate results.

00:25:38.595 --> 00:25:39.405
I would say this.

00:25:39.645 --> 00:25:44.505
My wife married me and I was not a
believer and she was probably not a

00:25:44.505 --> 00:25:45.915
smart thing to do, not suggesting.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:48.150
But she was patient with me.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.160
She wanted me to know Jesus.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:54.870
She wanted me to go to church, but
I didn't go and I rejected Christ.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.050
But she was patient with me and
she was long suffering, and I'm so

00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:59.250
thankful she didn't give up on me.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.930
I, I, I think of stories that I've heard
in this church where we've heard a couple

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:07.830
of families come up and tell us, Hey,
Ben and I usually make this statement.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:12.390
We were waiting on you on the other side
of your obedience to move from Oklahoma

00:26:12.395 --> 00:26:15.870
and to plan a church and to spend your
life committed to sharing the gospel.

00:26:16.605 --> 00:26:21.764
And when we hear that, I remember the
moments of going, nothing's happening.

00:26:22.635 --> 00:26:23.865
We're sharing, we're inviting.

00:26:23.865 --> 00:26:26.774
Nobody's showing up, nobody's
life's being changed.

00:26:27.615 --> 00:26:31.695
We, we suffered long to
experience life change.

00:26:33.435 --> 00:26:36.345
That's why we can't just rebuke
correct and encourage and

00:26:36.345 --> 00:26:37.845
expect in an instant change.

00:26:38.024 --> 00:26:39.855
There are some people that will change.

00:26:39.945 --> 00:26:42.735
There are some people that will give
their lives to Christ like that, but

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.815
there are many that we are going to
have to suffer long and be patient with

00:26:47.895 --> 00:26:50.685
because we care so much about them.

00:26:51.405 --> 00:26:54.225
And that is difficult,
but it is rewarding.

00:26:54.794 --> 00:26:57.794
Maybe one day someone will say the
same thing to you because you are

00:26:57.794 --> 00:27:01.575
patient and you are committed to
rebuking correcting and encourag.

00:27:02.865 --> 00:27:04.305
He also says to teach, right?

00:27:04.305 --> 00:27:08.085
And what that means is to be
consistent, to teach the word of God.

00:27:08.385 --> 00:27:11.235
You'll even hear this word doctrine,
and a lot of times doctrine confuses

00:27:11.235 --> 00:27:15.195
the heck outta me because it's like
I don't think in big words and deep

00:27:15.195 --> 00:27:18.075
theological things, and that may not
sound deep to you because it makes sense.

00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:19.935
Doctrine is just the truth of God.

00:27:20.535 --> 00:27:21.795
It's really just the truth of God.

00:27:21.885 --> 00:27:28.395
So teach God's truth, if you have His
word, it's easy to teach it simple enough.

00:27:30.495 --> 00:27:33.165
So what's the reason why Paul
would give this challenge to

00:27:33.165 --> 00:27:34.755
Timothy to teach the word?

00:27:34.815 --> 00:27:37.365
Why would he give this challenge
to us to teach the word?

00:27:37.365 --> 00:27:39.375
The next couple of verses are important.

00:27:39.795 --> 00:27:43.515
Three and four says this, for the time
will come when people will tolerate

00:27:43.515 --> 00:27:47.325
sound doctrine will not tolerate
sound doctrine, but according to their

00:27:47.445 --> 00:27:51.015
own desires, will multiply teachers
for themselves because they have an

00:27:51.015 --> 00:27:52.965
itch to hear what they want to hear.

00:27:53.355 --> 00:27:58.065
They will turn away from hearing the
truth and will turn aside to myths.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.050
I'll just tell you this, you know what
hurts a pastor's heart the most is when

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:06.720
you see somebody walk away from the
church, walk away from their faith.

00:28:07.379 --> 00:28:10.980
Uh, I've been to ministry long enough
where I've seen that, um, we, we had

00:28:10.985 --> 00:28:13.020
a a, a, it's crazy how this works.

00:28:13.379 --> 00:28:16.080
Somebody who deeply invested in me
in Britain early on in our ministry,

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:20.790
I believe was a critical part to me
coming to faith in Christ, not short,

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:24.390
after I gave my life to Christ for
into ministry, he left the church.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.389
Wouldn't answer text messages,
wouldn't answer phone calls.

00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:31.500
So saw him two, three years later,
one day at a funeral and uh, I broke

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.659
down and I'm like, what happened?

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.270
And he had wrestled through a lot
of things that nobody knew about.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.620
and he was struggling and that broke me
because even to this day, I don't fully

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.120
know if he's ever come back to the church.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.540
Um, and, and I think about this
instance, when we look at people

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.030
that fall away and they fall away
for various reasons, I don't believe

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.650
his was because of false teaching.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.930
I think there was a lot of brokenness
that he didn't really have anybody

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:53.490
to, to walk through that with.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.430
And I'm, I'm hurt over that, uh, for him.

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.690
Um, but I, I think of this as, as
this instance though specifically,

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.130
are people who knew the.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.350
but didn't like it.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:05.580
So let me give you some examples here.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:09.480
Paul says that there were people that
were basically fed up with sound teaching

00:29:09.929 --> 00:29:14.129
that contradicted their lifestyle, right?

00:29:14.129 --> 00:29:15.000
They contradicted their lifestyle.

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.020
I wanna live this way.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.250
God's word says this.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.820
I'm gonna go find somebody else
That affirms my lifestyle so

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.990
that I feel good about myself.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:27.540
I, I'm just telling you, if, if you
think that that's a good thing, why did

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:31.889
our parents, at times, we wanted to do
things as, as kids, but our parents.

00:29:34.169 --> 00:29:36.929
Tell us truth and they would say,
no, you should not do this, and,

00:29:36.935 --> 00:29:39.810
and we didn't want to because we
wanted to do what we wanted to do.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:41.370
Many times they were saving us.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.459
They were protecting us from
something we weren't aware of.

00:29:45.629 --> 00:29:48.629
Also, as he says, they'll begin
to find people who will not rebuke

00:29:48.659 --> 00:29:52.050
correct or encourage them, but again,
support their lifestyle of sin.

00:29:52.439 --> 00:29:55.500
They'll have an itch to hear what
they want to hear, and they'll go

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.610
find somebody that can scratch.

00:29:57.965 --> 00:29:58.110
right?

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:01.290
Let me just give you some practical
examples, and usually you won't see these

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:05.700
words clearly come out in a ministry role
that's supporting people who they, who

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:10.350
are, are obviously veering from the truth,
but typically this is what they're saying,

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:14.520
Hey, living a lifestyle how you want
during the week is okay, as long as you

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.980
come to my church and as long as you give.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.110
If you do those two things, I really
don't care what you do during the week.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.080
Now, you probably have never been a part
of a church that says that from the.

00:30:23.745 --> 00:30:26.745
, but basically they communicate
it through their services and

00:30:26.745 --> 00:30:27.645
the way that they do things.

00:30:28.065 --> 00:30:29.175
Let me just give you another one.

00:30:29.534 --> 00:30:30.735
Hey, we're all sinners.

00:30:31.185 --> 00:30:32.085
God's grace covers them.

00:30:32.085 --> 00:30:32.504
All right?

00:30:32.534 --> 00:30:33.465
So just keep on sinning.

00:30:34.575 --> 00:30:35.415
It doesn't matter how you live.

00:30:35.415 --> 00:30:36.014
Just keep going.

00:30:36.495 --> 00:30:38.565
I mean, God's gonna forgive you right now.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:39.075
I would agree.

00:30:39.075 --> 00:30:43.095
We're all sinners and God forgives
us, but he is also there to

00:30:43.095 --> 00:30:44.504
rebuke correct and encourage.

00:30:44.985 --> 00:30:46.215
To experience God's best.

00:30:46.365 --> 00:30:49.004
This last one may stick a
little bit more to home.

00:30:49.245 --> 00:30:50.264
Hey, don't study the word of God.

00:30:50.385 --> 00:30:50.985
That's my role.

00:30:51.135 --> 00:30:51.735
That's a pastor.

00:30:52.155 --> 00:30:53.264
That's my role as a priest.

00:30:53.595 --> 00:30:54.524
You leave that to me.

00:30:55.635 --> 00:30:56.595
I'll tell you how to think.

00:30:57.585 --> 00:31:00.825
And for some of you that may be easier
because you don't have to do all the

00:31:00.825 --> 00:31:03.435
labor of being in the word I tell you.

00:31:03.675 --> 00:31:06.014
If you ever hear that from me,
smack me and kick me outta the pulp.

00:31:07.425 --> 00:31:09.885
The word of God is meant
for all of us to get.

00:31:11.715 --> 00:31:14.895
Every one of us to have a personal
relationship with Christ through his word.

00:31:15.285 --> 00:31:21.075
My role is to be a leader in helping
encourage you get in the Word as a church,

00:31:21.075 --> 00:31:25.905
we inspire hope by helping you discover
God's purpose for your life through a

00:31:25.905 --> 00:31:30.495
relationship with Jesus, not through
your relationship with me to Jesus.

00:31:31.755 --> 00:31:32.505
You need to know that.

00:31:33.165 --> 00:31:36.735
So these are just some of the things
that these people were falling away to.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.180
As we look back in chapter 3 of
Timothy and the first nine verses, these

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.750
were people who were living the selfish
life, who cared more about themselves

00:31:45.755 --> 00:31:47.310
and their desires than God's desires.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:50.760
Now, I, I need to tell you this, and
somebody probably needs to hear this.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.570
Jesus died to set you free from
sin not to continue to live in it.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.890
When we are choosing these other
ways of life, we want to continue

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.950
to live in it, and Jesus came to
set you free from that burden.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.090
Yes, everyone of us is a
center of need of a savior.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.635
, but he did not say that he was gonna
save us and leave us where we're at.

00:32:11.025 --> 00:32:12.855
He said he was gonna
save us to transform us.

00:32:14.145 --> 00:32:16.125
And I'll just give you one more
example before I move on here.

00:32:16.545 --> 00:32:20.055
I think about my kids at times and you
guys hear so many examples from my kids.

00:32:20.985 --> 00:32:25.695
My kids will get sick and there's
medicine, they need to make them

00:32:25.695 --> 00:32:30.045
well, but they fight me because
they don't like it cuz it's nasty.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:34.770
It's the, the bubble gum flavor they
don't like or whatever, but it's nasty.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.290
They don't want it, and they
fight me and they kick and scream.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.820
As a parent, how smart would it be for
me to say, no, you don't have to take it.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.160
Continue living in your sickness.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:44.790
You'll be okay.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:48.660
Is that not what the church's role is?

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.420
That not what the word of God's role is?

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:55.230
To, to be able to bring
something that is there to heal.

00:32:56.145 --> 00:32:58.965
. And yes, at times the people in
which you share with will kick

00:32:58.965 --> 00:33:01.755
and scream and will begin to say,
oh, you're just one of those.

00:33:01.755 --> 00:33:02.655
Jesus thumpers you.

00:33:02.745 --> 00:33:05.835
You just want to push the, your
truths on, and you just wanna be no.

00:33:05.835 --> 00:33:11.895
And like, no, I understand
where you've been and you don't

00:33:11.895 --> 00:33:12.975
have to continue to be there.

00:33:14.895 --> 00:33:18.525
I, I'm telling you that's different
view than sometimes what we think

00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:19.665
of when we share truth with other.

00:33:20.775 --> 00:33:23.535
So I'm gonna move on, and I know I'm
running outta time here, but the second

00:33:23.535 --> 00:33:27.105
challenge that Timothy was given, and
we were given not only to preach the

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:28.965
word, but to fulfill your ministry.

00:33:28.965 --> 00:33:31.785
I want you to key in on that
word, your ministry, and we're

00:33:31.785 --> 00:33:32.955
gonna expand on that even more.

00:33:32.955 --> 00:33:34.335
And I think that's so important.

00:33:34.455 --> 00:33:35.775
He says to fulfill your ministry.

00:33:35.775 --> 00:33:39.735
So let's look at this, but as for you,
exercise self-control and everything.

00:33:39.735 --> 00:33:43.815
Endure hardship, do the work of
an evangelist and fulfill your.

00:33:44.879 --> 00:33:48.570
He's telling Timothy to not
get distracted by all the false

00:33:48.575 --> 00:33:52.389
teachers around him trying to stop
him from fulfilling his ministry.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.500
I think at times, cuz I need to hear this.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.850
I catch myself looking around at
other ministries and wondering

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:01.169
what God is doing there.

00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:02.430
Why isn't God doing that here?

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:03.300
Why?

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.760
Why is God using me differently
than God's using them?

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.850
And you know what God is
telling me all the time.

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:12.929
Fulfill your ministry, Ben, yours.

00:34:13.694 --> 00:34:16.334
Me and Megan just had this
conversation, fulfill your ministry.

00:34:17.114 --> 00:34:18.794
I think that that is so powerful.

00:34:18.799 --> 00:34:21.734
That word your because Yes,
and I want to explain this.

00:34:21.884 --> 00:34:23.384
Every one of us has a ministry.

00:34:24.794 --> 00:34:25.844
To follow Jesus.

00:34:25.995 --> 00:34:27.044
This is, this is everybody.

00:34:27.044 --> 00:34:31.634
Follow Jesus right to, to not only follow
him, but to serve in such a way that

00:34:31.634 --> 00:34:35.264
glorifies him and serves others, to invite
others into a relationship with Jesus.

00:34:35.264 --> 00:34:39.074
These are all general fulfilling
ministries, but I believe God

00:34:39.074 --> 00:34:42.014
has called every person in this
room, every person in the world to

00:34:42.014 --> 00:34:43.634
fulfill the ministry in their life.

00:34:43.634 --> 00:34:44.355
God has gifted.

00:34:45.509 --> 00:34:48.509
. God has given you a story and
it may be a difficult story.

00:34:48.509 --> 00:34:49.290
You need to know this.

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:53.549
God has sometimes given some of you
difficult stories, but he's given you

00:34:53.549 --> 00:34:55.770
that story to fulfill your ministry.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:58.560
Not my ministry, not mad.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.690
And Amanda's ministry, not
anybody else is in here.

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.680
Your ministry, and I'm just gonna
tell you, if you wanna know what your

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.950
ministry is, it starts with God's.

00:35:09.495 --> 00:35:13.194
To give you direction and
comfort in your ministry.

00:35:13.455 --> 00:35:15.674
For Timothy's, it was persecution.

00:35:15.855 --> 00:35:18.765
It was his, what we know, his
personality of being timid.

00:35:19.004 --> 00:35:19.995
That wasn't Paul's issue.

00:35:19.995 --> 00:35:21.044
Paul was bold.

00:35:21.705 --> 00:35:23.355
Paul's was a little bit
of a different ministry.

00:35:23.355 --> 00:35:26.535
Yet he fulfilled it and we're gonna
see how he shows that example.

00:35:26.924 --> 00:35:29.915
And he says this, and I think
this is so important, he says, to

00:35:30.355 --> 00:35:32.265
exercise self-control in everything.

00:35:32.355 --> 00:35:34.125
Why did Timothy need to exercise self?

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.089
What this means in every situation,
we need to be aware of one, those

00:35:39.089 --> 00:35:41.430
around us who are trying to distract
us from fulfilling our ministry.

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.180
But number two, there are people
watching, and this is not for you

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:49.485
to act perfect, but this is for you
to know the responsibility that you

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:54.509
have as a Christ follower for people
to see you exercise self-control.

00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:56.310
Let me give you a great example.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.819
Yesterday, I'm in here helping set
up all along with my kids and a

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.680
pipe balls and hits me in the head.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.230
I think I might have a concussion.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.740
I don't know.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:07.980
I, my head hurts in that moment.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.359
I'm telling you, not many years ago,
I would've probably cussed, kicked

00:36:12.359 --> 00:36:15.210
those things and got mad at my kids,
even though my kids didn't do it.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.200
That's just me.

00:36:16.859 --> 00:36:22.230
But the moment that thing hit me in the
head, I'm like, I have kids around me.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:23.609
I also.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.620
That wasn't anybody's fault.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.549
This is a freak accident.

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:27.690
I'm not gonna blame God.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:28.560
I'm not gonna cuss.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.610
I'm not gonna kick it.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.600
Anger's not gonna help me.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.029
I mean, seriously, all those thoughts are
running through my head, while my head

00:36:33.035 --> 00:36:35.430
is pounding, self-control and everything.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.509
Am I perfect?

00:36:36.509 --> 00:36:39.000
Trust me, ask Brittany, my
wife, she'll tell you I'm not.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.220
That was just one where I
did exercise self-control.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.980
But it's important because there are
people around us that are watching.

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.509
Number two, he says, endure hardship.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:46.740
Endure hardship.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.069
Those who call themselves religious.

00:36:51.674 --> 00:36:55.305
Will claim that if you're religious
enough, you won't endure hardship.

00:36:56.174 --> 00:37:00.734
But Paul's telling you, you will
endure hardship in the midst of

00:37:00.734 --> 00:37:02.115
trying to fill your ministry.

00:37:02.504 --> 00:37:03.165
You will.

00:37:03.435 --> 00:37:05.774
And so he is saying,
endure, make it through.

00:37:06.044 --> 00:37:06.825
You got this.

00:37:06.825 --> 00:37:08.865
And again, Paul set the great example.

00:37:09.134 --> 00:37:10.814
He says, do the work of an evangelist.

00:37:10.964 --> 00:37:15.464
And I think this is so important, just so
you know, when it comes to fulfilling our.

00:37:17.295 --> 00:37:20.895
we can get so individualized in
when we think about this, lemme

00:37:20.895 --> 00:37:21.795
just give you a great example.

00:37:22.095 --> 00:37:24.615
Whenever I'd first given my life
to Christ, I began to dive into

00:37:24.615 --> 00:37:26.775
the word and I began to think
about how the word applied to me.

00:37:26.775 --> 00:37:27.855
And again, that was good.

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:33.345
But over time, if the ministry only
stayed focused on me, I missed the

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:37.485
greatest call that God had given me to
fulfill my ministry, which is demean,

00:37:37.605 --> 00:37:42.075
to share the word of God, to to share
with those who don't know Christ.

00:37:42.075 --> 00:37:43.485
And with with Timothy, this would be.

00:37:44.355 --> 00:37:46.905
There's gonna be those in the
church that question your ministry.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:51.285
Timothy, don't get caught up in all
these meetings with them because there's

00:37:51.285 --> 00:37:52.605
people out there that need Jesus.

00:37:53.535 --> 00:37:55.695
Do the work of an
evangelist, share the gospel.

00:37:55.695 --> 00:37:56.625
Go be focused on this.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:59.895
And I would say this, the burden
for the lost should be an important

00:37:59.895 --> 00:38:01.755
part of the ministry of the church.

00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:07.065
And in three weeks, we're gonna
spend four weeks together as a church

00:38:07.395 --> 00:38:09.555
talking about practical evangel.

00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:14.924
I've had a burden to be able to discuss
this topic with the church because

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:16.845
a lot of times evangelism scares us.

00:38:18.705 --> 00:38:22.484
It scares me, but we're gonna look at
how the word of God teaches us how to

00:38:22.484 --> 00:38:26.834
be practical and how we share the gospel
and how we do the work of an evangelist.

00:38:27.285 --> 00:38:30.794
Then the last one again, he says,
to fulfill your ministry, and again,

00:38:30.794 --> 00:38:32.234
don't miss that idea of the word.

00:38:33.105 --> 00:38:37.005
Don't get distracted by looking across
the room and comparing your ministry

00:38:37.009 --> 00:38:39.015
or your ministry roles to others.

00:38:39.015 --> 00:38:40.215
I need to say this again.

00:38:40.485 --> 00:38:44.745
Your call to fulfill your ministry
is not about comparing yourself

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:45.975
to the person sitting next to you.

00:38:46.785 --> 00:38:50.025
God has placed them where he
has placed them for their call.

00:38:50.565 --> 00:38:54.015
Now, you can encourage each other
in the general places of ministry,

00:38:54.645 --> 00:38:57.465
but at times, I'm telling you, you,
you're gonna start feeling like

00:38:57.465 --> 00:38:58.745
you're more spiritual than somebody.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.120
Because of what you're doing.

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:03.090
And some of you, and I get it,
some of you gonna feel like you're

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:06.900
not spiritual enough because you
don't have somebody else's gifts.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:11.010
Guys, I spend the majority of
my ministry time around way more

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.390
people that are gifted to me.

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:13.680
I mean, what was it?

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.050
Jason was telling me something
I think, I don't remember.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:20.190
I think it was him telling me something
about how something that works with tech

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:22.410
and I swore he talked to me in a foreign.

00:39:24.285 --> 00:39:26.295
And I went, go fulfill your ministry.

00:39:26.295 --> 00:39:29.025
Like that means seriously, like I'm
not gonna compare myself to Jason.

00:39:30.464 --> 00:39:34.305
It doesn't make sense to me and it's
not what God's calling us to do.

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:36.255
He says, fulfill your ministry.

00:39:37.484 --> 00:39:38.565
And I love this.

00:39:38.955 --> 00:39:42.415
Paul gives an example of how he fulfilled
his ministry in verses six three.

00:39:42.495 --> 00:39:44.355
I promise I'm landing the plane.

00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:46.545
He says, for I'm already being poured out.

00:39:46.545 --> 00:39:47.174
It's a drink offer.

00:39:48.165 --> 00:39:50.205
And the time for my departure is close.

00:39:50.475 --> 00:39:51.584
I've fought the good fight.

00:39:51.584 --> 00:39:52.544
I've finished the race.

00:39:52.694 --> 00:39:57.435
I've kept the faith there is reserved
for me, the crown of righteousness,

00:39:57.524 --> 00:40:00.314
which the Lord, the righteous
judge will give me on that day.

00:40:00.319 --> 00:40:03.915
And not only me, but to all those
who have loved his appearing.

00:40:04.154 --> 00:40:06.855
Let me just kind of break these down
verse by verse pretty quickly here.

00:40:07.064 --> 00:40:13.064
Number one, basically in verse six,
Paul saying this from Philippians 1

00:40:13.064 --> 00:40:15.705
21 to live his Christ and to die his.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.230
It makes confusing sense
to you as it is to me.

00:40:19.234 --> 00:40:19.740
At times.

00:40:20.009 --> 00:40:22.080
He says, I'm being poured
out as a drink offering.

00:40:22.379 --> 00:40:25.140
You'd have to go to Old Testament
times to understand the idea behind

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.649
the purpose of a drink offering to
the Lord and a sacrifice of that.

00:40:28.649 --> 00:40:30.645
But basically what Paul's
saying is I poured out my life

00:40:31.259 --> 00:40:32.939
for the sake of the gospel.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:36.419
He lived in a such a way, and he
preached in such a way that he

00:40:36.419 --> 00:40:39.899
poured out his life for the sake
of others, for the sake of others.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.080
Then he goes on from there in verse seven.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.140
He says basically that he fought
the fight, right, the good fight.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.480
He fought to fulfill his ministry.

00:40:48.485 --> 00:40:51.060
I'll just tell you this, in order
to fulfill your ministry, it

00:40:51.065 --> 00:40:54.510
will not happen outta nowhere.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.250
You will have to fight for it.

00:40:56.924 --> 00:40:58.785
You will have to stretch yourself.

00:40:58.785 --> 00:41:01.964
You'll have to say yes to things you
never thought you would ever say yes to.

00:41:02.115 --> 00:41:04.274
I I, I, I was, again, I was sharing
this with Megan just a little bit ago.

00:41:04.605 --> 00:41:06.944
Whenever I started to ministry,
I didn't really know what God was

00:41:06.944 --> 00:41:10.365
calling me to other than I just wanted
to do whatever it was for the Lord.

00:41:11.085 --> 00:41:14.895
And you know what I told my pastor, if
you ask me to do anything, I'll do it.

00:41:15.674 --> 00:41:16.154
I'll do it.

00:41:16.605 --> 00:41:22.365
And the reason why I didn't want
the excuse of that, I had a choice.

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:26.444
because when I had a choice, my flesh
would say, Nope, that's too much.

00:41:27.015 --> 00:41:29.745
And I'm just telling you the reason
why I'm preaching today is because

00:41:29.745 --> 00:41:32.444
my pastor, two weeks later, after
a sermon ministry put me up on

00:41:32.444 --> 00:41:33.915
the stage, scared me to death.

00:41:34.154 --> 00:41:36.585
I preached one of the worst sermons
I've ever preached and he didn't put

00:41:36.585 --> 00:41:37.875
me back up there for three years.

00:41:38.025 --> 00:41:38.895
But you know what he did?

00:41:39.645 --> 00:41:41.835
I'm just telling you that's how bad I
was and I'm probably still working on it.

00:41:41.835 --> 00:41:42.045
Right.

00:41:42.555 --> 00:41:43.154
For three years.

00:41:43.154 --> 00:41:43.605
You know what he did?

00:41:43.605 --> 00:41:45.585
He didn't just say, Hey, you're
gonna sit on the sidelines.

00:41:46.335 --> 00:41:48.615
He let me preach on Sunday nights
cause it's a smaller crowd and more

00:41:48.615 --> 00:41:50.055
people that would just forgive.

00:41:51.029 --> 00:41:54.375
. Um, then he gave me like a, a Wednesday
night group again, another group

00:41:54.375 --> 00:41:57.345
of people that I kind of just cut
my teeth on learning how to teach.

00:41:57.555 --> 00:42:00.675
And then I taught small groups
and, and what ended up happening

00:42:00.675 --> 00:42:03.495
was I just put myself out there
in order to fulfill the ministry

00:42:03.495 --> 00:42:05.055
that God had called me to fulfill.

00:42:05.175 --> 00:42:06.255
I had to fight for it.

00:42:06.555 --> 00:42:09.015
I had to fight against
the flesh of saying no.

00:42:09.345 --> 00:42:12.765
So when somebody asked you to
do something, say, You won't

00:42:12.765 --> 00:42:13.785
regret it cuz God has to show.

00:42:13.785 --> 00:42:16.695
I always tell people this when I said
yes in those moments I would always

00:42:16.695 --> 00:42:20.025
say, God, you're going to show up cuz
I'm not going to like, I'm just not.

00:42:20.235 --> 00:42:22.245
And he would because that's who God is.

00:42:22.995 --> 00:42:26.145
So again, Paul was an example of that.

00:42:26.145 --> 00:42:27.945
He didn't throw in the
towel when it got tough.

00:42:28.005 --> 00:42:29.715
He kept the faith.

00:42:29.925 --> 00:42:34.245
And I love this faith is seeing what
God sees even though we don't see it.

00:42:34.735 --> 00:42:35.595
I want you to think about this.

00:42:35.595 --> 00:42:40.635
Paul spent most of his time
in prison getting persecuted.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.870
He was sowing the seat of the
gospel many times and he had no

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.819
clue what the return would be.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.980
He had no clue what the return would be.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.450
I even think about this.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:56.220
Paul wrote most of the New Testament,
and I don't believe he understood fully

00:42:56.279 --> 00:43:00.299
that that word would be here today and
that millions and probably billions of

00:43:00.305 --> 00:43:02.910
lives have been changed by his letters.

00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:08.609
But you know what I do know
whenever I see Paul is he kept

00:43:08.615 --> 00:43:10.589
the faith, which means this.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.879
In writing and pinning those letters, and
by sharing the gospel and being a model

00:43:14.879 --> 00:43:20.430
for Christ, he in faith experienced this.

00:43:21.089 --> 00:43:23.670
He knew what he was doing
was going to transform lives.

00:43:23.879 --> 00:43:28.379
I'm telling you at times you need to
know that faith is sometimes the only

00:43:28.379 --> 00:43:31.830
thing that will hold you together
because you believe God sees the

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:33.420
result of your faithfulness in the.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.430
And if you can see what God sees, oh
man, you'll start celebrating now and

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:41.160
then one day you'll be me sitting up
here preaching to a group of people

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.890
when I was in my home wondering, is
anybody gonna show up to this church?

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.350
Okay, it can happen.

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:51.990
I've seen my brother-in-law give us
life to Christ in a car after a G,

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.840
after we went to the gym when I'd
shared the gospel with him many times

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.690
before and I didn't ever think he
was gonna give his life to Christ.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:00.090
And I just happened to present the gospel
one day after the gym and he's like,

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.040
yeah, there's nothing that would ever
stop me from giving my life to Christ.

00:44:02.045 --> 00:44:02.700
And I'm like, what'd you?

00:44:03.915 --> 00:44:07.935
I'm telling you, faith is so important.

00:44:08.265 --> 00:44:09.525
Paul's faithfulness.

00:44:09.585 --> 00:44:11.715
He had fought the fight, right?

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:12.795
He had finished the race.

00:44:12.795 --> 00:44:13.815
He'd kept the faith.

00:44:14.115 --> 00:44:15.525
Oh, I'm gonna encourage you.

00:44:15.855 --> 00:44:19.425
We need to look at Paul's example
of fulfill in his ministry and

00:44:19.425 --> 00:44:21.135
see that we have a hope in ours.

00:44:23.595 --> 00:44:25.935
I think that we need to take Paul's.

00:44:27.605 --> 00:44:29.145
and I think we need to see it as well.

00:44:29.265 --> 00:44:33.765
I believe God is going to transform the
city, this church, your life and my life

00:44:34.375 --> 00:44:37.575
for the sake of the gospel, for the good
of our lives, to experience God's best

00:44:37.694 --> 00:44:41.145
to to see so many people be changed.

00:44:41.895 --> 00:44:46.095
And you may struggle to see it now,
but I pray as you seek the word of

00:44:46.095 --> 00:44:51.825
God, as you fill your ministry, that
you begin to see it now and celebrate

00:44:51.825 --> 00:44:56.670
now, and then one day look back and
go, Aw man, God is, God is good.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:58.710
And he says this, this is what I love.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.650
He says there at the end of my
life, again, at the end of Paul's

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.580
life, he knew it reserved for him
was the crown of righteousness

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:06.480
that the Lord would give him.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:10.590
Paul fulfilled the goal that he had in
Philippians three 14 where he says, I've

00:45:10.595 --> 00:45:15.630
pursued as my goal the prize promised
by God's heavenly call in Christ Jesus.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.380
And I think the cool part here
is that Paul says the last

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.700
statement, don't miss this.

00:45:21.779 --> 00:45:23.250
And only not only.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:27.540
But to all those who loved disappearing,
let me just translate that for you.

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:31.171
To all those who have preached the
word and fulfilled their ministry will

00:45:31.176 --> 00:45:34.350
experience the same thing, the crown of
righteousness at the end of their life.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:38.820
Ah, man, if that's not a call to
surrender, if that's not a call to

00:45:38.825 --> 00:45:42.090
surrender your life to Jesus, if that's
not a call to surrender, to preaching,

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:45.420
being a herald of whatever of the word of
God that you have to those surrounding,

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.630
if that is not a call to fulfill
your ministry, I don't know what is.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:50.070
I don't know what is.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.810
I am excited.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:55.320
About what God has allowed
each one of us to be a part of.

00:45:55.950 --> 00:46:00.570
I'm a small part of this, but all
of us are the body of Christ working

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:04.110
together to fulfill the ministry that
God's called this church to fulfill.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.010
I love it.

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:05.760
Isn't that cool?

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.720
I love it.

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:09.600
So we're gonna head into a
time of invitation and I, I

00:46:09.605 --> 00:46:12.360
communicate over and over again
what is the purpose of invitation.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.400
It's a time to reflect.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:20.070
It's a time to say, Hey God, I need
to take whatever you have taught me.

00:46:21.134 --> 00:46:22.455
And I need to accept it.

00:46:23.235 --> 00:46:27.645
I, I, I need some time to, to ask God
and say, Hey God, how do I, how do I get

00:46:27.645 --> 00:46:29.865
the confidence to preach the word God?

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:30.165
How?

00:46:30.165 --> 00:46:31.965
How do I fulfill my ministry?

00:46:31.965 --> 00:46:33.705
This is the time to seek the Lord.

00:46:34.515 --> 00:46:37.605
And I wanna make this statement
because I think it's such a challenge.

00:46:37.995 --> 00:46:41.805
You may see the ability to
preach the word or to fulfill

00:46:41.805 --> 00:46:44.924
your ministry is so far away.

00:46:44.924 --> 00:46:46.695
You don't even know how to experience it.

00:46:47.654 --> 00:46:48.735
Small steps.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.590
Done consistently over time
or produce big results.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:58.860
Don't leave today before you
commit to taking one small step.

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:03.600
One small step, then my challenge
for you is to tell somebody.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:09.810
I'll just tell you this, I probably
fulfilled zero of zero of the things

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.470
that I've committed to that I've never
told anybody about because when I'm

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:16.960
not accountable, nobody knows that I.

00:47:18.345 --> 00:47:21.314
But my challenge for you to tell
somebody, what is God calling you to do?

00:47:21.944 --> 00:47:23.745
Is he calling you to
give your life to Jesus?

00:47:24.104 --> 00:47:29.115
And if he is, then today, commit
to repenting of your sins, turning

00:47:29.115 --> 00:47:30.944
to the Lord and saying, yes, Jesus.

00:47:31.694 --> 00:47:33.345
I want to experience
God's best of my life.

00:47:35.205 --> 00:47:37.544
I don't know what it
is you do and God does.

00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:42.314
So commit to today during invitation
number two, tell someone, okay.

00:47:43.049 --> 00:47:49.529
Number three, if there's anything
that I can do to help you fulfill

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:53.609
the calling in your life, I want
to help you and not only me.

00:47:53.615 --> 00:47:54.240
Here's the cool part.

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.609
We have a lot of people in this
church that want to come alongside

00:47:56.609 --> 00:47:58.379
you cuz this is not just my church.

00:47:58.379 --> 00:47:59.220
This is our church.

00:48:00.629 --> 00:48:06.060
I love serving alongside each one
of you, and I have loved seeing so

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.720
many of you fulfill your ministry.

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:09.120
There are some of you.

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:14.000
To have another step to take
to fulfill your ministry.

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.350
May God use you.

00:48:16.355 --> 00:48:20.490
May God use us as a church to do great
mighty things because of what he's

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:25.380
done for us on the cross and what he
has done today by using his word to

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:30.000
convict, to correct and to encourage.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:31.529
Let's pray.

00:48:31.529 --> 00:48:34.710
Lord Jesus, you are God and we are not.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:40.605
And Lord, if I know anybody in this,
Maybe they're a lot like me, Lord.

00:48:40.605 --> 00:48:45.315
I hear the message today and
I'm probably scared, Lord.

00:48:45.315 --> 00:48:48.255
I hear the message today and, and
honestly, Lord, there's days where

00:48:48.255 --> 00:48:51.165
I hear messages like this today
and I don't even know what to do.

00:48:52.245 --> 00:48:57.405
Lord may today, during invitation, you
bring clarity to those who don't know

00:48:57.645 --> 00:49:02.655
the next step they need to take in
order to, to proclaim the word or to

00:49:02.655 --> 00:49:04.855
fulfill their ministry or to accept.

00:49:06.689 --> 00:49:10.589
God, I pray for those who may be scared
or nervous about what it means to

00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:12.240
fulfill the ministry in their lives.

00:49:13.529 --> 00:49:16.980
Lord, may they remember your word
again, that you have not given them

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:23.549
a spirit of fear, but a spirit of
power and of love and of sound.

00:49:23.549 --> 00:49:26.240
Mind God, I pray for those in this.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:30.300
That are looking for encouragement.

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.580
God, may they get it from your word.

00:49:32.585 --> 00:49:35.370
May they get it from your
people here in this church.

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:40.200
Lord, may they get it from me, Lord,
that they can do exceedingly, abundantly,

00:49:40.205 --> 00:49:42.000
more than you can ask or think.

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:45.300
Lord, you are God.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:50.070
And because we believe this,
we are here today to meet you.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.410
And Lord, I pray that
we have met you through.

00:49:53.745 --> 00:49:57.315
So, Lord, during this time of invitation,
Lord, I pray that if anybody does not know

00:49:57.315 --> 00:49:59.715
you, the Lord today, they will stand up.

00:49:59.715 --> 00:50:01.545
They will go find me in the
back and they will say, today,

00:50:01.545 --> 00:50:02.745
I need to give my life to Jesus.

00:50:03.285 --> 00:50:05.925
Lord, I pray if there's someone in
this room that needs to surrender to

00:50:06.375 --> 00:50:10.905
ministry, they wanna proclaim that
to the rooftops, Lord, I pray that

00:50:10.905 --> 00:50:14.745
they come find me, and today they
can publicly commit to that ministry.

00:50:15.195 --> 00:50:16.635
Lord, I just prayed that if just.

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:21.000
Someone is just wanting to take that
next step, Lord, that you meet them

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.850
where they are and that you bring
friends around them to help them do that.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:28.290
Lord, may you be glorified in all that
we commit to in this time of invitation.

00:50:28.589 --> 00:50:30.480
We pray this in your heavenly name, Jesus.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:31.730
Amen.

00:50:32.009 --> 00:50:32.279
Amen.

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:33.180
Let's take some time.
