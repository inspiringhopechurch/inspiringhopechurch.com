00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.460
Well, I am really
excited about being here.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.400
I'm just thrilled.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.100
That Ben would ask me to come down and,
and share a little bit with you today.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.330
I don't get to share too much.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.519
I, I'm a kind of re old retired guy, and
so I don't get too many opportunities,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.230
uh, just to be able to share the word.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.010
So I, I'm really excited and I,
I really am happy to be here.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.590
Uh, I, I love your, your church.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.260
I've seen you online, but
I've never seen you live.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.080
Uh, and so I, you know, I've
checked out the building and,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.420
and I looked at your website and.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.960
I'm not sure.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.080
Are you the gal who was
baptized on, on the website?

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.230
That's you.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.650
Okay.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.500
It is a wonderful picture.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.760
I mean, you're so smiling.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.750
It's like that is what every baptism
should look like, you know, it's just, you

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.651
can just tell you're just so excited about
coming up into new life and all that.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.120
It's absolutely great.

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:18.950
I, I love the name Inspiring.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.670
Is, is, is a great, is just a
great adjective to go with hope.

00:01:23.565 --> 00:01:28.375
And I did a study in hope, not, not
just for this, but I've done a study on

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:33.155
the word hope before in the Bible, and
it's different than the way I use hope.

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:35.414
Hope, ah, I hope the
Buckeyes continue to win.

00:01:35.414 --> 00:01:37.524
I hope, I hope it doesn't rain next week.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:42.664
If you look at the biblical term of hope
and kind of do a word study on that,

00:01:43.214 --> 00:01:49.009
it is almost, All the time connected to
the promises of God, and usually it's

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.020
connected to the resurrection of Jesus
Christ and the hope that we have in him.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.289
So my definition of biblical hope is 100
percent confidence in the promises of God.

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:05.325
I don't always have that hope.

00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:09.355
And in fact, oftentimes I live in
the hope of I hope it doesn't rain.

00:02:09.645 --> 00:02:13.105
I gotta tell you a real quick story
about one of those times for me.

00:02:13.325 --> 00:02:17.244
It was on July 17th, 2014.

00:02:17.245 --> 00:02:22.465
And I was living at the time
in a one room above a bar.

00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:27.280
And the reason I was living in that
one room above the bar In a little

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.390
place called Port Clinton, Pennsylvania
is because I was trying to through

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.900
hike the Appalachian Trail, and
that's 1200 miles into the trail.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.400
I fell down, hurt my leg, got
cellulitis in my leg, and so I'm

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.600
kind of just Hung up here in this
little town and my leg was so sore.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.260
I lived in a one little room and
you had to go down the, the, uh, the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.190
hallway to get to the bathroom, and I
could hardly get down to the bathroom.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.460
My leg hurt so much, it was
just thumping and it was red.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.640
And, uh, so I, I went to the,
uh, uh, urgent care and they

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.720
gave me some antibiotics.

00:03:01.725 --> 00:03:05.350
So I'm pumping these antibiotics and
it's doing almost nothing for me.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.280
And I'm thinking, I think my hike's over.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.340
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to continue.

00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:16.135
And I wanted to finish the Appalachian
Trail so much it was just a driving

00:03:16.135 --> 00:03:19.225
force in my life for a couple of
years to try to get this done.

00:03:19.374 --> 00:03:22.624
I think, I don't, I'm not sure
I'm going to be able to continue.

00:03:23.024 --> 00:03:26.444
So I called my wife and I
said, Kat, I think I'm done.

00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:29.304
I think I'm going to have to get
a rental car and just come home.

00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:32.660
And she said, Are you
taking your antibiotics?

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.860
Yeah, I'm taking my antibiotics,
and it's not doing any good.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.269
He said, are you taking ibuprofen?

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.850
I said, no, I'm taking antibiotics.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.920
He said, well, you can take ibuprofen
and antibiotics at the same time.

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.259
I didn't know that.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.360
So I started to take a little bit
of ibuprofen, and I thought, the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.389
next day, this is my decision day.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.929
I'm either going to
continue, or I'm going home.

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:54.229
And I I want to continue,
but I don't know that I can.

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:59.480
So I packed up my back one out of the, uh,
of Port Clinton, and you got to climb up

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.519
this mountain to get out of Port Clinton.

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.700
If I can get to the top of the
mountain, I think I'm going to be okay.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.640
If I can't get to the top of the
mountain, I just got to come down and

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.220
I got I got to get my my rental car.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.160
So I made it to the top of the mountain.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.089
Two and a half months later, I'm
standing on Mount Katahdin in Maine.

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:18.419
But I had this decision.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.870
I hope that I can do this,
but I don't know that I can.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.620
I just don't know if I can continue.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.120
Well, Paul writes this letter
to, uh, the church at Colossae.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.390
And in chapter 2, he kind of brings
them to that kind of a place.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.500
Do you gonna continue?

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:36.180
Do you wanna continue?

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.010
Do you need to continue?

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.280
How are you gonna continue?

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.430
And so it's here in, uh,
Colossians chapter 2, verse 6 to 8.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.460
And I'd like to just look
at this passage and maybe...

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:50.679
Yeah, there we go.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.560
Uh, just kind of read this passage,
and then I want to dig into it just a

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.840
little bit and see what this might say
and how that we can continue as well.

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.059
It says, So then, just as you received
Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:09.680
in Him, rooted and built up in Him,
strengthened in your faith as you were

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:11.580
taught, and overflowing with faith.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.800
With thankfulness.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.380
See to it that no one takes you
captive through hollow and deceptive

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.799
philosophy, which depends on human
tradition and the basic principles

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.630
of this world rather than on Christ.

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:28.989
So I'd like to zero in, first of all, in
verses 6 and 7, and you can kind of see

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.440
the, uh, the place where I want to start.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.370
Continue to live in Him.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.159
Now this word for live
is an interesting word.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.120
In the Greek, it actually means to walk.

00:05:43.595 --> 00:05:44.815
You know, I like that.

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:49.555
And oftentimes it means to walk with a
purpose or walk with with with integrity.

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:52.235
And it's kind of like the old saying,
you know, you got to talk to talk,

00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:53.654
but you need to walk the walk.

00:05:53.715 --> 00:05:58.924
That's a biblical idea of what it
means to live in him, to walk in.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.170
A content, uh, driven life.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.310
I like the word hike here
obviously, 'cause I'm a hiker,

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.530
but I like the word hike because
hike has for me a context of life.

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.659
You know, when I go for a walk, I
go down a nice little paved road and

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:17.840
everything's really nice and stuff,
but when you go for a hike, man, you go

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.770
up and you go down and you go through
the, the, the forest and you go through

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.960
the water and, and it rains on you.

00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:26.120
And, and, and that's
more like life, isn't it?

00:06:26.565 --> 00:06:30.054
It's not just a nice little
smooth little paved sidewalk.

00:06:30.474 --> 00:06:32.185
Life is hard sometimes.

00:06:33.054 --> 00:06:35.944
There's a song written by
Stephen Curtis Chapman.

00:06:36.444 --> 00:06:40.914
Uh, I memorized this song before I
went on my hike because it's so cool.

00:06:40.914 --> 00:06:42.405
It's called A Long Way Home.

00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:45.965
It says, I started out on
this great adventure when my

00:06:45.965 --> 00:06:47.525
father started leading me home.

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:49.395
He said, there's gonna be some
mountains to climb and some

00:06:49.395 --> 00:06:50.635
valleys we're gonna go through.

00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:55.385
But I had no way of knowing how
hard that journey was gonna be.

00:06:55.975 --> 00:06:58.725
Because the valleys are deeper
and the mountains are steeper

00:06:58.915 --> 00:07:00.135
than I ever could have dreamed.

00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:02.045
But I know we're gonna make it.

00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:03.895
I know we're gonna make it soon.

00:07:04.225 --> 00:07:06.865
I know sometimes it feels like
you're going the wrong way.

00:07:07.564 --> 00:07:09.844
But it's just a long way home.

00:07:10.034 --> 00:07:15.884
I like that concept because we need
to continue to hike, continue to live.

00:07:16.124 --> 00:07:20.014
And this word can, uh, of live, it
really is just the verb to live,

00:07:20.194 --> 00:07:21.204
but it's in the present tense.

00:07:21.214 --> 00:07:27.884
So you have this continual hiking, this
continual living, constantly hiking.

00:07:28.774 --> 00:07:34.820
So As I was laying in this bed in
Port Clinton, I thought, how in

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.510
the world am I going to do that?

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.410
And I think that's kind of the
question we need to ask here.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.749
Okay, I want to continue to live in him.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.539
How do I do that?

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.350
How do I make that through when it's
pouring down the rain and I'm really

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:49.150
cold and I gotta go up this mountain?

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.370
How do I do that?

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.950
Well, I think Paul gives seven
footprints, if you will, as to how

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.320
we can continue to live in him.

00:07:59.865 --> 00:08:03.395
And the first one, it goes backwards
just a little bit, just as you receive

00:08:03.415 --> 00:08:05.675
Christ Jesus as Lord, continue.

00:08:05.895 --> 00:08:08.895
So we have to remember, you
know, we have to remember that

00:08:08.895 --> 00:08:10.874
time when we came to the Lord.

00:08:10.965 --> 00:08:16.355
For me, that was 50 years ago, long
before most of you were even born.

00:08:18.144 --> 00:08:21.935
For some of you, it may be five years
ago, it might be five days ago, it

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:23.205
might not have even happened yet.

00:08:23.895 --> 00:08:28.175
But for those of you who know the
Lord, Paul is calling us to think back.

00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:33.695
To the way that we found Christ, the
way that we we we accepted him and

00:08:33.705 --> 00:08:35.804
just that way we need to continue.

00:08:36.174 --> 00:08:39.564
And when I think about how I came to
the Lord, there were some realizations

00:08:39.564 --> 00:08:41.354
that took place in my life.

00:08:41.434 --> 00:08:43.105
There was a realization of who God is.

00:08:43.495 --> 00:08:47.965
God is so big and he is so perfect
and he's holy and he's powerful

00:08:48.155 --> 00:08:53.805
and he's love and he's just just
truth transcendent so far above me.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.220
I had to recognize who God was in my life,
and then I need to recognize who I was.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:04.340
I was not God, I'm not holy, I'm broken,
I was messed up, I was a sinful person.

00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:09.110
So I need to recognize this
gulf between God and myself.

00:09:10.045 --> 00:09:13.865
Realizing that I can't get past that gulf.

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:18.185
Just to kind of give you a quick
illustration, if you think that gulf is

00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:23.274
like a mile, just a mile, not, not 2, 186
miles of the Appalachian Trail, just one

00:09:23.275 --> 00:09:29.665
mile, if we're one mile away from God, and
if we could just somehow jump that far, I

00:09:29.665 --> 00:09:37.090
happen to look at the, the world's record
for the longest, Running broad jump 1968.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.490
If you can believe that's when
it was set by Bob Breenham.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.320
I actually saw that Olympic game.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.955
He ran and he jumped 29 ft 2.

00:09:45.955 --> 00:09:51.000
5 inches of the 5, 280
ft that we need to jump.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.430
It's just impossible no matter who
you are to really make it to God.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.300
So it's that recognition.

00:09:57.685 --> 00:10:01.155
Of, uh, off the golf.

00:10:01.505 --> 00:10:04.775
And then there's the recognition
of Jesus and what Jesus did.

00:10:04.985 --> 00:10:07.375
Jesus was God and became man.

00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:08.995
We couldn't make it over to God.

00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:12.375
So God came to us and he
just didn't come to teach.

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:13.764
He came to die for us.

00:10:14.215 --> 00:10:15.805
He is the gap filler.

00:10:15.904 --> 00:10:16.745
He's the bridge.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.340
It's through his blood that
we have forgiveness of sin.

00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:22.400
He is our savior and our redeemer.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.210
So you have to have to kind
of get that as well in mind.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:31.189
And then, and then this verse says
not only do we need to receive Christ

00:10:31.199 --> 00:10:33.000
Jesus, because here's the Christ part.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.620
Here is the savior part.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.660
Here's the Messiah.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.840
Here's the anointed one.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:44.790
He's the one who redeems us from our sin,
but as Lord, receiving Christ as Lord.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.719
He's the master.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:47.930
We are not.

00:10:48.885 --> 00:10:50.314
He's the one who's in control.

00:10:51.004 --> 00:10:51.634
We are not.

00:10:51.785 --> 00:10:52.754
Talk about control.

00:10:53.545 --> 00:10:54.615
Don't have that control, do we?

00:10:55.025 --> 00:10:57.804
God, though, is the master
and the one in control.

00:10:57.895 --> 00:11:02.775
So when you think about all of the
attitude that that is in receiving

00:11:02.775 --> 00:11:07.914
Christ as your Savior and your Lord,
you have these attitudes of humility.

00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:09.515
Can't make it.

00:11:09.615 --> 00:11:10.425
I can't do this.

00:11:10.635 --> 00:11:14.135
It's only through Christ this attitude
of repentance I need to turn from

00:11:14.135 --> 00:11:18.055
my sin and and take the bridge
that that Christ is offering and

00:11:18.055 --> 00:11:20.454
then just that Incredible attitude.

00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:24.054
So if we have a gratitude, so if we have
that kind of attitude I think that's

00:11:24.055 --> 00:11:29.885
our first step to continuing need to
understand who Christ is in in living

00:11:29.885 --> 00:11:35.375
for him So footstep number two, two,
three and four are great picture words

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:37.564
And the first word here is rooted.

00:11:37.574 --> 00:11:39.275
This is the picture of the tree.

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:46.484
We are a tree with those roots
that go down way, way deep in life.

00:11:46.964 --> 00:11:52.575
In fact, this This Greek tense verb
tense, but I hope this isn't too

00:11:52.575 --> 00:11:53.735
much down in the weeds for you.

00:11:53.735 --> 00:11:58.115
But this, the Greek has several tenses
just like we do in English and they have

00:11:58.115 --> 00:12:01.445
what they call the perfect tense and we
don't have a perfect tense in English.

00:12:01.445 --> 00:12:04.455
In fact, we have very little perfect
at all in the English language.

00:12:04.455 --> 00:12:06.905
It's one of the most confusing
languages I've ever seen.

00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:10.455
But in the Greek, there is this
perfect tense and the perfect

00:12:10.485 --> 00:12:13.385
tense is a combination of the
past tense and the present tense.

00:12:13.655 --> 00:12:14.685
And what it means is.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.800
Something happened in the past,
and what happened in the past

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.710
is still at work in the present.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.940
And so he's saying, we were
rooted, we were rooted when

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.190
we accepted Christ as Lord.

00:12:27.339 --> 00:12:30.270
That's when the roots started to go
down, and those roots are, they haven't

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.099
gone away, those roots are still here.

00:12:33.199 --> 00:12:37.200
We need to continue to be that
tree, putting down our roots as

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.110
far as we can, down into the soil.

00:12:40.895 --> 00:12:41.605
I love trees.

00:12:41.605 --> 00:12:45.655
I don't hug them, but I do love
trees, and I like to see how beautiful

00:12:45.655 --> 00:12:48.665
they are in the forest, and one of
the things I noticed about trees,

00:12:48.665 --> 00:12:49.715
you can't even see the roots.

00:12:49.885 --> 00:12:52.275
I mean, the roots are underneath of
it, and that's what makes the tree

00:12:52.275 --> 00:12:56.094
strong and powerful, and that's
oftentimes true in our lives.

00:12:56.094 --> 00:13:00.064
Sometimes we don't see, uh, people
don't see what makes us strong, but our

00:13:00.145 --> 00:13:02.505
roots are way down there in the dirt.

00:13:03.865 --> 00:13:08.965
And for us, it's down deep into
Jesus tree goes roots goes go

00:13:08.975 --> 00:13:11.045
down into the dirt to get water.

00:13:11.185 --> 00:13:12.675
And Jesus said, I'm the living water.

00:13:13.055 --> 00:13:14.565
People can drink and get thirsty.

00:13:14.565 --> 00:13:17.105
But if you drink my water,
you'll never go thirsty.

00:13:17.445 --> 00:13:20.784
And the roots go down and get all those
nutrients as well out of the ground.

00:13:20.924 --> 00:13:22.035
Jesus said, I'm the bread of life.

00:13:23.194 --> 00:13:25.845
If you eat my bread, you'll
never go hungry again.

00:13:26.145 --> 00:13:30.555
And so it's that first thing is that
just being grew being rooted way

00:13:30.555 --> 00:13:33.385
down deep into what who Christ is.

00:13:33.385 --> 00:13:34.954
That's how we can continue.

00:13:34.995 --> 00:13:39.474
We continue to live in him as we
get those roots way down in there.

00:13:40.635 --> 00:13:44.294
The third one is to be built up
and he kind of changes perspectives

00:13:44.294 --> 00:13:45.914
here from a tree to a house.

00:13:46.324 --> 00:13:49.584
Now, trees send their roots down.

00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:52.314
A house is built up.

00:13:53.305 --> 00:13:55.495
This is what is seen in life.

00:13:55.775 --> 00:13:58.655
Okay, the roots are way down,
and that's the foundation.

00:13:58.665 --> 00:14:01.635
And we kind of, he's kind of mixing
metaphors here, but, but that, the

00:14:01.635 --> 00:14:08.510
roots are the foundation, and we begin
to build up, um, in, in the, uh, In

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:12.370
the construction phase, and we are
currently this is a present tense.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.609
We are under construction.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.750
We're being built.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.579
This is a passive verb.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.620
God builds us up as we walk in him.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.950
God is the one who builds us up.

00:14:22.099 --> 00:14:25.529
He builds us up with knowledge
of the things that we should

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.310
know the truth that's there.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:31.320
He builds us up in obedience,
giving us many opportunities to

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.510
serve him and to be obedient to
him and God as we as we make it.

00:14:35.865 --> 00:14:40.055
The most of those opportunities
we could build up in him.

00:14:41.135 --> 00:14:47.614
The third picture word, the fourth step,
is being strengthened in the faith.

00:14:48.324 --> 00:14:51.064
And this word for strengthened
means to be established.

00:14:51.124 --> 00:14:52.334
It means to be firm.

00:14:52.474 --> 00:14:53.624
It means to be a rock.

00:14:53.734 --> 00:14:55.364
It means to be unwavering.

00:14:56.865 --> 00:15:01.810
And when I thought about this picture
word, several Words came to my mind.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:02.730
Thoughts came to my mind.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:03.710
The first was Jell O.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:11.110
I, I, I was a, I was a kid in the
60s, in the 70s, and Jell O, I'm

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:15.089
not sure if it was first invented
then or not, but I just thought Jell

00:15:15.089 --> 00:15:16.629
O was the best thing in the world.

00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:20.610
I mean, it was like I Water and
you know, my mom just mixed up

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.390
some stuff and it was just watery.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.870
Put it in the refrigerator
and the next day she could

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.470
turn it over and it was firm.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:27.080
It was blue, blue.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.300
It was great.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.030
I love the taste.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.549
You could cut it with a
fork, but it was solid.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:32.800
I thought, man, that's cool.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.630
That's a great picture.

00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:35.570
But I thought, no, you know, you could.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.410
You can take that with a spoon
and you can throw it if you want.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.450
You can do all kinds of stuff.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.500
It's not really this strengthening.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.120
So I thought about concrete.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.390
That's a good example.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.560
Concrete, especially quickcrete.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.360
I don't know if you've ever worked with
quickcrete, but you better know exactly

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.870
where you're going to put that quickcrete,
like right away, or it's going to be

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.490
a rock in your bucket really fast.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.760
I thought, that's a great example.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.900
Then I thought, no, you know, in our
neighborhood right now, they're putting in

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:09.440
a, uh, A new, uh, gas line, and so they're
going up and they're ripping up, uh, some

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.130
of the sidewalks and you have, you just
have this little, uh, backhoe comes and

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:17.539
just rips it up and then the concrete
just smashes and all that kind of stuff.

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:19.700
And that's not a very
good picture in some way.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.609
So this is my best picture of
what I think Paul is trying to

00:16:23.609 --> 00:16:26.930
tell us, uh, and that is epoxy.

00:16:27.235 --> 00:16:27.945
Wood glue.

00:16:28.805 --> 00:16:33.655
Now again, I'm a little kid and my dad
is an engineer, but my dad is really

00:16:33.745 --> 00:16:37.435
a carpenter at heart He used to go
down in the basement to make sawdust.

00:16:37.435 --> 00:16:41.305
That's what he said And so he was
always making something in the basement.

00:16:41.305 --> 00:16:43.185
So one day I was down I
said hey dad, how you doing?

00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:45.134
So all Dave come over here.

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:51.710
I got to show you I just got this new
epoxy wood glue And he, he said, I'm gonna

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.630
put all these pieces of wood together
and he had, he had cherry and he had teak

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.130
and he had walnut and he had all these
different kind of scraps of wood and

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:04.190
he says, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, uh, glue
these all together and then I'm just gonna

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:10.020
cut a slice away and I'm gonna put some,
um, polyurethane on top and the grain is

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:14.380
gonna come out and the color is gonna,
this is gonna be a beautiful artwork.

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:15.530
I said, man, that's great.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.869
And he said, and this is the best thing.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.000
If somebody drops Yeah.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.010
Yeah.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:20.019
Yeah.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:26.010
This artwork or if somebody even tries
to break this artwork, the wood is

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.800
going to break before the glue does.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.760
The glue is so much stronger
than the wood itself.

00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:34.799
That's the picture that I think
Paul is trying to say to us.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.189
We need to be like epoxy wood glue.

00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:39.179
Gorilla wood glue wasn't

00:17:43.045 --> 00:17:45.845
I don't know if you can see that
picture, but it is being so strong

00:17:45.915 --> 00:17:50.495
that no matter what happens in life, no
matter who might break, no matter what

00:17:50.495 --> 00:17:54.584
situation might fall, no matter whether
COVID goes for another 10 years, oh,

00:17:54.975 --> 00:18:00.705
but you know, no matter what happens,
we can be absolutely firm and solid,

00:18:00.965 --> 00:18:04.085
just like a rock, just like wood glue.

00:18:05.475 --> 00:18:07.014
Strengthened in your face.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:10.490
Footstep number five.

00:18:12.255 --> 00:18:15.435
Continue to live in
him as you were taught.

00:18:15.575 --> 00:18:18.625
And I thought, well, who
taught the church at Colossae?

00:18:19.285 --> 00:18:21.435
Uh, my first thought was Paul,
and I thought, no, you know what?

00:18:21.615 --> 00:18:24.675
Paul never even visited
the church at Colossae.

00:18:24.785 --> 00:18:29.834
There's a guy by the name of Epaphras, who
was a disciple of Paul, but Epaphras is

00:18:29.835 --> 00:18:32.175
the one who came to the church and taught.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:35.795
And I thought, if we could only
have Paul come and teach us.

00:18:35.795 --> 00:18:37.475
If, if we could only have Epaphras.

00:18:37.475 --> 00:18:38.785
So I thought, wait, wait a minute.

00:18:39.045 --> 00:18:39.895
We do have.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:44.720
We don't have just one letter
from Colossae from Paul.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.900
We have 27 books of the New Testament.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.020
We have 66 books of the entire Bible.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.520
We have all of that word to teach us.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:59.420
We also have the Holy Spirit, which
is a great passage in John 14 26 when

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.640
Jesus said, you know, when the Holy
Spirit comes, who the father is going to

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:09.870
send in my name, he will teach you all
things and everything that I've said.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.819
He'll bring that back to your memories.

00:19:12.239 --> 00:19:15.980
And I thought we have that same
Holy Spirit living in our lives.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:21.515
So as we read the word and as the Holy
Spirit illuminates that word for us, We

00:19:21.515 --> 00:19:24.055
can learn, we can continue to be taught.

00:19:24.754 --> 00:19:26.315
And then there are faithful men.

00:19:26.945 --> 00:19:27.875
Who teach us.

00:19:28.975 --> 00:19:34.745
I've met with your pastor, Ben,
for several months now, just

00:19:34.745 --> 00:19:37.814
kind of once a month, just to
talk, and he loves you guys.

00:19:37.975 --> 00:19:39.135
He loves this church.

00:19:39.274 --> 00:19:42.365
He is so passionate
about what's happening.

00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:44.185
He is loving the community.

00:19:44.185 --> 00:19:49.044
He is reaching out to that community
with this great fervor about himself.

00:19:49.084 --> 00:19:51.925
You have a great pastor in Ben.

00:19:52.135 --> 00:19:53.074
Encourage him.

00:19:53.694 --> 00:19:56.954
I know you're going to go out and give
gifts to other pastors this next week.

00:19:57.034 --> 00:19:58.225
I've never heard that before.

00:19:58.444 --> 00:20:00.094
I just think that's fantastic.

00:20:00.354 --> 00:20:02.904
For people from another church
to go to another church and

00:20:02.914 --> 00:20:04.284
give a gift to the pastor.

00:20:04.354 --> 00:20:06.124
I think that's absolutely fantastic.

00:20:06.374 --> 00:20:08.914
Make sure you love on your pastor too.

00:20:08.995 --> 00:20:10.604
Make sure you pay him well, okay?

00:20:11.024 --> 00:20:15.754
Just take care of him because
he's a faithful man that can teach

00:20:15.754 --> 00:20:17.914
you much about the Word of God.

00:20:18.505 --> 00:20:19.305
That's step five.

00:20:19.794 --> 00:20:20.865
Step number six.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:27.939
Continue to live in him as you were
taught and overflowing with thanksgiving.

00:20:28.604 --> 00:20:34.665
This word overflowing means an
abundance, means to excel, to exceed,

00:20:34.665 --> 00:20:36.645
excuse me, means to bubble over.

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:39.784
Yeah, when I, when I drink hot
chocolate, I notice some of the guys

00:20:39.794 --> 00:20:40.915
back there making hot chocolate.

00:20:41.024 --> 00:20:45.065
When I make my hot chocolate, I
make my hot chocolate right to

00:20:45.065 --> 00:20:49.365
the brim, because I want every bit
of hot chocolate that I can get.

00:20:49.605 --> 00:20:53.455
I had a friend, uh, we used to go
out to, uh, to Chipotle for, for

00:20:53.455 --> 00:20:56.885
lunch every once in a while, and
he'd get his, his, uh, soda glass.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.149
And he'd go over to the, to the
place and, and fill it up and,

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.170
and it was full to the brim.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.100
And then he'd go, and then he'd
fill it up just a little bit more.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.199
And, and, you know, that is
not even what this means.

00:21:08.379 --> 00:21:10.540
That means put your
soda glass under there.

00:21:10.619 --> 00:21:12.839
And when it gets to the top,
just let it continue to run.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.500
And it'll run clear over, go down
your hand, go into the little trough.

00:21:15.719 --> 00:21:16.469
That's what it means.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:17.860
It means bubbling over.

00:21:17.939 --> 00:21:20.639
It's completely past the brim.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.600
And I like the, the word leftover.

00:21:25.419 --> 00:21:26.969
Because basically it's saying.

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:29.220
We have enough left over.

00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:32.330
After a bubble's over, we
still have enough left over.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:36.650
This is the word that's used
after the feeding of the 5, 000.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:39.160
When everybody had their
full, they were all stuffed.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.100
They couldn't have any
more bread, no more fish.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:41.890
Man, we're just stuffed.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.119
There were 12 baskets left over.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:51.169
That's the kind of, that's the kind of
overwhelming Grace and thanksgiving.

00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.709
We have to have.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.419
I don't know if you can see this, this
picture, but I picked this picture.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.389
I've never really seen this one
before, but this is Jesus and his

00:21:57.389 --> 00:22:01.870
disciples coming out after the feeding
of the 5000 and each one of the 12

00:22:01.889 --> 00:22:03.669
described disciples has a basket.

00:22:03.719 --> 00:22:07.229
I don't think there was a mistake
that there were 12 baskets left over.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.390
Each one of them has their own
basket, a way of just remembering

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.300
what God did in such a miraculous way.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:20.950
And I think we need to have that same
kind of leftover thinking as we think

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.710
about what Jesus has done in our lives.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.630
We just need to be
overwhelming, overflowing with

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.600
thankfulness, with gratitude.

00:22:30.905 --> 00:22:33.125
What has God done for us in the rain?

00:22:33.465 --> 00:22:35.715
What has God done for
us down in the valley?

00:22:36.095 --> 00:22:37.865
What has God done for us on the mountain?

00:22:38.044 --> 00:22:42.564
All of those things, we should just
be overwhelmed with thankfulness.

00:22:42.774 --> 00:22:43.925
Is the situation good?

00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:44.394
No.

00:22:44.995 --> 00:22:46.485
Is the situation really difficult?

00:22:46.544 --> 00:22:47.184
Yeah.

00:22:47.564 --> 00:22:51.725
But how thankful we are for
what God has done in our lives.

00:22:53.534 --> 00:22:55.605
That's the first six steps.

00:22:55.845 --> 00:22:58.544
The seventh step is found in verse eight.

00:22:58.754 --> 00:23:01.165
And notice the change that Paul makes.

00:23:01.545 --> 00:23:02.605
In what's happening here.

00:23:02.795 --> 00:23:07.825
So see to it that no one takes you
captive through hollow and hollow and

00:23:07.825 --> 00:23:12.855
deceptive philosophy, which depends on
human tradition and the basic principles

00:23:12.865 --> 00:23:15.464
of this world rather than on Christ.

00:23:15.665 --> 00:23:16.375
Here it is.

00:23:17.185 --> 00:23:17.974
See to it.

00:23:18.204 --> 00:23:19.424
Beware.

00:23:20.025 --> 00:23:20.734
What a change.

00:23:20.744 --> 00:23:23.734
The first six of these
are such positive things.

00:23:23.794 --> 00:23:27.764
Being thankful, you know,
being a rock, being a tree.

00:23:27.924 --> 00:23:30.724
And now he's saying beware.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.740
Take heed.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.020
Be concerned.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.750
This is a warning.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:40.580
See to it that no one takes you captive.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.890
Do not become kidnapped.

00:23:43.785 --> 00:23:45.025
Make sure they don't carry you away.

00:23:45.055 --> 00:23:47.195
Make sure no one leads you astray.

00:23:47.305 --> 00:23:48.715
Make sure no one seduces you.

00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:51.405
Make no, make sure no one enslaves you.

00:23:51.405 --> 00:23:51.615
Why?

00:23:51.615 --> 00:23:54.265
Because there are people out there,
there are philosophies out there

00:23:54.455 --> 00:23:57.365
that want to do that in our lives.

00:23:57.915 --> 00:23:59.675
So how do we continue to walk?

00:23:59.864 --> 00:24:03.055
We need to make sure we're
protecting ourselves.

00:24:07.155 --> 00:24:08.965
So how do they take us captive?

00:24:09.055 --> 00:24:12.955
They take us captive through
hollow and deceptive philosophy.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:16.840
Philosophy is not bad.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.610
Philosophy means a seeking after wisdom.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:22.760
That's, that's good.

00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:27.469
The time that philosophy becomes bad is
when it's hollow, and when it's deceptive.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.430
It's, it's hollow.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:29.150
It's empty.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.380
There's nothing there.

00:24:30.839 --> 00:24:36.100
I, I remember, uh, as a kid getting a, a
chocolate, uh, Easter bunny for Easter.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.490
I thought, man, this is gonna be great.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:39.370
And I, I took it and I took a big bite.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.270
It was hollow inside.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:41.710
I thought, what a disappointment that is.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:42.619
A hollow bunny.

00:24:43.245 --> 00:24:44.675
I thought it was going
to be solid chocolate.

00:24:44.885 --> 00:24:47.925
You know, that's kind of what,
what these philosophies can do.

00:24:48.125 --> 00:24:50.215
The ones these are, they look good, man.

00:24:50.215 --> 00:24:54.225
It's chocolate on the outside and you take
a bite and you find out it's empty inside.

00:24:56.865 --> 00:24:57.884
They're deceptive.

00:24:58.184 --> 00:25:01.855
This Greek word for deceptive, it means,
you might even want to write this down.

00:25:02.205 --> 00:25:04.005
It means, Deceptive.

00:25:05.635 --> 00:25:06.265
Uh huh.

00:25:06.515 --> 00:25:06.845
Uh huh.

00:25:07.965 --> 00:25:10.305
It looks like one thing, but it's not.

00:25:11.305 --> 00:25:14.524
Again, as a kid, I remember my
mom bringing out this beautiful

00:25:14.534 --> 00:25:18.655
bowl of fruit, putting it on the
living room table and walking away.

00:25:18.745 --> 00:25:19.575
Didn't say anything to me.

00:25:19.734 --> 00:25:20.534
Just walked away.

00:25:20.534 --> 00:25:21.135
I thought, man.

00:25:21.724 --> 00:25:25.315
Soon as mom gets out of sight,
I got my eye on this apple.

00:25:25.375 --> 00:25:27.965
Shiny, beautiful, red apple.

00:25:28.085 --> 00:25:31.425
So soon as she's out of sight, I
make a beeline there, and I grab that

00:25:31.425 --> 00:25:33.475
apple, and I take a bite, and it's wax.

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:37.170
It looked like one thing.

00:25:37.855 --> 00:25:41.635
Very deceptive because it was
something totally different.

00:25:42.235 --> 00:25:47.365
Don't get captive by something
that's hollow and deceptive.

00:25:47.994 --> 00:25:51.635
Something that depends on human tradition
and the basic principles of this world.

00:25:51.875 --> 00:25:56.295
I picked, I picked this, this picture
for, for this screen because it is

00:25:56.295 --> 00:25:57.675
the beginning of Fiddler on the Roof.

00:25:57.675 --> 00:25:59.605
Anybody familiar with Fiddler
on the Roof as a musical?

00:25:59.705 --> 00:26:01.315
Yeah, and they come out
and they say, Tradition!

00:26:02.375 --> 00:26:02.465
Tradition!

00:26:03.085 --> 00:26:06.375
You know, and it's all
about great traditions.

00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:07.245
Another good word.

00:26:07.305 --> 00:26:08.585
I love traditions.

00:26:08.895 --> 00:26:11.065
We have, we have birthday
parties just about probably all

00:26:11.065 --> 00:26:12.195
of you have a birthday party.

00:26:12.195 --> 00:26:13.165
It's kind of a tradition.

00:26:13.495 --> 00:26:16.394
You know, we have a lot of traditions
in our house that go along with that

00:26:16.394 --> 00:26:18.604
birthday party, but that's a good thing.

00:26:19.004 --> 00:26:21.305
Christmas really is a tradition.

00:26:21.504 --> 00:26:24.335
We don't know what day Jesus was
born on, but we traditionally,

00:26:24.465 --> 00:26:26.034
we celebrate it on the 25th.

00:26:26.155 --> 00:26:27.115
It's a good thing.

00:26:28.115 --> 00:26:32.175
Except when Santa kind of
blocks out the nativity.

00:26:32.699 --> 00:26:36.389
And then we've entered into a philosophy
that I would call materialism.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:42.060
Okay, so it's a hollow thing
that's part of that tradition.

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.940
Easter as well, probably the
greatest Sunday of the church year.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.930
Celebrating the resurrection
of Jesus Christ.

00:26:49.999 --> 00:26:52.239
What a great tradition that's at.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:58.410
But again, if the, if the Easter bunny
blocks the, the, uh, the empty tomb.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.139
We've, we've gone to secularism.

00:27:01.699 --> 00:27:05.790
And so there's these philosophies
that can invade us, and destroy

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.880
us, and take us captive.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.449
The basic tradition, the human tradition,
and the basic principles of this world.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.699
That's, that's kind of a more difficult,
philosophical kind of, uh, statement.

00:27:17.709 --> 00:27:20.550
What, what, what does that,
what does that even really mean?

00:27:20.879 --> 00:27:21.919
Basic principles.

00:27:21.939 --> 00:27:23.129
Because basic principles are good.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:26.260
The problem is, it's the
basic principles of the world.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:31.270
And so, the basic principle of
the world is that, uh, all of this

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.820
happened because of the Big Bang.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:37.409
You know, I mean, it's all just
kind of evolutionary stuff.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.470
And when you think about evolution
and the Big Bang theory...

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:47.850
Uh, you have to think that, okay, we
came from something, not sure how it

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:52.680
even started, but it went kaboom, and
it went kaboom, uh, you know, it kind of

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.980
created the universe, and then there's
this little puddle of something, and

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.819
electricity must've hit it, I mean,
uh, lightning must've hit it, and so,

00:27:59.969 --> 00:28:01.479
then all of a sudden, there's life.

00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:07.070
That is so much harder to believe than
just a creator, someone who has this

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.730
master design and actually made it happen.

00:28:11.044 --> 00:28:14.695
But that's the, that's the philosophy,
those basic principles, you know,

00:28:14.695 --> 00:28:18.805
the basic principles of the world
has, have redefined in recent

00:28:18.805 --> 00:28:20.344
years what marriage is all about.

00:28:21.014 --> 00:28:23.635
It's redefined what gender is all about.

00:28:23.675 --> 00:28:28.105
I, I, I happen to just Google genders,
try, try this maybe, no, don't try

00:28:28.105 --> 00:28:34.214
this, uh, some, this afternoon, uh,
but, but I just Googled, uh, gender and

00:28:34.215 --> 00:28:36.845
the first article said the six genders.

00:28:37.435 --> 00:28:38.405
I said six.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.800
Man, I can think of male, I can think
of female, I can even think of neuter,

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.490
couldn't go any further than that.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:53.660
And then the next article down says,
121 gender preferences in 2021, 121,

00:28:54.590 --> 00:29:02.249
I thought something's just a little
messed up on, on, on the principle that

00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:07.829
God made in making us in the, in the
basic principles maybe of this world.

00:29:11.945 --> 00:29:13.925
Kind of a downer of a
way to end, isn't it?

00:29:15.335 --> 00:29:19.595
But I think that Paul's statement
is a very, very sobering one.

00:29:20.645 --> 00:29:26.245
We gotta continue to walk, continue to
walk, continue to hike, to remembering

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.255
back on, on how we found the Lord.

00:29:28.405 --> 00:29:34.455
Be in a, be in a tree, be in a
a, a house, be in a rock learning

00:29:34.905 --> 00:29:36.675
overflowing with thankfulness.

00:29:36.735 --> 00:29:40.804
But don't forget, don't forget to beware.

00:29:45.835 --> 00:29:51.175
Father, I do thank you for your amazing
grace, and I thank you, Lord, for

00:29:51.175 --> 00:29:53.865
the salvation that we have in Jesus.

00:29:54.515 --> 00:29:58.525
And I thank you, Lord, that we
can continue to walk in him.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.110
Because he sends those roots.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.260
He builds us up.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.930
He teaches us.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.220
And so Lord, may you be with us.

00:30:08.489 --> 00:30:09.539
Be with this church.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.959
Lord, I pray that you would
just bless them in Jesus name.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.690
Amen.
