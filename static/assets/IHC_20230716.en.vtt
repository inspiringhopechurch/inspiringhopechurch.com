00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.330
Um, but, anyways, we, we are, uh, again,
as I mentioned earlier, getting ready

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.369
to jump into just a, what I call a mini
series, um, just over Matthew chapter 7.

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:17.040
Um, and if, those of you who have been
here, uh, back when we did our mental

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.399
health series, which was not too long ago,
uh, we actually covered a little bit of

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.260
Matthew chapter 6, uh, about seeking first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness.

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:29.875
Um, and then we also saw the last
two weeks where Dave walked through

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:31.325
the Lord's Prayer in Matthew 6.

00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:34.995
And so, we've actually recently
dealt with a little bit of, um, what

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:36.064
we call the Sermon on the Mount.

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:38.444
Which is usually Matthew
chapter 5 through 7.

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:42.495
And so, whenever I was praying
and walking through just...

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.989
Um, The Gospels this summer,
because obviously I haven't

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.029
preached in the last three weeks.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.500
Um, God just brought Matthew 7 to my
heart, and as I've been reading over

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.649
it, Um, typically, I would say Matthew
7 is one of those that is pastors.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:57.960
It's like, this is going to be fun.

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:04.004
And whenever I see texts like this, I go,
you know, it's probably good for me to

00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:06.045
preach through tough texts in the Bible.

00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:09.105
Because most of us are probably
saying, you know, I have

00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:10.155
some questions about that.

00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:13.775
And so whenever I stepped off
into this, I was like, I even

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:14.974
have some questions about this.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:16.985
Um, so I think this
will be valuable for us.

00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:18.965
I'm hoping that it'll be beneficial
for those of you who'll be able

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:21.025
to be here for the next several
weeks to walk through this.

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:26.994
Um, but, uh, we're gonna talk
about judge not lest you be judged.

00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:32.244
So, question, anybody ever had
somebody tell you not to judge them?

00:01:32.254 --> 00:01:34.624
Or have you ever told
somebody not to judge you?

00:01:34.674 --> 00:01:35.384
Anybody, let's go.

00:01:36.394 --> 00:01:38.094
Hey, we got several
hands that got up, right?

00:01:38.584 --> 00:01:41.994
Typically, we will hear people say that,
hey, the Bible even says don't judge.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.520
Unless you be judged.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.470
Uh, and so what you'll find in the church
world is one of usually two things.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.150
You'll find, uh, people who don't
want to judge at all, because they're

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.550
fearful of this scripture that says
don't judge unless you be judged.

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:01.289
And then you'll have those who know
this scripture, but then they're like,

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.200
but the Bible says, you know, sin is
sin, and, and we're called to call out

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.250
sin, so we're gonna, we're gonna judge.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.420
Righteously, we're going to go through
and grab the Bible, and what we would

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.400
call, we call those people Bible thumpers.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.410
They literally carry their Bible around.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.700
They, and they don't practically, like,
they don't hit you across the head.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.700
Maybe, you know, you're, you
did, but they, they verbally

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.890
do that with the Word of God.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.070
Trying to make you feel less than them.

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.629
So that's typically where, if any
of us have dealt with judgment,

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:29.849
or this, you know, judgment text.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.609
You've kind of, some of you
are somewhere in the middle.

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.389
You've probably been part
of a good church where...

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.010
Pastors help you learn a little bit
more about judging, and so because

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.640
of that, we really want to kind
of jump off into this and see what

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.180
God's word has to say about judging.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.210
Um, and I think this, whenever I
think about Christians or churches,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.760
they typically get a bad rap
when it comes to judging others.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.469
Uh, and really it comes across as this, as
most people will say, Hey, most churches

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.019
think that they're holier than me.

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:01.619
They think they're better than me.

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:04.640
But that church, that
person is a hypocrite.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.719
Anybody ever heard that?

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.579
All people, all Christians
are just hypocrites.

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:13.045
You know, honestly, we
probably are at times.

00:03:13.845 --> 00:03:15.565
They don't necessarily have that wrong.

00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:19.655
Um, but there, there's, we get this bad
rap, and usually it's because we walk

00:03:19.674 --> 00:03:23.125
around and, and I say we, I'm using this
as a general statement of the fact of

00:03:23.864 --> 00:03:27.965
trying to view this from a standpoint of
where we're, we're talking with people

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:30.644
who have probably been hurt by the church,
or maybe don't attend the church, or

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:32.824
maybe you're in the church and you've
been hurt by somebody that's done this,

00:03:32.824 --> 00:03:38.045
but typically we, rather than going
in love to someone, we go in judgment.

00:03:38.054 --> 00:03:39.655
We go and we say, hey, you're a sinner.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:42.975
You should read your Bible.

00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:44.165
You should pray more.

00:03:44.355 --> 00:03:45.625
You should go to church more.

00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:50.295
And, and again, those things are all good,
but it's usually out of a judgmental tone.

00:03:50.685 --> 00:03:54.265
Um, you'll even come up to some
people, um, that you don't even know,

00:03:54.265 --> 00:03:55.424
and I've seen some people do this.

00:03:55.424 --> 00:03:57.685
They walk right up to them and
say, you know, you shouldn't drink.

00:03:58.024 --> 00:03:59.125
You know, you shouldn't smoke.

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:00.454
You know where that's going to send you.

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:02.495
That's going to send you
to hell in a handbasket.

00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:03.445
Anybody ever heard that one?

00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:05.045
See, that's another problem.

00:04:05.065 --> 00:04:09.335
Again, so you all understand, I
believe most people that say those

00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:12.415
statements are saying them because
they think that they're helping people.

00:04:14.805 --> 00:04:19.094
And ultimately, as we're going to learn
today, is are we supposed to judge people?

00:04:20.255 --> 00:04:24.804
Short answer, that absolutely, 100%,
there is a right way to go about it.

00:04:25.174 --> 00:04:27.525
And Jesus is going to clearly do that.

00:04:27.525 --> 00:04:31.654
And so, I just know this, whether it's
the major things that we talk about

00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:34.354
in judgment, but I would say this, I'm
just going to make a blanket statement.

00:04:34.905 --> 00:04:37.445
Everybody in this room has
judged someone at some point.

00:04:38.175 --> 00:04:42.405
Odds are, on a Sunday morning,
if you've watched anybody walk

00:04:42.405 --> 00:04:45.355
in this room, you probably looked
at somebody and judged somebody.

00:04:45.415 --> 00:04:49.934
By the way they look, by the way
they act, by the way their kids

00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:54.705
act, by what they wore, by how
they didn't look at you correctly.

00:04:54.705 --> 00:04:55.355
You judged them.

00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:58.125
We're all guilty of judging.

00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:00.675
So, that's really where
the heart of this starts.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.140
It's when we don't realize
that we are all guilty of sin

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.190
and when it comes to judgment.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.130
And so we're going to answer
a couple questions today.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.910
The question is, are we supposed to judge?

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.310
And the answer to that is yes, but we're
going to see what God says in his word.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.859
But number one, if we are, then
what's the purpose behind judging?

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.279
So I hope we'll understand this together.

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.979
So we're in Matthew chapter seven.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.490
We're going to read verses
one through six together.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.880
Those verses should be
up on the screen today.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.620
If they're not.

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:26.905
I think they are.

00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:28.715
So, let's look at this together.

00:05:28.715 --> 00:05:32.675
So it says this, Do not judge
so that you won't be judged.

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:37.165
For you will be judged by the same
standard with which you judge others.

00:05:37.514 --> 00:05:40.684
And you will be measured by
the same measure you use.

00:05:41.214 --> 00:05:44.704
Why do you look at the splinter in
your brother's eye, but don't notice

00:05:44.734 --> 00:05:47.004
the beam of wood in your own eye?

00:05:47.455 --> 00:05:51.555
Or how can you say to your brother, Let
me take the splinter out of your eye.

00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:54.905
And look, there's a beam
of wood in your own eye.

00:05:55.515 --> 00:05:56.344
Hypocrite.

00:05:56.955 --> 00:05:59.434
First take the beam of
wood out of your own eye.

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:03.364
And then you will see clearly to take
the splinter out of your brother's eye.

00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:08.005
Don't give what is holy to the dogs, or
toss your pearls before pigs, or they will

00:06:08.005 --> 00:06:13.995
be trampled, uh, trample them under their
feet, and turn, and tear you to pieces.

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:14.789
So let's pray.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.000
Lord Jesus, we pray, Lord, as we dive
into your word, that you help each one

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.310
of us, including myself, Lord, understand
the heart of judgment and what that means

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.539
and, and the, and Lord, what your goal
in judging is and, and what our goal in

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:35.640
judging is, and Lord, I pray that we all
leave out of here with some encouragement,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.849
Lord, with some direction, and Lord,
I pray that if someone comes up to us

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:43.880
after today's message, I pray if someone
comes up to us, Lord, and they say, don't

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.700
judge me, We're able, we're able to come
across and share with them love and share

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.729
with them the truth that we learned from
this word so that we can help them come

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:59.839
to know you and Lord help us understand
our place and our role in this and so

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.839
we just pray this in your name amen.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.880
So we're going to jump off into a little
bit of the background I want to kind

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.489
of touch on this because sometimes we
just jump off into text and we don't

00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:09.989
understand what we're dealing with.

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:14.030
So the book of Matthew is wrote by one
of Jesus disciples and this is what

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.250
I I would say Matthew is one of those
disciples that took notes in class.

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:20.320
Uh, I'm not that guy.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.159
I'm typically the guy that goes
and listens to the lecture.

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:25.750
And I tell you bits and pieces that
I remember and that's good for me.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.150
But I'm so thankful that
Matthew was a note taker.

00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:34.029
And so Matthew wrote out really a
lot of Jesus life and his story.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.930
And he put them into this book, and we
know that he's one of the disciples,

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.890
one of the, uh, ones that wrote the
gospel, so Matthew, Mark, Luke, and

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.380
John, that all share some of the
same, similar accounts of Jesus.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.260
And so, when we look at this, we
look at just the first couple of

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.219
chapters of Matthew, chapters 1
through 3, and really those chapters

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.090
connect Jesus to the Old Testament.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.700
And really it connects Jesus, uh, and how
he fulfills the Old Testament prophecy.

00:08:00.075 --> 00:08:05.224
And so after that connection, we go into
chapters 4 through 7, and this is when

00:08:05.224 --> 00:08:11.025
we see Jesus announcing and teaching the
arrival of the kingdom of God, right?

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:15.635
And God's rescue plan for Jesus to
come to the world to save sinners.

00:08:16.175 --> 00:08:19.735
Um, right, he begins to explain how
he's come to confront evil and to

00:08:19.735 --> 00:08:22.955
restore God's kingdom into a new family.

00:08:23.405 --> 00:08:28.165
But then he takes his followers up onto
this mount, or this mountain, right?

00:08:28.165 --> 00:08:28.795
And we talk about...

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.039
Um, this, this, uh, sermon on the Mount
and he takes them up there to teach

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.260
them how to live in God's kingdom.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.579
And so, I don't know about you guys,
but if, if Jesus took his followers

00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:43.520
to go teach them how to live in the
kingdom of God, do you think this, these

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.140
are valuable things for us to learn.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.480
One of you agrees and the
rest of you are just here.

00:08:49.995 --> 00:08:50.605
Praise God.

00:08:50.665 --> 00:08:52.285
I'm hoping you'll show up
in a couple of minutes.

00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:57.765
So God, I believe, had this Sermon on
the Mount not only for His followers

00:08:57.845 --> 00:08:59.885
in that day, but it was for us today.

00:08:59.885 --> 00:09:02.475
It's still practical for us today, right?

00:09:02.824 --> 00:09:06.895
And so He begins to share several
things with His listeners to guide

00:09:06.895 --> 00:09:08.885
them in this new way of life.

00:09:09.275 --> 00:09:12.574
In their old way of life, they were
taught typically by the religious

00:09:12.574 --> 00:09:15.444
leaders, which he's going to kind
of confront in these statements.

00:09:15.704 --> 00:09:20.344
And so because they had a bad example
from their previous religious examples,

00:09:20.834 --> 00:09:25.394
Jesus is trying to help transform
their thinking into the thinking of

00:09:25.395 --> 00:09:27.505
the way, the new way of how to...

00:09:28.064 --> 00:09:28.995
Follow Jesus.

00:09:29.355 --> 00:09:31.665
Um, and when we look at this
audience, this audience was a group

00:09:31.665 --> 00:09:35.775
of believers, but many believe as the
crowds grew every day as he began to

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:39.255
share, um, and there was unbelievers
and believers in this audience.

00:09:39.255 --> 00:09:45.375
And so, um, we're gonna jump off into
now this idea of what is judgment and

00:09:45.375 --> 00:09:48.225
are we supposed to judge, I'm gonna kind
of walk through this and kind of build

00:09:48.225 --> 00:09:51.915
this, hopefully at the end where we'll
will see us a lesson to take home today.

00:09:52.275 --> 00:09:54.405
But what is judgment and
what is it supposed to be?

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.074
So when you look at this, the
practical stance of judgment,

00:09:57.345 --> 00:10:01.185
judgment, Is to pronounce an
opinion concerning right and wrong.

00:10:01.185 --> 00:10:04.574
So judging someone is having an
opinion whether what they're doing

00:10:04.595 --> 00:10:06.635
or not doing is right or wrong.

00:10:06.635 --> 00:10:06.824
Right?

00:10:06.824 --> 00:10:07.944
That's practical and simple.

00:10:08.515 --> 00:10:09.805
But are we able to judge?

00:10:09.805 --> 00:10:12.574
And I think verse five, we could go
a couple of different verses in the

00:10:12.574 --> 00:10:16.625
Bible to talk about how Jesus says that
we are to judge, but I think we just

00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:18.355
have to go to verse five to say this.

00:10:18.574 --> 00:10:19.685
Yes, we are.

00:10:20.095 --> 00:10:23.365
Even though he says, don't judge and we'll
talk about what that word judge means.

00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:26.215
But in verse five, if you'll
even look at this again, he

00:10:26.215 --> 00:10:28.215
says, hypocrite, which is Great.

00:10:28.235 --> 00:10:29.194
We'll talk about that later.

00:10:29.194 --> 00:10:33.005
He says, first, take the beam of
wood out of your own eye, and then

00:10:33.005 --> 00:10:37.355
you will see clearly to take the
splinter out of someone else's eye.

00:10:37.605 --> 00:10:44.105
So in that explanation, Jesus is saying,
you have a role in making a judgment of

00:10:44.105 --> 00:10:47.335
someone else's life and helping them.

00:10:47.755 --> 00:10:51.185
So we are supposed to judge,
but yet the first verse says,

00:10:51.415 --> 00:10:52.815
judge not unless you be judged.

00:10:53.415 --> 00:10:56.235
So whenever we look at that
word judge, what does that mean?

00:10:56.245 --> 00:10:58.725
And I'm, I'm not great with these
things, but I, whenever I begin

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:02.355
to study them, the tense of the
verb judge really significant,

00:11:02.355 --> 00:11:05.335
signifies a once and final judgment.

00:11:05.985 --> 00:11:08.845
It's not our role and responsibility
to condemn people to hell.

00:11:09.254 --> 00:11:14.005
It's not our role and responsibility to
tell them that, um, you fully believe

00:11:14.005 --> 00:11:18.115
they are going to hell and that Jesus
is, is definitely going to judge you.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.370
What we are called to do is to
share truth that reveals them.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.140
Ultimately, God is the judge.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.310
And I mean, here's the thing, we can
make some basis statements where we

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.590
say, Hey, based on the fruit of their
life, they're probably not saved.

00:11:30.349 --> 00:11:32.549
They may not be following the ways
of Jesus, but ultimately we are

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.070
not called to make that judgment.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.490
That is only the place.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.290
So when he says this, basically another
way that Jesus is explaining to us in

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.950
judging is to say that we are supposed
to make assessments or judgments

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.070
of someone's life to edify them.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.100
I'm going to that, right?

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.040
To encourage them, to overcome
their sin, not to condemn them.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:58.860
Typically, when we think about
judgment, judgment is convicting

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.880
because we think that people are,
are really thinking less of us, but

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.940
really in judging, we're supposed
to be judging in a way of helping.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.050
But, has anybody ever had somebody
judge them in a way that's helped you?

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:11.830
Anybody?

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.470
A couple of you?

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:13.880
Okay.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.110
I would say most of the time,
it feels very condemning.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.970
And this is where I say
Christians get a bad rap.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.870
And why I think today is important
for us to understand there is a right

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.140
and there is a wrong way to judge.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.930
And so Jesus is correcting
those who would say that they're

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.269
trying to pass final judgment.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:35.330
And where did the people that Jesus
was talking to learn this from?

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:35.970
The Pharisees.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.940
The Pharisees were great at
telling people, If you don't

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.395
follow every one of these laws,
You're not right with God at all.

00:12:44.395 --> 00:12:49.605
And you're going to know, but they never
took into understanding that that level of

00:12:49.605 --> 00:12:55.475
expectation they placed on them was going
to be placed on them in judgment as well.

00:12:55.844 --> 00:12:59.414
They clearly thought of themselves
more righteous and they were making

00:12:59.415 --> 00:13:03.335
judgments, but yet not internally
reflecting on their own sin.

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:08.095
And so as believers, we are called
to judge and make assessments.

00:13:08.095 --> 00:13:10.305
And one of the, I think this is,
we begin to think about this,

00:13:10.305 --> 00:13:11.515
one of the most unloving things.

00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:16.215
that we can do is to see someone heading
towards destruction and turn a blind eye.

00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:17.735
Think about this.

00:13:17.735 --> 00:13:23.585
If you saw someone drowning and you had
a life, you know, saving device or you

00:13:23.585 --> 00:13:27.285
have the ability to save them and for
you to turn, because you don't want to

00:13:27.285 --> 00:13:30.914
judge them for whatever mistake they made
to get in the water and start drowning.

00:13:30.915 --> 00:13:32.225
You don't want to judge them.

00:13:32.235 --> 00:13:33.465
You're going to turn your back.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.570
Wouldn't you think that'd
be a little bit silly?

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.460
So when we practically think
about this, and we think, I'm

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.470
not supposed to judge anybody.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.750
No, we are.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.230
But in a helpful way,
not in a condemning way.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.280
I'm just telling you, a practical
example of people and Christians

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.150
judging the incorrectly way, is
seeing the person drowning and

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.120
saying, you did it to yourself.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.650
You're gonna die, and they're
sitting there, I know, like, help me.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.090
I think most people that are
living a life apart from God, in

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:04.930
some way, are asking for help.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.419
Now, they may not completely tell you
that, but their life begins to reflect

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:14.200
that, because many of the things that
people are living, their lives apart

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.320
from Christ, are trying to fulfill
a need that only Christ can fill.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.180
And it never fulfills them.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:25.570
Drugs, alcohol, sex, uh, family, job.

00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:27.965
Greed, money, you name it.

00:14:27.975 --> 00:14:31.395
They're trying to pursue these
things and it's not fulfilling them.

00:14:31.625 --> 00:14:33.275
They are asking for help.

00:14:34.965 --> 00:14:38.604
And I would say, at times as
Christians, all we want to do is

00:14:38.605 --> 00:14:39.905
point out what they're doing wrong.

00:14:40.244 --> 00:14:42.934
Rather than to get down in the
ditch and say, you know what?

00:14:44.475 --> 00:14:45.405
I, I've been there.

00:14:45.825 --> 00:14:46.335
I get it.

00:14:47.325 --> 00:14:48.255
And there's a better way.

00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:49.125
And there's a greater way.

00:14:49.755 --> 00:14:52.515
So we've learned here that
there's not a right way to

00:14:52.515 --> 00:14:54.165
judge or in, in that way, right?

00:14:54.165 --> 00:14:55.635
That's, that's not the right way.

00:14:56.355 --> 00:15:00.345
But we need to judge
out of a heart of love.

00:15:00.375 --> 00:15:03.885
And so the sticking point is we
must be motivated by love, right?

00:15:03.885 --> 00:15:05.475
Love for God, and love for people.

00:15:05.985 --> 00:15:08.115
We are called to judge sin, and
I think this is so important.

00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:10.665
We're called to judge
sin, but not preference.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.240
style or traditions.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.650
And I believe this in the conversations
that I've had even more recently,

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.530
I'm gonna share some of those.

00:15:19.109 --> 00:15:23.910
I believe most people are turned
off by the church because of our

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:29.459
judgment of styles and what people
look like and don't look like and

00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:32.560
specifically how they perfectly live
out their life or what they don't.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.720
And I just want to give
you guys a great example.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.060
I was in a church in Oklahoma
and I remember one day seeing a

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.249
new person come to our church.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:39.850
Praise God.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.260
Love new people coming to our church.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.800
And I had a member come over
to me and they said, Did you

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.840
see that new person coming in?

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.110
And I said, Yeah, praise God.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.850
He said, Did you see he was
wearing a hat into the sanctuary?

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:51.860
And I went, What?

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.690
What did you just say?

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.870
He says, Did you see he wore
a hat into the sanctuary?

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.650
That's not allowed.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.660
That's not okay.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.850
This is God's house.

00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:01.980
And I kind of was laughing
thinking he was joking.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.360
And he wasn't.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.830
He was more worried about
that guy's hat on his head.

00:16:07.285 --> 00:16:08.725
That he was worried about that guy's soul.

00:16:10.105 --> 00:16:12.335
Do you, I mean, you guys probably
know this because I know many of

00:16:12.335 --> 00:16:14.565
you, it's hard to come into a church.

00:16:15.045 --> 00:16:19.385
For the majority of the world to walk
in the doors of a church, it is hard.

00:16:20.325 --> 00:16:22.655
Because they're fearful of being judged.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.930
And I'll just tell you, that
day was proof of why people are

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.080
fearful to come to the church.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:33.529
Because we're more worried about what
people look like, or don't look like.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.349
Or perfectly act like, or
don't perfectly act like.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:41.690
When we forgot to look in the mirror
ourselves and see our broken condition, so

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:47.270
that when we show up on Sunday mornings,
we're so thankful for the grace of God

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.910
and how we can extend it to others.

00:16:50.155 --> 00:16:51.385
Who've never experienced it.

00:16:52.215 --> 00:16:54.205
It's amazing that that has happened.

00:16:54.695 --> 00:16:57.465
And I think this too many
times as a church, we're

00:16:57.465 --> 00:16:59.674
known more for as Christians.

00:16:59.715 --> 00:17:03.125
We're known more for what we're
against than what we're for.

00:17:03.905 --> 00:17:06.345
We're known more for that.

00:17:06.345 --> 00:17:07.694
We care just about.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.390
You've given your life to Jesus
only, and about you repenting of

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.110
your sins, and not just about you.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.170
And that sounds so bad.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.060
So hear what I'm saying.

00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:17.560
I want every person to experience
a relationship with Jesus.

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.380
But I think too many times
we come forward with this.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.660
You're a sinner going to hell.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.490
Are you going to repent?

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.450
And I'm like, hey, why don't you
just ask, hey, what's your name?

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:29.730
How are you doing?

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.720
How's your day going?

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:34.480
Life's been pretty tough lately.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.020
Can I sit with you and
talk a little bit longer?

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.260
Now, I want them to know Jesus.

00:17:40.469 --> 00:17:43.470
I want them to know that one day, if they
do not repent of their sins, that they

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.790
will spend an eternity separated from God.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.370
I want to share that.

00:17:47.815 --> 00:17:53.885
But I think too many times, as Christians
and as churches, we start with judging.

00:17:54.755 --> 00:17:57.115
And then later on, it's like, oh
yeah, what was your name again?

00:17:58.355 --> 00:18:01.765
And that's the wrong way, and we're
gonna see how Jesus explains this, right?

00:18:01.765 --> 00:18:03.515
So where do we start?

00:18:04.265 --> 00:18:04.945
Where do we start?

00:18:05.695 --> 00:18:08.065
We start with knowing not how to judge.

00:18:08.065 --> 00:18:10.075
We talked a little bit about this, but
I want to walk through these couple

00:18:10.075 --> 00:18:12.834
of verses really quick to kind of
emphasize a couple of these things.

00:18:12.835 --> 00:18:15.665
He says, do not judge so that you won't
be judged, for you'll be judged with

00:18:15.675 --> 00:18:21.065
the same standard or measure as you
measure, as you judge others with, right?

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.760
So they had followed the Pharisees
in these examples, right?

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.880
They'd seen the Pharisees do
this, and so Jesus is trying to

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.750
change their mentality with this.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.150
Uh, the Pharisees were trying
to play God in essence.

00:18:33.689 --> 00:18:39.479
And so when we think about our world,
and we think about judging, Um, some of

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.930
the things that we will make statements.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.460
And so, some of you may say, well
that doesn't happen in the church.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.910
Let me just give you a
couple that I've heard.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.430
If they believe in that and
follow that political party,

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.650
there's no way they can be saved.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.190
Anybody ever heard that one before?

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.490
And I'm not even defining either one.

00:18:54.499 --> 00:18:55.300
You ever heard that one?

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.060
Have you ever heard somebody say this?

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.869
Did you know that so and so went to a
Reds game last week and missed church?

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.179
And that's the third week in a row.

00:19:02.469 --> 00:19:04.720
Could they be a believer if
they don't come to church?

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.790
You ever heard that one?

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.140
I mean, that happens occasionally, right?

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.510
So if you went to the Reds
games last week, guaranteed,

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.520
you're not a believer, okay?

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.590
Just wanna let you guys know that.

00:19:15.809 --> 00:19:16.980
Just joking, okay?

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.119
We can laugh in here, right?

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.209
Gosh, you guys are a tough crowd today.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.340
So, when we think about this, right,
when us Christians, right, judge

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.570
someone in such a way that we make
ourselves look better, that's where

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.169
Jesus is talking about this judgment.

00:19:33.619 --> 00:19:35.269
We will be judged by that same measure.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.000
Let me just explain this.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.820
Sin is sin.

00:19:38.709 --> 00:19:41.739
We're all no better than someone else,
so let me just give you a great example.

00:19:41.739 --> 00:19:45.560
If I am judging or making a judgment
of someone, and I'm just going to

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.870
do this right now to help you here,
I'm going to judge Jason right now.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.629
Jason's been having his eyes closed.

00:19:50.139 --> 00:19:51.179
I'm just joking, I don't have any clue.

00:19:51.439 --> 00:19:52.719
Jason's been having his eyes closed.

00:19:53.139 --> 00:19:56.259
You know, I just think he's
just, he doesn't even care to be

00:19:56.259 --> 00:19:58.310
here, and he's just here because
Christina made him be here.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.790
Now I didn't say that out loud,
but I thought that in my head.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.370
And you know what I'm
going to say as well?

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:04.480
I'm here, I'm wide awake.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.330
You know, I showed up.

00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:08.110
I showed up caring about this message.

00:20:10.689 --> 00:20:12.520
Y'all know that you think of some
of those things, you look around.

00:20:12.659 --> 00:20:15.360
So what I'm saying is, I was
in here thinking about how poor

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.129
Jason was, and how great I am.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.240
Most of our judgments, when we make
judgments, is this, when we begin

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.300
to judge in that way, aren't we
sinners when we judge in that way?

00:20:26.665 --> 00:20:28.965
Here's the thing, and this is
something I think is so critical.

00:20:29.775 --> 00:20:33.285
When we do make judgments like
that, we may be right in the

00:20:33.285 --> 00:20:34.305
way in which someone's living.

00:20:34.305 --> 00:20:35.665
Not Jason, so I'm not
talking about that right.

00:20:35.815 --> 00:20:40.665
But we may be right in the judgment
in which we made about that person.

00:20:40.675 --> 00:20:42.245
They may be living in sin.

00:20:42.525 --> 00:20:47.845
But the moment that we judge in such a way
that makes us righteous and them not, us

00:20:47.865 --> 00:20:53.005
better than them not, we will be judged
with the same standard, which means this,

00:20:53.255 --> 00:20:55.255
we have just sinned for the sin of pride.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:00.410
See, when Jesus saw crowds, He didn't go,
those worthless sinners, how dare they?

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:02.880
He had compassion.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:04.330
He had concern.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.010
He says they were distressed and rejected.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:07.930
I, just translate this.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.770
It could be people that were on
the streets selling their bodies.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:18.130
It could be people who were
basically worthless and homeless.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.570
It could be people that were
homeless because of their own faults.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.100
It could be brokenness in homes
and kids that weren't acting right.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.390
And this is how he would translate
it, distress and dejected people.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.570
And he didn't judge them.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:35.790
Technically, he didn't make judgments.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.540
He was compassionate once
he realized their condition.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:39.960
He was compassionate.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.930
What does it mean to be compassionate?

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.910
I've shared this in multiple
different ways, but I want to share

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.400
it the best way that I possibly can.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.650
When I think of compassion, it's a deep
down desire that you have to do something.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.510
And y'all know this, in about a couple
hours, you're going to deep down inside

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:54.980
want to eat because you're hungry.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.240
But what I imagine compassion
is not eating for two days.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.630
Days, three days, four days.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.020
And so desiring to eat, to nourish
yourself, that's compassion.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:09.180
When you see people that aren't living
the way that God's called them to, they're

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.470
living a second rate life, a life that
is not beneficial for them, rather than

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.810
judging them, we so desire to help them.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:20.720
That's what Jesus has called us
to do when we think about judging.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.840
So we have compassion, right?

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.980
Not necessarily judgment.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.960
I wanna give you guys a couple of
examples here, and this is how.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.110
So we have a mission team in this week.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.350
If you don't know this, there's a
mission team in the back row here.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.890
Um, that came in from Tulsa, Oklahoma to
come and help serve our city this week.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.280
I just want to give you a couple
things that we got to do this week.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.610
Number one, um, we got to write some
encouraging cards to teachers, which is

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.240
so awesome because I love to do that.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.740
Number two, we got the opportunity to
serve along, serve the city this week.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.230
The homeless community, food
pantry, um, which is amazing.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.140
Um, we got to do some more stuff.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.270
Clean the gym that I work for and be
able to love on them and support them.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.180
Um, we've got to go canvassing,
uh, door to door and invite people

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.270
to an event in a couple of weeks.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.690
We've got to do several different things.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:06.850
And I'm so thankful for you guys.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.150
Thank you so much for coming
and serving alongside us.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.200
It means so much.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.920
Um, but we were doing this yesterday.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:13.500
It was Friday.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.570
Um, we were canvassing and
walking around the neighborhood.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.100
Uh, and it's this moment.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:18.280
I'll just tell you guys this.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.730
And I'm going to say this.

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:20.380
Don't judge me.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.340
Um, but walking around, and you're
walking around a little bit rougher

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.570
neighborhood in our community.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.760
And the first thoughts that
want to go through my head is...

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:31.870
Man, these are some rough houses.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:32.800
How did they get here?

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.030
Right?

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.860
And I want to start kind
of judging a little bit.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.050
And then quickly, I'm walking through
this text this week, quickly I'm going,

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.560
no, I have compassion for these people.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.700
And so I said, in my heart, in
my mind, I'm like, I'm going to

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.190
approach people differently today.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.120
If somebody answers, then I'm
going to approach them differently.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.020
And God gave me that opportunity,
literally, I think it was like the

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.640
first house that we walked into.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.050
I think it was the first
house that I walked into.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:54.970
I mean, you walked into their house,
I think I went to a person outside.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.560
And I started talking to this
lady, and she's basically blind,

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.330
old, and she's had a difficult...

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:05.290
life and rough church experience and
I begin to hear her and it's those

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.930
moments where I know I'm supposed to
be canvassing and I just sat down.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.450
I sat down on the concrete
and just listened to her.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.860
Just listen to her story.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:14.620
Listen to all she's went through.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:19.400
And there would have been many times
for me to be like, man, how dare you?

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.350
And all I did, I was just, I was
burned over what she's going through.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.280
And I just encouraged her
and some truth of her life.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.730
She had some deceiving, uh, thoughts
that really were not good for her.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.910
And I just began to speak
as much life as I could.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:32.920
And it was a great experience.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.960
Got to pray with her.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.240
Walked away from that experience just
really encouraged, and right towards

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.740
the end of our canvassing there was
three guys on a porch, um, and, and

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.920
here's the great thing is, we walk up,
we talk to them, we invite them, kind

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.420
of walk away, and he hollered out, Hey!

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.210
We came back.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:48.920
And we just started talking.

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.530
And I asked the question, I said,
Hey, do any of you go to church?

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.210
No, not really, no, whatever.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.110
And I said, Uh, why not?

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.100
Uh, I said, Is it because you
feel like the judge in you?

00:24:59.480 --> 00:24:59.930
Yeah.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.170
Yeah, it's hard to walk into a
church when they're not teaching

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.210
truth, they're hypocrites.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:05.690
I'm like, I just heard all this!

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.610
These are three guys that won't darken
the doors of a church because they

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.950
think of churches as hypocrites,
people that judge them, okay?

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.720
Now that may be their own
fault, because maybe churches

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.060
aren't that way, all of them.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.130
But that's them completely
explained to me in this.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.200
And so it reminded me, and I love how
God sets this up, it reminded me that

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.000
there are many people in this world that
need us to show compassion and love.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.880
You know what I told them?

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.910
I said, what are they judging about?

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.380
Oh, this, this, this, this, okay.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.540
And I started thinking,
you know, I'm a sinner too.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:34.910
I'm in need of some much
grace as those guys.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.660
And I'll just take this today.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.480
I'm so glad.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.490
I'm so glad, if you don't know this, we
have planted a church, started a church

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.660
that welcomes sinful and broken people.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:47.790
And honestly, that's everybody.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:51.280
If you didn't know that coming
in, I'm sorry, but we're all

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.430
sinful and broken people.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.830
There's not one of us
righteous in this room.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:55.430
Not one.

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.640
The only one that was righteous
was Jesus, and that's who we are

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.290
constantly pointing each other to.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.490
And this is the place to be.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:06.670
We call it the judgment free zone, and
the fact of like condemning judgment,

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.880
because we'll let God do that.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.630
We're here to bring truth and love.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.610
For repentance, but truth and love
and, and I love this, when we think

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:21.050
about what Jesus came to do, he says
this in John three 16 through 17,

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:22.370
and most people just stop at 16.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:23.270
I want to kind of share this.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:29.080
So for God so loved the world in this
way, he gave, he didn't judge, he

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:33.100
gave right his one and only son so
that everyone who believes in him will

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.720
not perish, but have eternal life.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:36.160
And I love 17.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.920
Cause most of the time we stop at John
three 16, most people can memorize that.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.670
We just stop.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.551
Here's what 17 says, for God did
not send his son into the wall.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.180
To condemn the world, but to
save the world through him.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.110
Jesus came to save.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:53.350
Jesus came with compassion to do
something about it, and he has called

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.420
each one of us to do that same thing.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.440
But what do we know?

00:26:56.445 --> 00:26:58.030
It's hard to not judge it.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.320
I mean, just raise your hand.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.630
Is it hard not to judge people when
you're walking down the street, when

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.960
you're driving in the car and then
cuts you off and you know that they

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.280
shouldn't be on the road driving?

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.180
How dare they?

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.760
And maybe a couple cuss words come
out of you, but you're not wrong.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.960
You're righteous.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:12.480
It's hard.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.490
But this is why we have
to study God's work.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.520
This God's word is true.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:22.140
God's word reigns over our lives and
it helps us remember our condition.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:22.940
Right?

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.670
So making judgments, this is where
it's kind of leading to and it's

00:27:25.675 --> 00:27:27.020
been leading to for a long time.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.460
Making judgment really
begins with self-reflection.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.960
This is where we see
verses three and five.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:36.190
Why do you look at the splitter in
your brother's eye, but don't notice

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.560
the beam of wood in your own eye?

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.470
Or how can you say to your brother,
let me take out the splinter of your

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:44.330
own or in your eye, and look, there's
a beam of wood in your own eye.

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:45.850
Practical, practically speaking.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.590
See, I'm this guy that thinks
of things after the fact.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:53.010
I wish I had a beam that I could just hang
out here in my eye, and then attempt to

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.510
try to pull something out of your own eye.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.000
That'd be pretty funny, wouldn't it?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.300
It'd be stupid.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.610
You guys would be like, yeah,
you're trying to help me?

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.010
Um, they'd probably be
like, well, can I help you?

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.700
That's really how Jesus wanted this to be.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:12.590
He wanted it to seem so stupid to think
about as someone in our condition that

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.730
hasn't dealt with our own, that hasn't
seen our own brokenness, hasn't seen our

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.459
need for grace to ever go on a break.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:21.730
And, and to help them overcome
their sin without dealing

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.230
with their own is impractical.

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.810
It's, it is completely impractical.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.950
And why, when we begin to judge
others, do we downplay our own sin?

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:32.580
Why?

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.050
I think a couple of reasons.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:34.960
I kind of wrote down a couple of reasons.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.680
Number one, we think
the best of ourselves.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:42.550
I think most of us view ourselves
better than some of those around us.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:44.560
We kind of have that
self righteous feeling.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:50.000
Okay, number two, I believe that it's
because it's easy to judge someone.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.050
Else's sin than her own.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:56.020
It's easy to walk around and point out
everybody else's fault, but it's sometimes

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.250
harder to see him in our own life.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.610
And if those of you that are married in
this room, you should know that it's,

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.460
it's hard to hear from your spouse
where you're falling short because you

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.890
don't see it and you like to justify it.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.730
The last one is, I think it's this
way, is that it's easy to judge

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.280
sin in other people's lives in
which you don't struggle with.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:15.630
I wanna say that again.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.530
It's easy to judge sin in other people's
lives that you don't struggle with.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.380
I'm just, I'm just telling you it is.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.130
When you think.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.030
I'll just give you a couple of reasons.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:29.170
I can't believe so and so
isn't given to this church.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:29.950
I double tithe.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:34.310
I mean, even if you're double tithing,
praise God, keep doing that, okay?

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:37.450
Um, but, you could be also the
person that says this, I can't

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.980
believe he just used foul language.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.640
I've never said a cuss
word in my life, right?

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.570
That may be one of them.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.080
I can't believe she just
yelled at her kids in church.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:49.620
I'm so calm, I've never
yelled at my kids ever.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.670
My kids are perfect, okay?

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:58.600
We begin to view ourselves quickly as
better than those around us because of...

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:04.860
It's a lot of different reasons, but
making judgments starts with self, right?

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.180
So Jesus mentions this beam
and this splinter, right?

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.660
So when we get to think through this, when
we haven't self reflected and realized

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:17.360
how broken we are, and we have this
beam sized pride or this holier than I

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.680
mentality in our way, we have no ability
to help others, no ability to help others.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:26.310
And when you think about the splinter, I
thought of it this way, anybody ever had

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.740
a splinter in their hand or their finger?

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:29.180
Okay.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.090
Now let me ask this question.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.300
Anybody had a splinter In your
hand, your finger that you couldn't

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.760
see and you had to get magnifying
the glass out, and you're like

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.860
trying to pick around to find this.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.480
I want you to imagine that, and I want
you to imagine a long two by four,

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.030
and I want you to think about this.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:52.880
How in the heck if you have a
long two by four in your eye and

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.450
somebody has a splinter that needs a
magnifying glass, how could you help

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:58.470
them without helping yourself first?

00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:59.190
Is it?

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:00.630
Is it possible?

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.190
Some of you, I know you like,
I'm up for the challenge.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.580
Let's go.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:06.440
It's not Jesus is telling.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.270
And I really even started thinking
through this a little bit more.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:16.360
So when we think about the eye, when
we think about how sensitive the part

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:22.940
of that body is in the eye, um, we need
to think a little bit deeper with this

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:26.620
situation of taking care and helping
other people overcome their sins.

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:29.370
Number one, our eye is sensitive,
meaning anything that gets

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.980
in it needs tender care.

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.330
It needs basically somebody that is
not blinded by a log in their eye.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.570
And I started thinking about
this, I don't think you would

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:38.450
even go to your eye doctor.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.340
And that day your eye doctor had anything
in his eye, not a log, but even if he

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.880
had anything in his eyes that hindered
his seeing, there's no way he would

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.370
help you get something out of your eye.

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:49.020
No way.

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:50.460
He would say, you're crazy.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.460
Let's wait another day until
I get that cleared out.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:58.400
And if, if a doctor, an eye doctor
could practically see that, how can

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.720
those of us that follow Jesus that has
sin in our lives, try to go and make

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:08.700
judgments and accuse people and help
people if we don't help ourselves first.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:09.790
By looking.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:12.640
He's speaking inward at
ourselves and our sin.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.990
And that's exactly what
he's speaking about here.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.990
So there's a couple of take homes I
want to give you right now, and we're

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:22.900
going to continue on, um, and finish
up this, but number one, Christians,

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:28.440
or God honoring people that want to
honor God in how we make judgments, it

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.600
starts with love and compassion, right?

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.640
But then it is the next step, and
this is what we see in verse five.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.380
First five.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.800
This is what he says.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.270
He says, hypocrite.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.020
First, take the beam of
wood out of your own eyes.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.710
Um, and then clearly take the
splinter out of your brother's eye.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:51.020
So as we begin to self reflect, we
prepare ourselves to serve others, right?

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:54.730
Not to judge and condemn, but to help.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.140
And here is what I want us to think about.

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:03.140
And I really want you to genuinely
answer this question because I know some

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.420
of you are going, Oh yeah, praise God.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.920
Do you genuinely want to help
other people come to know Jesus?

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.420
Why don't you just answer
that question in your heart.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.440
I want to ask it again.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:19.110
Do you genuinely want to help other people
come I'm going to ask another question.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.860
Do you genuinely want to help
other believers who are struggling

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.240
with sin overcome their sin
and be freed from their sin?

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:31.950
Do you genuinely want to help
others be freed from their sin?

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.800
That even within the church,
because we all deal with sin.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.660
This is what he's talking
about with helping believers.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:37.840
Do we genuinely want to help them?

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.440
Because if we truly do, if we
truly do, then it starts with us.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.260
It starts with looking in the mirror
and in James 5, er, James chapter 1.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.700
One and actually talks about that we,
there's people who look into the mirror,

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:58.310
the, the word of God, they leave it and
they forget the condition of themselves.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:00.320
They forget the condition of their hearts.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:06.120
So God is calling us to self-reflect,
self-reflect so that we can serve others.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:11.830
And when we don't self-reflect before
we try to serve others and help them

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:16.970
overcome their sin, we can sometimes
do more damage than a speck of dirt

00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:19.970
that's left in their eye if we try to
approach them without dealing with.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:21.769
I'm going to say that again.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:22.960
This is, this is hard to hear.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:28.210
If we go without unrepentance and without
understanding our need for grace first,

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:34.070
when we go to others who are living in
sin, we can do more damage because what

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.090
happens is they begin to look at your
life, they begin to look at what you

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.880
come with and they can't believe you.

00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:41.860
They say, well, the church is judging me.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:47.230
The church has no care for me, the church
and the Christians and we represent Jesus

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.620
and then we begin to set people back and
I know God's sovereignty and so don't get

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:51.790
me if you want to have that conversation.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:52.270
After.

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.380
Okay.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.250
God's sovereign.

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:56.190
He'll save those who he wants
to save if he has to use

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:57.440
somebody else other than you.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.930
But I believe God has called each
one of us to be a part of someone

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:05.500
else's salvation story or repentance
story and coming back to God.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.160
And so I think it's important to know
that we have to start with ourselves.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.980
So the last verse six, I want
to go over this pretty quickly.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.650
This one seems like just
a random verse thrown in.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:20.410
Anybody feel that way when
you read these verses?

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.910
You get the five verses in and
then you just got this random like,

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.960
don't give what is holy to the dogs.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.299
It's awesome.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.880
Well, I don't know much about
pigs or dogs, um, and I don't know

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.560
what pearls he's talking about.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:35.830
Right?

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.620
So those are the things I started
thinking through when I looked at

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:42.000
this, and so I'm just going to try to
summarize this as quickly and as deeply

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.740
as I can to help understand this.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:50.490
When we begin to deal with our own sin,
and then we go in the right way to those

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:55.390
who are dealing with sin, there are some
times that those people will reject help.

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:56.230
They'll reject correction.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:56.910
They'll reject...

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.520
The grace and truth and love
and mercy that you extended.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:04.230
And here's what will happen is those
of us that are really compassionate

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.850
will continue to come back and share
the pearls, the truth of the gospel.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.820
We'll share as much as we
possibly can, but at some point

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.620
we have to leave them to God.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.180
God is the one that changes
the hearts of people.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:22.190
And so he's basically saying don't
continue to go back repeatedly

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.850
if they are rejecting the truth.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.960
Because if you continue to go
back, you, and he says this,

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.510
they will tear you to pieces.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:33.050
And he's really even speaking about
these religious leaders, right?

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:37.490
In that time, as they begin to share these
truths with religious leaders, they would

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.120
tear them up if they continued to go.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.020
And that is a hard thing to hear.

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:44.370
And, and, what I would say is Jesus
isn't giving up on these people.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.510
What Jesus is saying is that.

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:49.760
At times we need to let God do the work.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.050
And so the question is, how do
we know when enough is enough?

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.530
And I think that's the
spirit of God leading me.

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:58.530
But I want to just tell you this,
it's a tough choice to make.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.530
And when I began to study through this,
I began to think, you know, there was a

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.950
time where I didn't listen to this verse.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:09.220
And I began to try to push, and try
to show up, and try to keep sharing.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.320
And I began to be torn down and beat up.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:18.480
And I realized that I was basically
putting myself in a position.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.840
that was not healthy for me.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.390
And that person was not changing.

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:25.920
And I had to step back and
say, Lord, you have to work.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.540
It's no more my turn.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:29.800
It's now yours.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.150
And so this idea is this is the
time where we love the sinner.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:35.650
We don't love the sin in
which they're living in.

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:36.870
And we continue to pray for them.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:39.220
And God gives an opportunity to
show you and be a part of that.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.320
And so that's a tough part of that verse.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:44.060
There's more to it, but
that's a short answer to this.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.400
So I wanted to kind of finish today
just with that kind of summarizing this

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.110
and thinking through this Romans 12.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:49.499
Thank you.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:51.580
Three, I think, summarizes this well.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.590
This is what Paul said.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.230
Paul said, because of the privilege
and authority God has given me.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.400
Here's what Paul says, I give
each of you this warning.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.910
Don't think of you, don't think
you are better than you really are.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.870
Be honest in your evaluation of others.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.250
Measuring yourself by the
faith that God has given you.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.570
So there's four things that I learned
when I was studying this message.

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.260
Um, and that somebody
else had came up with.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.380
So this isn't my idea with it, but
I love, I love how it laid out.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:20.300
And it's basically four H's.

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:22.280
I'm going to talk to you
about how we can have a grace

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:23.460
centered judgment in our lives.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.220
Number one, we need to be
hesitant when we judge others.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:28.480
What does that mean?

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.410
It's the moment that you feel yourself
judging someone in such a way that makes

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:35.320
you righteous and them unrighteous.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.750
We should be hesitant.

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:45.000
We should begin to view our sin
first, look inward, and then

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.030
repent and turn from whatever is
in our lives before we go for it.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:53.000
I would say even this, giving people the
benefit of a doubt, many times we make

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:56.600
judgments So that's the number one thing.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.140
Number two, we need to be humble.

00:38:58.770 --> 00:38:59.530
How do we be humble?

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:02.110
Number one, again, we can't
think of ourselves as better.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.570
We have to lay down our pride.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.110
We have to lay down our self
righteousness as though we're better.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.290
And again, I want to give you
just a couple of examples.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:13.170
If you're wanting to go to a family that
is parenting kids, you believe in an

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:15.340
ungodly way that is not valuable for them.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.590
It is easy for you to think, well, I've
got it right and they've got it wrong.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.810
I'm going to go be the
savior mentality in this.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:28.120
You may need to walk alongside them
because you say, But you also don't

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.190
know the family circumstances.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:33.270
And you also have put yourself in a
position that is probably unhealthy.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:36.370
And understand that you
have some issues as well.

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:38.930
There's, there's more to that, so
I'm just giving you an example here.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.110
The number one, or number
three, is to be honest.

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:45.130
Right, so we have to be hesitant,
to be humble, and then to be honest.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:49.110
Right, to be honest means to
make a commitment to God's Word.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.970
If, if we don't go to God's Word
when it comes to making judgments,

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.170
we start letting the flesh speak.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.320
We think we know better.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.060
And so we can We need to go to the
Word of God and we need to humbly

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.470
submit ourselves to God, not our
flesh, in approaching someone.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:07.570
And number four is, what I love about
this, is to be holistic, meaning

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:11.400
that our goal is, in this judgment,
is restoration, not condemnation.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.820
In the end, God will judge everyone.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.860
It's restoration, not condemnation,
which means that we desire for people

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:23.930
to turn back to God, to repent of their
sins, and our goal is to not shove it

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:28.450
in their face and to make them feel
like this horrible person in the world.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.120
It's really...

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.540
Just to sit beside them and say,
I know what you're going through,

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.460
because I deal with sin as well.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.990
I deal with brokenness.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:35.890
I deal with struggle.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.610
I'm not perfect, but Jesus is,
and he is the way, the truth

00:40:39.615 --> 00:40:42.130
in life, and he can help us.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:46.390
So my hope and prayer with this is that
those of you that have had somebody

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:50.810
say, don't judge me, because the Bible
says don't judge me, maybe you do need

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:55.880
to do some self-reflection and ask the
question, did you judge in an ungodly way?

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.560
And if you did and you
remember that person's name, I.

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:05.310
I encourage you to go back to that person
and humbly submit and say, I am so sorry.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.590
I was wrong in how I judged you.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.880
But then be able to share with
them, my heart in this is because

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.910
I want something better for you.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:17.510
I want you to experience Jesus.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:18.980
I want you to overcome your sin.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.330
You know, that, that is my hope is
that we've learned that those of you

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:27.110
that have been judged in the past,
maybe you've been hurt by a Christian

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.430
that has done it in a wrong way.

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:29.430
Number one, I'm sorry.

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:33.980
But number two, I think today is a way to
see that I think ultimately every person.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:41.380
Um, and so my hope is that maybe in the
midst of that you can see some truths

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.710
that maybe God will reveal in him and
that you can learn to forgive them for it.
