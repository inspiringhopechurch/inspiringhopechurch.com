00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.950
I know that, uh, everybody's probably
ready to jump into their activities

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.440
that they have going on this weekend.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.650
I know we have several people that are
traveling out this weekend and as they're

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.940
texting me that they're gonna be gone.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.060
I'm like, I envy you a little bit,
cuz some people are on the beach.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.410
Some people are with family.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.630
Uh, but I know some of
you guys have some plans.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.150
I know we do as well tomorrow,
so I'm excited to go do that.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.280
So, um, excited to be here with you
guys today, um, to be able to jump

00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:34.019
into God's word, we're gonna be in
first Peter today, um, in chapter one.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.500
And so if you guys wanna go ahead and
turn there first Peter chapter one, we'll

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:39.090
also have it up on the screen as well.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.129
so you guys can see it.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.940
We're probably gonna end up going through
about verse 16, uh, going through this

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.500
pretty quick, but, um, we just got done
finishing a couple weeks ago, walking

00:00:49.504 --> 00:00:50.849
through the book of first Timothy.

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:53.610
And so we're gonna take some time to
just jump into some different texts

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.269
over the next several Mo uh, several
weeks before we jump into a new series.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.599
And this is actually interesting,
uh, one that, uh, me and

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:01.500
Noah walked through a little.

00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:05.914
As he was preparing to walk through
with, um, Ashton for a little bit.

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:09.035
Um, and then also as I was going
back over just studying this

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:11.225
week, um, this popped back up.

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:13.865
And so it's those moments where you
go, okay, God, are you speaking to me?

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:17.675
And today I believe that's what God was
doing is he was setting up today as a

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:21.965
day for, um, that all of us, something
that we need to, to, to see in this.

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:27.275
And so, um, what we're gonna be
talking about is this idea behind hope.

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:32.570
Fully, uh, and it's kind of bringing
this word hopefully, uh, and breaking

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.199
it apart and looking at how we can
have hope fully, not partially.

00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:37.490
So let me ask this question.

00:01:37.494 --> 00:01:38.630
I love asking questions.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.509
How many of yous have said this?

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.190
I hope so.

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.399
Anybody ever say, like, I hope
so, or like maybe, you know, I,

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.089
I I'm, I think it might happen.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.100
So we're hoping that
something might happen.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.869
And I, let me ask this question.

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.940
Anybody ever felt hopeless at times?

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.119
Like you feel like there's no
way something's gonna work out.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.490
I know those are two things
that I've said before.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.510
I hope so.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.520
So I'm not really sure or I'm hopeless,
which means I am totally even just not,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.870
I don't believe anything's gonna happen.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.130
Well, I believe in this text today
that we can understand that through

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.381
God, we can hope fully in him and
in the work that he wants to do.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.660
In us and through us, that's something
that encourages me is that even in those

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.850
times, whenever I, I wonder what God is
doing, God is working fully through me.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.810
Um, and this really comes from
first Peter chapter one, verse 13.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.820
I wanna read this just before we
read the whole text, but it says

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.390
this in first, Peter, one 13, it
says, therefore, preparing your minds

00:02:38.395 --> 00:02:40.640
for action and being sober mind.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.320
Set your hope fully on the grace
that has been brought to you at

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.000
the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.910
So I know this, um, as a church, as an
individual for you, my desire is for

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.010
all of us to experience Christ fully.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.400
Uh, and I believe the only way that
we'll do that is if we have faith

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.000
fully in Christ fully, uh, alone.

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.240
And so I'm ready to do that and
ready to jump into this text today.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.810
So if you find your place, let's
jump in, we'll read the whole.

00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:13.335
First part of first Peter, up to verse
16, and then we'll, we'll dive in.

00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:18.315
So it says this, it says Peter and
apostle of Jesus Christ to those chosen

00:03:18.315 --> 00:03:24.375
living as exiles dispersed abroad
and Ponti Galatia cap, CAPA decia,

00:03:24.675 --> 00:03:29.775
uh, Asia Bethany chosen according to
the fore knowledge of God, the father

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:34.155
through the sanctity sanctifying work
of the spirit to be obedient and to be

00:03:34.155 --> 00:03:35.955
sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:38.295
May grace and peace be multiplied to.

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:42.135
Blessed be the God and the
father of our Lord Jesus Christ

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.055
because of his great mercy.

00:03:44.234 --> 00:03:47.565
He has given us a new birth
into a living hope through the

00:03:47.565 --> 00:03:51.285
resurrection of Jesus Christ from
the dead and into this inheritance

00:03:51.555 --> 00:03:53.865
that is imperishable and defiled.

00:03:53.865 --> 00:03:56.295
And in fading kept in heaven for you.

00:03:56.745 --> 00:04:00.195
You are being guarded by God's power
through faith for salvation that is

00:04:00.195 --> 00:04:01.725
ready to be revealed in this last.

00:04:02.614 --> 00:04:06.785
You're rejoice in this, even though
now for a short time, if necessary, you

00:04:06.785 --> 00:04:11.015
suffer grief in various trials, so that
your proven character of your faith

00:04:11.045 --> 00:04:16.084
more valuable than gold, which though,
um, though perishable is refined by

00:04:16.084 --> 00:04:19.115
fire may result in praise, glory honor.

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:20.945
At the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:23.094
Though you have not seen him.

00:04:23.094 --> 00:04:24.265
You love him though.

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:27.385
You've not seen, uh,
though you not seen him.

00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:32.784
Now, you believe in him and you rejoice
with inexpressible and glorious joy

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:36.565
because you are receiving the goal of
your faith, the salvation of your souls.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.410
Concerning the salvation, the
prophets who prophesied about

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.980
the grace that would come to you,
searched and carefully investigated.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.120
They inquired into the time of what
circumstances, the spirit of Christ within

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:52.770
them was indicating that he be testified
in advance to the sufferings of Christ

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.270
and to the glory that would follow.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.870
It was revealed to them that
they were not serving themselves,

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.170
but these, but, but you, these
things have now been announced to.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.380
Through those who preach the gospel to you
by the holy spirit sent from heaven angels

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.750
long to catch a glimpse of these things.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.180
Therefore with your
minds ready for action.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.850
Be so reminded, set your hope completely,
or hopefully on the grace to be brought

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.960
to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ
as obedient children do not be conformed

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.250
to the desires of your ignorance, but as
ones who are called as holy, you are to

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.920
be holy in your conduct for it is written.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.720
Be holy because I am.

00:05:34.425 --> 00:05:36.375
Let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:39.765
We just pray Lord that your word,
uh, will not return void today.

00:05:40.065 --> 00:05:42.825
So I pray that as it was read Lord,
that it begins to sink into our heart.

00:05:42.825 --> 00:05:46.275
And as we begin to walk through it and
apply to our life, Lord, I pray that

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.565
you reveal what needs to be, um, added
to our life Lord, and that we'll be

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.465
reminded of what you've done for us
and what you desire to do through us.

00:05:54.465 --> 00:05:55.785
And so we pray this in your heavenly name.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.820
So as we jump into this, I'm gonna be
covering these 16 verses pretty lightly.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.099
There's some things that we're gonna
jump into deeper and some things

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.039
we're not going to, but one of the
things I, I love being able to do

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:09.510
is we're jumping into this book.

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:12.000
Um, the first couple of verses,
a lot of times we can kind

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.380
of just look at, ah, this is.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.630
Peter and I'm writing to these people
and this is where we're at, and this

00:06:17.635 --> 00:06:21.890
is great, but I think it's important
to kind of set this text up and

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.540
actually walk through a couple things.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.900
So, Peter, if most of you would probably
know this, if you have read the Bible

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.940
at all, Peter is one of the apostles.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.100
Um, he was actually the rock, right.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.410
That Jesus was gonna build the church on.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.110
Um, and something that we know about Peter
is that God used Peter despite his broken.

00:06:40.034 --> 00:06:42.765
Anybody ever feel like you're
inadequate to be used for God's glory.

00:06:42.765 --> 00:06:44.655
Like you feel like, Hey God, can't use me.

00:06:45.015 --> 00:06:46.664
I'm not good enough there.

00:06:46.994 --> 00:06:50.085
There's there's just, you know,
something's always wrong with me.

00:06:50.085 --> 00:06:51.614
There's always something
I, I know I can't do.

00:06:51.614 --> 00:06:52.304
I'm not smart.

00:06:52.304 --> 00:06:53.234
I'm not talented.

00:06:53.234 --> 00:06:53.924
I'm confused.

00:06:53.924 --> 00:06:54.674
Whatever it is.

00:06:55.034 --> 00:06:56.354
You wonder, can God use you?

00:06:56.505 --> 00:07:01.575
Well, God used Peter to write
this book and to change people.

00:07:01.575 --> 00:07:05.130
Um, You remember the first
sermon that he preached over 3000

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.210
people get their lives to Christ.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.070
And so God uses broken people.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.320
So if we look at Peter's
life, he questioned Jesus.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.060
Multiple times, he broke promises.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.210
He denied Jesus, and he went
back to his old way of living.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.861
When he was fishing before Jesus gave him
his command to send him off, to use him.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.830
But still God used him.

00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:24.500
So that's just something I sitting here
think is we're jumping into this book.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.830
God uses broken people,
so God can still use us.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.729
So we can hope fully that God
can still use us despite our

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.409
downfalls missing the mark.

00:07:33.739 --> 00:07:34.909
But there was something
else that I'll look to this.

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:38.719
He says, he's talking to the
exiles who are dispersed well,

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:42.260
these exiles, or if you would look
at these are pilgrims as well.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.429
They are outside of their home.

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:43.609
They've.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.359
Basically away from their permanent home.

00:07:46.359 --> 00:07:48.969
And if you wanna look in from a
spiritual standpoint, these exiles

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.729
are actually away from their
permanent home, which is in heaven.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.630
Um, and as you think about that for
us, if we're looking at this today,

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.830
we're all pilgrims, we're all exiles
because our permanent home is in heaven.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.270
And so as we're living that way, we
tend to live in a place that seems

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.080
a little bit uncomfortable, a little
bit out of what we want or we desire,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.940
which is an eternal home with.

00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:12.935
Uh, and because of that, I
think we can relate to who

00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:14.705
Peter's writing to we're exiles.

00:08:15.065 --> 00:08:18.455
But just, if you look at this
specifically, uh, these believers

00:08:18.455 --> 00:08:21.455
were having difficulties and
these difficulties, weren't

00:08:21.455 --> 00:08:24.425
just like, Hey, we're getting
killed or we're getting beat up.

00:08:24.485 --> 00:08:27.784
These difficulties were people just didn't
like the way that these believers were

00:08:27.784 --> 00:08:31.534
living, some of the convictions, they had
some of the beliefs that they had does

00:08:31.534 --> 00:08:35.075
it, does it, does that sound a little bit
familiar to you guys today that it seems

00:08:35.075 --> 00:08:39.750
like at times as believers, as followers
of Jesus, That it seems like we're the

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.090
only ones that can't have an opinion.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.600
The only ones that can't have a belief
that doesn't match up with the worlds.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.360
And so do you know, this is
not me just to knock the world.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.140
This is me to just say at times it's
difficult just to get push back on

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.140
what you believe and what you don't
believe as, as a follower of Christ,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.730
but that's what happens to us.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.860
And so these believers were
dealing with the same things.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.329
So as Peter's writing this to
them, he's writing this to us.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.750
And so what I realized as
I begin to think about.

00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:10.709
Um, and this is why I just wanting to
set up this text is when we get pushback

00:09:10.709 --> 00:09:12.510
on our beliefs, how can we respond?

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.680
There's two ways we can respond.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.980
I was actually talking to somebody the
other day at the gym that I coach at.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.390
And at this gym, they were talking about
somebody that was basically bashing

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.230
them for some of the things that they
believed and they wanted to be angry and

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.150
they wanted to be able to fight back.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.650
And here's what I said.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.939
Well, you could, but then you
would become the person that

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:34.219
they already think you are.

00:09:34.935 --> 00:09:38.145
But what if you responded differently,
what if you responded like Christ did?

00:09:38.175 --> 00:09:39.045
What if you love them?

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:40.125
What if you showed compassion?

00:09:40.335 --> 00:09:41.475
What if you forgave them?

00:09:42.255 --> 00:09:43.275
What do you think that would do?

00:09:43.395 --> 00:09:44.025
Oh, well that would.

00:09:44.655 --> 00:09:46.545
That would probably shut them up because
then they wouldn't have anything.

00:09:46.785 --> 00:09:47.625
Absolutely.

00:09:48.105 --> 00:09:50.565
So that was just something that I
started thinking through here is at

00:09:50.565 --> 00:09:53.625
times as we're being persecuted is
these people were being persecuted.

00:09:53.865 --> 00:09:56.505
As Peter's writing to them, we
have two ways we can respond

00:09:56.655 --> 00:09:57.915
outta love or out of hate.

00:09:58.155 --> 00:10:01.515
And when we respond out of love,
it really shows who Christ is,

00:10:01.845 --> 00:10:02.655
but there was something else.

00:10:02.655 --> 00:10:05.355
And again, I'm just trying to set
this text up as he's writing these

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.305
people, he's writing these people
in all these different areas.

00:10:07.305 --> 00:10:09.645
I'm not gonna reread them because I
probably will pronounce them wrong.

00:10:09.915 --> 00:10:12.765
But all these areas are
in present day Turkey.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.110
It's interesting.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.050
When you look at this, he's writing to all
these believers in present day Turkey, but

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:22.300
if you were to go and look, uh, and look
at research less than 1%, it's probably

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.570
about a half a percent of the people
living in Turkey today are believers.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.560
So in Peter's time, there was
more believers probably there

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.580
than there are currently.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:35.080
That is crazy to think about how something
can have such a gospel presence years

00:10:35.085 --> 00:10:36.490
and years ago and how it can lose it.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.270
What happened?

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.120
What happened?

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.500
It's because people begin to be less
and less passionate about who Jesus

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.770
is less and less passionate about
the message of the gospel going out.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.780
And so I just was challenging myself.

00:10:48.785 --> 00:10:54.810
How do you avoid maybe Hamilton,
Ohio, or wherever you live?

00:10:54.815 --> 00:10:57.190
How do you avoid seeing
whenever you get older?

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.360
Whenever you pass on that this
city does not become darker.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.510
Less like Christ, but it becomes
more like Christ that more

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.410
people come to know Christ.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.910
And I believe there's a
couple of different things.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.270
Number one, as churches,
we need to have unity.

00:11:09.275 --> 00:11:11.189
And the reason why I say that
is whenever this unity happens

00:11:11.195 --> 00:11:11.970
is, you know what happens?

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.740
We don't go outside the doors.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.270
We focus more inside the walls,
so we need to focus more outside.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:18.480
Right?

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.770
That's the other, that
would be the second one.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.260
Number two is that we focus more
of our time talents and treasures

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.300
outside than more on Sunday mornings.

00:11:24.689 --> 00:11:27.060
And the other is by each one
of us owning the mission.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.950
And I know again, we're wondering
where are we going with this

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.030
text, but I wanted to set this up.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.260
This is a people that had a lot of
believers before and does not have a lot.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.699
We don't wanna become that as
a church and as a community.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.370
So we wanna fight against
that by owning the mission.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.490
Each one of us owning the mission
that God has given us to inspire

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:47.819
hope, to challenge people, to know
Jesus and to live out their faith.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.810
Um, and then the last thing that he
talks about here in verse two is he's

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.770
talking about, he says the inverse one,
he says chosen, these people were chosen.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.430
These exiles chosen, according to
God's fore knowledge of God, the

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.939
father through the sanctifying
work of the spirit to be obedient.

00:12:03.705 --> 00:12:05.055
and I wanna start there.

00:12:05.055 --> 00:12:09.975
That's really gonna launch us off into
this message that God has called us

00:12:09.975 --> 00:12:16.095
as exiles pilgrims out of darkness,
out of the world and into the light,

00:12:16.095 --> 00:12:18.944
into be a child of God to be obedient.

00:12:18.944 --> 00:12:21.705
Does, does anybody like, whenever
you think of the word obedience,

00:12:21.705 --> 00:12:23.055
does that sound exciting to you?

00:12:24.465 --> 00:12:25.245
It doesn't.

00:12:26.055 --> 00:12:26.985
It really doesn't.

00:12:26.985 --> 00:12:30.225
And, and here's the reason why most
of us think somebody's trying to tell

00:12:30.225 --> 00:12:32.265
me what to do when I don't wanna do.

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:36.510
but let me just kind of step out
there a little bit to challenge

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.290
you a little bit on that word.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.359
Obedient the word obedience.

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:42.300
Whenever I started thinking about
obedience within my family's life,

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.800
I want my kids to be obedient.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.150
Not because I want them to suffer,
but because I wanna protect them and

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.800
I want them, I want, I wanna love 'em.

00:12:50.219 --> 00:12:54.569
So I'm saying, Hey, don't go outside
and run in the middle of the road.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.050
I want you to obey me
because they disobey me.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.719
You, you go well, that's logical.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.709
what, what about, what about not
touching the hot oven and when

00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:06.240
they do, they burn their hands in.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.470
I just want you to obey me.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.770
Why?

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.930
Cuz I'm trying to protect
you from burning your hand.

00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:11.790
See that's obedience.

00:13:12.089 --> 00:13:12.310
Not.

00:13:12.824 --> 00:13:16.844
Hey, I want to go, you know, do this
fun thing and I'm like, no, obey me.

00:13:16.844 --> 00:13:19.935
That's not what I'm typically saying
when we're talking about OB obedience.

00:13:20.324 --> 00:13:24.734
So when we're looking here and Peter's
writing to people who were called out

00:13:24.739 --> 00:13:29.145
of, uh, uh, out of the darkness into
the light to go be obedient, it's not

00:13:29.145 --> 00:13:31.064
to go do things that, which you hate.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.470
It's to go do things in
which is valuable for you.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.870
God knows what's good for you.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.220
So as your father, your heavenly
father, he is saying, be obedient,

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.880
follow the things that I have for
you, which is better than what

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.620
you could do alone, apart from me.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.980
And the reason why I think this sets
up this text is because if we don't

00:13:49.985 --> 00:13:54.330
see that God has called us to be
obedient, everything that follows.

00:13:55.245 --> 00:13:58.935
Doesn't mean anything to us, but it
means so much to us when we see this.

00:13:59.295 --> 00:14:03.765
So let's kind of jump into starting at
verse three, Peter shares, how we should

00:14:03.765 --> 00:14:07.305
live as obedient followers of Jesus.

00:14:07.545 --> 00:14:09.555
The first one in verse
is three through five.

00:14:09.555 --> 00:14:11.595
He talks about how we should live.

00:14:12.245 --> 00:14:18.525
Hope fully, not somewhat with hope
or occasionally or every once in

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:21.225
a while, but fully, completely.

00:14:21.405 --> 00:14:24.375
And so he says here blessed be
the godfather of our Lord Jesus

00:14:24.375 --> 00:14:26.625
Christ because of his great mercy.

00:14:26.745 --> 00:14:31.125
He has given us a new birth into a
living hope through the resurrection

00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:32.475
of Jesus Christ from the dead.

00:14:33.074 --> 00:14:36.855
One of the things I'm challenged with
this, when we look at this word living.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.620
it's it's logical, but I want us to
think a little bit differently with this.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:46.290
He says a living hope, not a dead
one, a living hope, not a tired one,

00:14:46.295 --> 00:14:51.630
exhausted one, a slow hope, an occasional
hope, but a living active hope.

00:14:52.199 --> 00:14:55.890
So when I think about a living, hope
anybody ever seen those kids, that just

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.380
seem like that they had energy all day.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.020
Laura has a few, um, but a just
great example there, but it's those

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.550
kids that just don't run out of.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.260
What I would say is those
kids are living, right.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:13.110
They seem to always just have energy.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.420
And here's what typically happens.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.550
People will say, I wish
I had their energy.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.480
Do you know, sometimes let's go
back to this spiritual example.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:27.900
There's sometimes I'm seeing people who
are so sold out for Jesus and I see them

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.620
living hope fully, and I'm going, man.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.220
I wish I had that.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:33.719
Man.

00:15:33.719 --> 00:15:35.790
I wish I had that.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.719
Well, this is what Peter's telling us is
because of what Jesus has done for us.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.189
We can experience.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.380
We can experience the living hope that
he gives us where we can have that

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.120
energy, but how do we experience it?

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.470
That's always the hard part.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.439
How do we experience it is by
reminding ourselves of these

00:15:52.439 --> 00:15:56.100
truths, by reading the word of God,
why do we read the word of God?

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.620
The word of God reminds
us of God's truths.

00:15:58.829 --> 00:16:01.949
And the more that we think on something,
the more that we live something.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.430
And I'm just challenging myself in
this idea that the more that we think

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.360
on something, the more that we become
that, right, the more that we live.

00:16:10.439 --> 00:16:13.949
so a living hope has life in it, right?

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.650
Here's the one thing that's hard thinking
about whenever it comes to a living hope

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.079
with Jesus, it gets better over time.

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:20.310
I want you to think through this.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.219
It's just like, to me, I believe
marriage gets better over time.

00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:25.500
The more that I know my wife,
the more that I love her.

00:16:26.295 --> 00:16:27.735
See, I believe a relationship with Christ.

00:16:27.735 --> 00:16:31.035
The more that you spend time with them,
the more that you experience who Jesus

00:16:31.035 --> 00:16:33.015
is, the closer that you get to him.

00:16:33.195 --> 00:16:35.835
Even the older you get in age,
the closer you get to spend an

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.605
eternity with him, it gets better.

00:16:37.845 --> 00:16:40.305
But let me give you the exact opposite.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.515
If you don't have a hope in Jesus,
which means you don't have a hope

00:16:43.515 --> 00:16:46.185
after this life, the older you get.

00:16:46.935 --> 00:16:49.755
the more that life fades away from
you, what you're trying to cling

00:16:49.755 --> 00:16:51.795
onto, and you're losing hope.

00:16:51.795 --> 00:16:56.565
You become hopeless because less time on
the earth and less money that you have

00:16:56.565 --> 00:17:03.075
and less time to experience this life,
you become hopeless apart from Christ.

00:17:03.675 --> 00:17:07.635
So when we see this living hope it is
something that we get to experience

00:17:07.875 --> 00:17:10.665
completely now and in eternity.

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:14.505
And that's something that gives us
hope as we continue to look at this.

00:17:15.435 --> 00:17:17.744
But for some, you know, you
experience this at a young age.

00:17:17.744 --> 00:17:19.425
I know some people that have
given their life right before

00:17:19.425 --> 00:17:20.594
they passed away as well.

00:17:20.685 --> 00:17:23.774
And I there's a couple of people that I've
actually heard these stories where they

00:17:23.774 --> 00:17:25.665
gave their life right before they died.

00:17:25.814 --> 00:17:26.834
Here's what they said.

00:17:27.074 --> 00:17:28.635
I wished I would've done it sooner.

00:17:28.995 --> 00:17:29.504
Why?

00:17:29.925 --> 00:17:33.854
Because they would've got to experience
a living hope their whole life, rather

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:38.745
than just an eternity with God, their
whole life, they missed out on that

00:17:38.745 --> 00:17:41.425
living hope throughout their whole life.

00:17:42.345 --> 00:17:44.835
One of the things that I love
is that we don't have to wait

00:17:44.985 --> 00:17:46.305
till heaven to receive it.

00:17:46.455 --> 00:17:50.775
And this is where we see in verse
four, where it says, um, that

00:17:50.775 --> 00:17:51.825
we receive this living hope.

00:17:51.825 --> 00:17:55.665
And then in verse four, it says an into
an inheritance that is imperishable

00:17:55.905 --> 00:18:01.095
undefiled unfading kept in heaven
for you and inheritance anybody ever

00:18:01.095 --> 00:18:03.405
been given an inheritance, anybody.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.740
Nope.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.310
Nope.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.190
I've known some people that's been
given inheritance and sometimes the

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.920
inheritance they get is a load of cash.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.490
Sometimes it's a house and sometimes
it's just a nice little watch.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:14.850
Okay.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.510
But an inheritance is usually something
given to you when someone passes away.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.420
Well, again, let's look at what Jesus did.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.360
Jesus died and rose again.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.860
Jesus gave us his
inheritance eternal life.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:33.870
Now not only in eternity and
that challenges me guys, that

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.360
we get to experience Jesus.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:42.390
Now the hope now, and in eternity,
we don't have to wait at all,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.030
but this inheritance is so
important for us to look at.

00:18:45.035 --> 00:18:49.230
He says, this inheritance we get
from a living hope is imperishable,

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.790
which means it never goes away.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.010
It's undefiled, which means it's perfect.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.300
It's unfading which.

00:18:54.595 --> 00:18:57.835
Always new and it's kept in
heaven where it can never be lost.

00:18:57.835 --> 00:19:01.285
I'm gonna say that again, this
living hope is imperishable.

00:19:01.285 --> 00:19:05.725
It will never, ever, ever
go away ever, ever, ever.

00:19:06.385 --> 00:19:06.655
It is.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.825
Unfiled and perfect.

00:19:07.825 --> 00:19:08.665
I'll tell you this.

00:19:08.935 --> 00:19:11.965
Every single time we just got a house that
was just got done, built, being built.

00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:13.275
The moment.

00:19:13.275 --> 00:19:15.025
It was perfect was the
moment it was finished.

00:19:15.345 --> 00:19:18.075
And the moment we stepped foot
in it, it is not perfect anymore.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.855
There's more deans in this house than we
had before because we move stuff in and

00:19:21.855 --> 00:19:25.905
it kind of frustrates me, but then it
reminds me, there's nothing, this side of

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.635
heaven that is perfect outside of Jesus.

00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:31.695
So this living hope
that we have is perfect.

00:19:31.845 --> 00:19:34.665
And it's unfading meaning
that it's always new.

00:19:34.665 --> 00:19:35.385
It'll never wear.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.840
And it's kept where to never be lost
because I'll, here's, I'm just, I'm gonna

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.820
lean in more into this example, guys.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.680
Do you know how many times in the
last three days, since we moved

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.160
in this house, I couldn't find
what, what I had packed anywhere.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.490
It was lost with the living hope.

00:19:51.435 --> 00:19:52.304
Is never lost.

00:19:52.485 --> 00:19:54.044
It's always found in Jesus.

00:19:54.135 --> 00:19:57.405
It's always present no matter where you're
at, no matter what you're going through.

00:19:57.735 --> 00:19:59.145
So that encourages me.

00:19:59.385 --> 00:20:03.854
And then he says in verse five, he
says, you are being guarded by God's

00:20:03.854 --> 00:20:06.104
power through faith for salvation.

00:20:06.104 --> 00:20:07.995
That is ready to be
revealed at the last time.

00:20:08.235 --> 00:20:11.774
So no matter what happens this
side of heaven, God will guard this

00:20:11.774 --> 00:20:14.145
inheritance for you with his power.

00:20:15.344 --> 00:20:16.205
Start thinking about.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:17.879
Today's society.

00:20:17.879 --> 00:20:20.879
We're talking about inflation and we're
talking about the stock market going down.

00:20:20.879 --> 00:20:24.510
That may not be you, but I'm living in
the world where that matters, because

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.659
it seems like I'm paying more money
for gas than I've ever paid in my life.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:34.860
But if I put my hope in the government
or in my financial advisor to

00:20:34.929 --> 00:20:41.760
protect or to keep my inheritance
right now, they're failing majorly.

00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:44.580
So I'm thankful I don't have
to do that with my eternity.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.330
Because my eternity is kept
in heaven with God's power.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.300
So I don't have to worry about
having confidence in anything else

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:56.010
other than Jesus, but Jesus gives us
the confidence and the freedom and

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.900
inspiration to go live fully for him.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:01.650
And for the sake of others, the challenge
that I want to ask you is we begin to

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:02.730
continue to go through this message.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.380
What is holding you back?

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.730
What is holding you back from
experiencing the life that God has

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.450
called you to God wants you to live.

00:21:13.755 --> 00:21:17.985
he wants you to experience hope
fully, but too many times we

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:19.695
wake up, we wake up defeated.

00:21:19.935 --> 00:21:20.535
I've been there.

00:21:21.015 --> 00:21:22.365
We wake up discouraged.

00:21:22.395 --> 00:21:23.145
I've been there.

00:21:23.205 --> 00:21:23.895
I get it.

00:21:24.615 --> 00:21:31.455
But God desires today to give you the
hope fully that he desires for us to be

00:21:31.455 --> 00:21:33.285
able to experience his call in our life.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.700
and to change others' lives.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.990
So let's go into the second point, right?

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:41.430
So Peter shares how we should live
our life's hope fully in verses three

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.830
through five, but here's another
thing he kind of goes on a little

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:48.720
bit, step further to live our lives,
hope fully, why while we're suffering.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:53.880
And this is in verses six and seven,
six says this, it says you rejoicing.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:59.429
This living hope even though for a
short time, if necessary, you suffer

00:21:59.429 --> 00:22:03.810
grief in various trials so that your
proven character of your faith more

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.139
valuable than gold, which is through
perishable is refined by fire may

00:22:07.139 --> 00:22:11.909
result in the praise, honor glory at
the, at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.490
Do you ever wonder why bad things happen?

00:22:15.699 --> 00:22:16.189
Anybody?

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.260
All the time, all the time.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.720
I ask those questions all the time.

00:22:22.185 --> 00:22:24.135
Not only what, why is this
happening in the world?

00:22:24.615 --> 00:22:27.135
But typically, because I'm a
very selfish person, I ask this

00:22:27.135 --> 00:22:28.845
question, why is it happening to me?

00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:29.805
Why me?

00:22:30.435 --> 00:22:31.065
Why not?

00:22:31.065 --> 00:22:33.135
So, and so he doesn't love Jesus.

00:22:33.315 --> 00:22:34.455
I don't like him.

00:22:34.905 --> 00:22:37.875
I mean, anyways, I'm not that person.

00:22:37.875 --> 00:22:38.355
Yes I am.

00:22:38.355 --> 00:22:41.205
But you know, we typically
ask these questions.

00:22:41.205 --> 00:22:42.185
Why do these things happen?

00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:43.155
right.

00:22:43.575 --> 00:22:49.635
But Paul is reminding us this, despite
these things happening, we can rejoice

00:22:49.635 --> 00:22:52.986
in what the living hope that we've
received, even though we've experienced.

00:22:54.179 --> 00:22:55.320
Hard trials.

00:22:55.889 --> 00:23:00.480
This is the, the thing I wanna say
is as a Christian or as a believer,

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.699
every one of us experiences trial.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.600
What's the difference.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.830
You wanna know what the difference is
that I have a living hope in Jesus,

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.070
despite my circumstances, because
no matter what I lose this side of

00:23:11.074 --> 00:23:13.020
heaven, I'll never lose my salvation.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.820
I'll never lose my eternity with God.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:20.085
Then Harrison said he gave me, but,
but if you're an unbeliever, And you

00:23:20.085 --> 00:23:23.775
don't have living hope and you lose
everything here, you lose your money,

00:23:23.775 --> 00:23:27.315
you lose your job, you lose your life,
whatever it is, you have nothing.

00:23:27.795 --> 00:23:31.455
And that's not me being like, I'm just
trying to say the reality is as believers,

00:23:31.455 --> 00:23:33.825
we have something to celebrate that.

00:23:33.825 --> 00:23:37.605
Even though we have suffering, we
can experience this hope that God

00:23:37.605 --> 00:23:40.335
gives us fully how he gives us.

00:23:40.335 --> 00:23:40.755
Right.

00:23:42.095 --> 00:23:45.735
Despite our circumstances,
God still is good.

00:23:46.335 --> 00:23:51.480
So if we truly believe that we have
faith, Fully in God, we can truly

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.860
understand that God will continue to
build us up and use us for his glory.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.030
And so here, let me just
challenge you with this

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.830
statement in the midst of trials.

00:23:58.835 --> 00:24:05.370
Typically we ask why, why, well, God is
doing something in you and through you.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:10.380
And I wanna share this verse, Luke
1247 says this from everyone who has

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.870
been given much, much will be required.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.600
And from the one who has been
entrusted with much, even

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.920
much more will be expected.

00:24:17.925 --> 00:24:21.765
As we've experienced a living
hope as we've experienced hope

00:24:21.765 --> 00:24:25.005
fully, God has given that to us.

00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:27.915
And the more that he gives that to
us, the more that he expects of us.

00:24:28.785 --> 00:24:31.275
Well, what do you mean will trials?

00:24:31.695 --> 00:24:34.215
Actually produce something in us.

00:24:34.425 --> 00:24:36.405
It challenges us and grows us.

00:24:36.915 --> 00:24:40.755
And so some of the greatest trials that
I have every week are physical trials.

00:24:40.755 --> 00:24:44.415
Again, I work at a gym and I help
coach and typically work out.

00:24:44.655 --> 00:24:47.985
And what happens in the midst of that
workout, my body is going through a

00:24:47.985 --> 00:24:53.475
trial, but what happens whenever that
trial's over, I begin to get stronger.

00:24:55.035 --> 00:24:55.935
And you say what?

00:24:56.415 --> 00:24:58.965
This trial's meant for me to get stronger.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:00.750
In my faith.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.250
Yes, absolutely.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.730
And it says this in James, this is verse
seven, kind of even talks more about this.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.450
What's the purpose of our trials, James,
uh, chapter one versus two through

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.400
four says, consider it a great joy.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.790
My brothers and sisters, whenever you
experience various trials, because you

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.810
know that the testing of your faith
produces endurance and let endurance

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:23.340
have its full effect so that you may
be mature and complete lacking nothing.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:28.740
So our trials and our faithfulness
will produce something in us and will

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:33.450
make us better, stronger, and able to
give praise and glory to God because

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.310
we were faithful and did not give up.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.820
Here's the another thing that I want,
I want, I've thought about this.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:43.140
When I go through a trial, there's someone
waiting for me on the other side of that

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.090
trial for me to help them get through it.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:49.920
What, what if your trial is, uh, an
ability to minister to somebody else?

00:25:51.915 --> 00:25:55.004
Or what, if your trials, an ability
for the church to minister to you?

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:58.814
Sometimes we don't
realize the big picture.

00:25:59.054 --> 00:26:00.584
Our perspectives are limited.

00:26:01.635 --> 00:26:05.505
Issues struggle, depression,
financial issues, marriage issues.

00:26:05.625 --> 00:26:06.915
They're right in front of us.

00:26:07.095 --> 00:26:09.615
And we say, oh, what are you doing Lord?

00:26:09.975 --> 00:26:11.955
And the Lord says, but
my perspective's here.

00:26:12.225 --> 00:26:16.065
And I see that that trial will produce
something in you and will change

00:26:16.065 --> 00:26:21.765
those around you, depending upon your
faithfulness and your hope fullness in me.

00:26:22.725 --> 00:26:28.545
See, I can preach that, but at times
I struggle to believe that why?

00:26:29.325 --> 00:26:30.525
Because it's difficult.

00:26:31.514 --> 00:26:32.445
It's tough.

00:26:33.284 --> 00:26:34.365
So what do we do?

00:26:34.965 --> 00:26:36.345
We continue to lean on one.

00:26:36.375 --> 00:26:37.125
That's why we're here today.

00:26:37.125 --> 00:26:38.115
I don't know why you're here.

00:26:38.595 --> 00:26:42.645
I'm here because I need you guys and,
and I hope that you need me and I

00:26:42.649 --> 00:26:45.585
hope we need each other because we're
here to build one another up and

00:26:45.585 --> 00:26:48.735
to remind ourselves of these truths
so that we can leave outta here.

00:26:48.855 --> 00:26:53.325
More hopeful that we can
completely understand God and

00:26:53.325 --> 00:26:54.975
who he is and what he is doing.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.620
So our stories of faithfulness can
change the lives of those around us.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.100
I want you to, to remember that, and
this is one of my statements I've been

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.360
cling to over the last couple months.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.320
God's faithfulness in the past
gives me confidence of his

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.060
faithfulness now and in the future.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.639
So if you've struggled at times to
wonder if God is faithful, thank there's

00:27:14.639 --> 00:27:16.230
some moments where God has shown up.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.990
And when he has shown up clinged
those cuz there's gonna be some times

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.629
where you wonder what God's doing
and you'll be half to confidence.

00:27:22.545 --> 00:27:25.425
What he's done in the past to
help you in the, in the future.

00:27:26.385 --> 00:27:28.845
So our trials have a purpose, just life.

00:27:29.595 --> 00:27:33.855
It does for athletes who suffer
during training, but it's for a

00:27:33.855 --> 00:27:37.185
greater purpose so that they can
win the prize of a championship.

00:27:37.995 --> 00:27:41.565
So the same thing for us as we
suffer it's to win the prize

00:27:41.835 --> 00:27:43.815
of honor and glory for God.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.320
and the benefit of us and others.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.590
So Peter shares how we should
live, hopefully how we should

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.720
live, hopefully while suffering.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:55.050
And then how he, he says this in verses
eight through 12, and I'm gonna run

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:59.130
through this pretty quickly, but he
says how we can live hopefully now.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.430
So if you look at verse eight, that
says, though, you have not seen him.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.040
Speaking of Jesus, you love him though.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:05.880
Not seeing him.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:10.890
Now you believe in him and you rejoice
with inexpressible, glorious joy.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.350
See, I think at times we.

00:28:14.895 --> 00:28:18.764
May go back to, to maybe what I've
said, or I think I may have said this

00:28:18.764 --> 00:28:24.435
to our core team earlier, but it's
this idea behind we are looking for

00:28:24.435 --> 00:28:29.145
something to be excited about and we
don't experience what God has for us now.

00:28:29.565 --> 00:28:31.784
So again, you probably
have been here before.

00:28:31.784 --> 00:28:34.425
You've, you've been to college
and you're like, man, whenever

00:28:34.425 --> 00:28:37.665
I get my degree, whenever I get
married, when I make that right.

00:28:38.945 --> 00:28:42.225
Whenever I have this many kids, well,
my kids grew up to this age, whatever

00:28:42.225 --> 00:28:45.015
it is that you may be thinking,
you're kind of pursuing for that.

00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:46.275
That's gonna give you happiness.

00:28:46.425 --> 00:28:47.745
Here's let me give you something.

00:28:47.895 --> 00:28:49.005
You're gonna get there.

00:28:50.025 --> 00:28:52.485
And it's gonna be a little bit further
and you're gonna get there and you're

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.795
gonna need a little bit more money you're
gonna get there and that education's

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.785
not gonna be what you thought it was.

00:28:55.935 --> 00:28:59.385
You're gonna get there and it's
still gonna be the same, you and

00:28:59.535 --> 00:29:01.755
Jesus, and a lot of trials at times.

00:29:02.775 --> 00:29:03.585
So stop.

00:29:05.265 --> 00:29:08.055
Looking for, and let me just
challenge you on this stop.

00:29:08.055 --> 00:29:10.455
Just waiting for heaven, man.

00:29:10.455 --> 00:29:11.385
I can't wait to get to heaven.

00:29:11.385 --> 00:29:14.895
Here's thing I wanna get to heaven too,
but right now we can experience heaven.

00:29:15.165 --> 00:29:17.715
Jesus lives inside every single
person that's given their life to

00:29:17.715 --> 00:29:20.055
him and we can experience hope now.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:21.899
And an eternity with God.

00:29:22.439 --> 00:29:23.639
Don't miss that.

00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:24.629
That's what he's saying here.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.889
Why, why is he saying here?

00:29:25.889 --> 00:29:28.590
He kind of walks through this
quickly, but even though again,

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.030
we can't see Jesus physically.

00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:34.230
We love him and we trust him by
faith and we are receiving the

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:37.800
goal of our faith by receiving the
salvation of our souls right now.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:38.550
Right.

00:29:38.554 --> 00:29:41.610
This is our inheritance, but
versus 10 through 12, talk about

00:29:41.615 --> 00:29:44.550
the profits, which if you go to
the old Testament, the profits,

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:47.340
we're prophesying about everything
that we're experiencing right now.

00:29:47.985 --> 00:29:51.495
They were prophesying about this,
realizing that what they were prophesying

00:29:51.495 --> 00:29:55.785
about, they wouldn't experience, but we
would, but then it goes on at the end of

00:29:55.785 --> 00:29:57.975
verse 12, and it talks about the angels.

00:29:58.065 --> 00:29:58.635
And I love this.

00:29:58.635 --> 00:30:01.635
It says the angels long to
catch a glimpse of these things.

00:30:01.875 --> 00:30:05.955
Even the angels wanna see what
God is doing by living in our

00:30:05.955 --> 00:30:09.795
lives and using us and to have a
personal relationship with him.

00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:12.795
So the prophets and the angels
are a little bit envious of us.

00:30:12.825 --> 00:30:13.905
That's really what it's saying.

00:30:14.955 --> 00:30:16.155
So think about this.

00:30:16.649 --> 00:30:20.190
The group before that's planning, you
know, help being a part of the plan

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:25.139
of God's plan that's happening right
now, wanted to see what was happening.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:30.629
And so sometimes again, I'm just telling
you, at times I catch myself peering

00:30:30.629 --> 00:30:34.230
into the future, hoping for something in
the future when I should be hopeful now.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.230
There is something we're celebrating.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:37.470
Now.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:38.820
God is doing the work in our lives.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.410
Now he wants to change your lives.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:41.550
Now he wants to use you.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:41.760
Now.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.450
He wants you to know him, his
peace and his hope and all

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:47.340
the joy that he gives now.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.560
But you may be a lot like me.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:51.720
You probably are a lot like me.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:56.250
We wonder how the heck
can we experience it now?

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:56.700
Right.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.620
I, I think at times it's like, you
want that, but it's always fleeting.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.090
You never can grab hold of.

00:31:04.409 --> 00:31:06.690
So I I've been reading
Ecclesiastes lately.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.990
And if anybody's familiar with
that, he talks a lot about that.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.710
Grasping after some things that
we think will fulfill us is like

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:17.010
grasping at the air every time
we think we have it, it's gone.

00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:21.870
So at times what's happening is we
want this relationship with Jesus.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.190
We wanna be all in.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:28.680
We wanna be hope fully, but we're
grasping at worldly things that

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.790
will never fulfill us when only
thing that can fill us is Jesus.

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.260
Jesus his presence in our lives.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.830
His hope that he gives us grace and
mercy, he forgives us of our sins.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:46.140
He, he forgives us forever messing up,
cuz it seems like I'm always messing up.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:51.180
And he says, despite what I've done,
just like Peter, I will use you.

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.960
That's what Peter was trying
to tell these people, Hey,

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.220
you're in the middle of trials.

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:57.300
Don't give up.

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:01.020
I mean experience the
hope, the living hope.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.880
Now don't miss it.

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:05.280
Don't wait until you're
not exiles anymore.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.530
Don't wait until maybe you
get to go back to your home.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:09.990
Don't wait, experience it now.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:14.340
So as believers and unbelievers,
it's easy to get distracted from

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.060
experience the hope fully now, but
God has extended that to us today.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.420
It is now the, the last thing
that he talks about here, and

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.530
this is verses 13 through.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.629
As he challenges us to
live, hopefully focused.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.070
This is that distraction piece.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.149
I was kind of talking about here.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:35.610
So he says this in verse 13, therefore
with your minds ready for action, be

00:32:35.615 --> 00:32:41.100
sober minded and set your hope completely
or fully on the grace to be brought to

00:32:41.105 --> 00:32:43.500
you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:32:45.179 --> 00:32:49.980
We have received this living hope
to live fully for the Lord in his.

00:32:51.465 --> 00:32:55.695
And he talks about this word focus
and, and guys, I I'm the person

00:32:55.695 --> 00:32:57.015
that thinks I can multitask.

00:32:57.015 --> 00:32:59.415
You ever studied about
that when you multitask?

00:32:59.415 --> 00:33:01.515
You're actually not
really accomplishing more.

00:33:01.755 --> 00:33:05.295
You're you're just more distracted,
but I like to multitask because I

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.865
think it just seems to fulfill me, but
he says to focus, to have our minds

00:33:08.865 --> 00:33:11.655
ready and clear with no distractions.

00:33:12.285 --> 00:33:13.695
And I, I think of no distractions.

00:33:13.695 --> 00:33:15.045
Anybody ever watched a horse race?

00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:15.735
Anybody?

00:33:16.875 --> 00:33:18.765
What, what do the horses
have on their eyes?

00:33:19.815 --> 00:33:20.325
Why.

00:33:22.575 --> 00:33:23.475
Keeps them focused.

00:33:24.165 --> 00:33:27.645
They don't get distracted guys at times.

00:33:27.645 --> 00:33:29.504
This is, this is what I
believe Jesus is saying.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:30.915
I believe this is what Paul's saying.

00:33:31.395 --> 00:33:38.774
Hey, y'all, it's a crazy world
out there and it's difficult, but

00:33:38.814 --> 00:33:41.054
Jesus has given you a live in hope.

00:33:41.745 --> 00:33:45.794
Put on your blinders, focus in on me.

00:33:46.335 --> 00:33:47.655
Get your minds ready.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:55.350
Set your hope completely on me, the
grace that I gave you, it's a challenge.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:58.740
It's difficult, but he's
challenging us to do this.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:01.980
And when we do, then he challenges
as this, it comes back to verse

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.560
14, which pushes back to verse two.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:08.820
And he says this as obedient
children do not be conformed to

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.469
the desires of former or ignorance.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.929
Those blinders are there for you to
not go back and try to grasp the wind.

00:34:16.709 --> 00:34:19.229
which is grass worldly, things
that you think will fulfill you.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:25.290
He says, don't go back to that because
if you do, it's hopeless, but if you

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:29.489
put on your blinders, if you focus,
if you set your minds on the grace

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:34.109
and the mercy that I brought to you,
this living hope you will be obedient.

00:34:34.114 --> 00:34:38.429
You will be following after
the, the plans that he has for.

00:34:39.735 --> 00:34:43.395
The plan's not just for you, but for
those around you to change the lives

00:34:43.395 --> 00:34:46.935
of those around you at inspiring hope,
we challenge people to discover their

00:34:46.935 --> 00:34:48.765
purpose through a relationship with Jesus.

00:34:48.825 --> 00:34:53.715
We believe every person has a purpose
through a relationship with Jesus.

00:34:53.805 --> 00:34:56.445
And the more that we pursue Jesus,
the more that he reveals that.

00:34:57.285 --> 00:34:59.475
So basically with these
verse, I'm gonna reverse 16.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.835
I'm gonna kind of summarize this
up, but in verses 15 and 16, he

00:35:02.835 --> 00:35:05.205
says, but as one who is holy.

00:35:06.075 --> 00:35:09.615
You are also to be holding your conduct
for it is written behold because

00:35:09.615 --> 00:35:11.055
I'm holy and wholly only means set.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.470
Right set apart for the work of God.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:17.100
So basically what Peter is saying
here is don't let your past hold you

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.970
back from experience the future that
God has for you to change the world.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.960
The writer of this letter, Peter would
totally understand this statement.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:29.970
I love when the Bible is written by
people who are not writing out of no

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:32.520
experience, but complete experience.

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:35.730
When somebody gives me advice, I
don't want somebody to give me advice,

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:37.380
advice based upon what they read in a.

00:35:38.475 --> 00:35:40.575
. I want them to give me advice
based upon what they've lived.

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:42.345
That's the type of mentors I want.

00:35:42.555 --> 00:35:44.085
And that's the type of
people I wanna read after.

00:35:44.085 --> 00:35:47.835
Well, Peter Deni, Jesus, you guys
remember us talking about that?

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.335
At the beginning, he denied Jesus.

00:35:49.455 --> 00:35:54.705
He went back fishing again, back to
his old ways and it wasn't fulfilling.

00:35:55.215 --> 00:35:56.775
He wasn't really catching any fish either.

00:35:56.775 --> 00:36:01.095
Let's look what happened
in John 21, 15 through 19.

00:36:01.545 --> 00:36:04.995
So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus
asked Simon and this is after Jesus

00:36:04.995 --> 00:36:06.315
came out, hollered at him to come.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:10.980
He was, they came in from the boat
and he decided to cook them breakfast.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.740
But he says when they had eaten
breakfast, Jesus asked Simon

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:18.270
Peter's son, uh Simon's son of John,
do you love me more than these?

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:20.279
And Peter says, yes, Lord.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.160
You know that I love you.

00:36:23.549 --> 00:36:25.200
And Jesus said, feed my lambs.

00:36:26.129 --> 00:36:29.129
And the second time he asked them,
Simon son, John, do you love me?

00:36:29.669 --> 00:36:30.270
Yes, Lord.

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.520
He said to him, you know that I love you.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.480
He said, shepherd, my.

00:36:35.085 --> 00:36:36.225
he asked him a third time.

00:36:36.225 --> 00:36:37.065
Simon's son.

00:36:37.065 --> 00:36:38.085
John, do you love me?

00:36:38.595 --> 00:36:39.585
And Peter was greed.

00:36:39.585 --> 00:36:42.075
When he asked him a third
time, do you love me?

00:36:42.285 --> 00:36:45.135
He said, Lord, you know everything,
you know that I love you.

00:36:45.585 --> 00:36:46.245
Feed my sheep.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.925
Jesus said to him, truly.

00:36:47.925 --> 00:36:49.815
I tell you when you were
younger, you were tied.

00:36:49.815 --> 00:36:53.325
Your, you tied your bell and walked
wherever you wanted, but you grow alt.

00:36:53.325 --> 00:36:56.265
When you grow old, you will stretch out
your hands and someone else will tie you

00:36:56.265 --> 00:36:57.735
and carry you where you don't want to go.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.290
He said this to indicate what kind
of death Peter would glorify God.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.660
And after saying this,
he told him to follow me.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.700
Why do I bring this example up?

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:10.110
Peter is someone who messed up.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.810
He's someone who was not perfect.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.440
He's someone who you and me
may relate with really well

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:18.330
and wondering can God use me?

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.980
And despite Peter's background,
Jesus still pursued Peter.

00:37:23.009 --> 00:37:25.230
Even when he did go back.

00:37:25.755 --> 00:37:27.105
To his way of living before.

00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:29.565
And here's what Jesus
is saying to us today.

00:37:31.365 --> 00:37:32.055
Come back.

00:37:33.615 --> 00:37:35.145
And he's gonna challenge
you with this statement.

00:37:35.145 --> 00:37:35.805
Do you love me?

00:37:36.975 --> 00:37:39.765
And the question you may say
is I've given my life to Jesus.

00:37:39.885 --> 00:37:40.635
Yes, Jesus.

00:37:40.635 --> 00:37:41.205
I love you.

00:37:42.525 --> 00:37:43.665
And you're gonna kind of be like, okay.

00:37:43.935 --> 00:37:45.735
And then Jesus is gonna
say again, do you love me?

00:37:46.185 --> 00:37:46.965
And you're gonna go well.

00:37:46.965 --> 00:37:47.745
Yes, yes.

00:37:47.835 --> 00:37:48.315
I love you.

00:37:48.315 --> 00:37:50.775
I gave my life to you maybe 10
years ago or 20 years ago or

00:37:50.775 --> 00:37:52.335
five years ago or yesterday.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:53.310
Yes.

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:53.970
I love you Lord.

00:37:53.975 --> 00:37:56.640
And he may say it one more time,
which may kind of make you frustrated.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:57.600
Do you love me?

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:04.140
And the reason why he's saying this is
he's saying this, are you sure that you

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.830
love me, that you're ready and willing
to experience the plan I have for you?

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:08.910
And Peter said yes.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.150
And you may say yes, and
here's what Jesus is gonna say.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.920
It's gonna take obedience.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:19.050
And that obedience may be where in your
previous time it was easy, but in your

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.910
future time for Peter, it was difficult.

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.850
Peter lived a difficult life
with other trials and he

00:38:23.855 --> 00:38:25.440
ended up dying for his faith.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:28.740
Jesus may not call you to die for
your faith, but he's gonna say

00:38:28.745 --> 00:38:32.040
this, the path forward may get
difficult, but he says, follow me.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:32.670
Why?

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.360
Because our inheritance, our living hope.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.890
We can receive now.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:42.630
And in the future, it is kept by
God's power and it is something that

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:45.150
God desires you to experience now.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:49.650
And I, I, I wanna, I wanna kind
of finish up this way guys, every

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:55.140
day that we wake up feeling over
overly burdened by our faith is the

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.850
moment that the enemy's creeped in.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:00.240
And he's trying to fool
you that you're not enough.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:02.610
But here's what God is saying.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.860
You now can live freely for him
because you have your blinders on you.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:13.590
Minds are focused on him, the hope
fully that he has given you, Peter

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:18.780
shared straight from his experience
to us on how we can follow and live

00:39:18.785 --> 00:39:23.430
after God fully, even while we're
suffering, even now, not just waiting

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.800
for eternity, but focused on Jesus.

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:27.540
So I wanna end with this is we have in.

00:39:28.185 --> 00:39:30.765
I guess I really wanna
challenge you with this.

00:39:31.455 --> 00:39:36.315
What is holding you back from living the
life that Jesus has called you to live?

00:39:37.395 --> 00:39:39.105
Peter was writing this letter.

00:39:39.855 --> 00:39:42.975
He's writing this to people
who were struggling in their

00:39:42.975 --> 00:39:44.325
faith because they were exile.

00:39:45.225 --> 00:39:47.325
He was reminding them
in their living hope.

00:39:47.745 --> 00:39:51.105
He was reminding them despite their
circumstances that God can still use them.

00:39:51.105 --> 00:39:53.895
God wants to change them
for them to be obedient.

00:39:54.105 --> 00:39:55.785
What is it that's holding you.

00:39:56.955 --> 00:40:00.765
because I I'm telling you, we need
to wake up every day asking this

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:05.145
question, who is waiting on me on
the other side of my obedience.

00:40:06.194 --> 00:40:07.484
And we understand obedience.

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:08.325
Isn't a bad thing.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:10.575
It's a good thing because it's
right where God wants you.

00:40:10.694 --> 00:40:12.345
It's the best for your life.

00:40:13.185 --> 00:40:16.214
And it's the best for God's plans
for other people around you.

00:40:16.395 --> 00:40:17.085
Who is it?

00:40:17.085 --> 00:40:19.455
That's waiting for you on the
other side of your obedience.

00:40:19.634 --> 00:40:20.535
There's somebody.

00:40:20.775 --> 00:40:22.815
So what is holding you back?

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:24.420
During invitation.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.440
I love invitation.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:25.859
Why?

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.279
Because for most of us, it's the only
two to three minutes of the week.

00:40:29.279 --> 00:40:33.359
It seems like we get time to
just sit by ourselves and just

00:40:33.365 --> 00:40:35.129
think and say, Lord, what is it?

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:40.050
So here's my challenge here in invitation,
Lord, this is what you asked Lord.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:45.450
What is it that I need to remove
from my life, change in my life

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:50.670
to fulfill the life that you
call me to, to live hope fully.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:54.400
And I challenge you to
get really honest guys.

00:40:55.575 --> 00:40:57.315
Nothing that you can come up with.

00:40:57.315 --> 00:41:01.155
Jesus is surprised by because Jesus
knows every thought that you have.

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:04.095
So when you begin to think
through, what's holding you back,

00:41:04.095 --> 00:41:05.745
you know it, and he knows it.

00:41:05.985 --> 00:41:07.275
So confess it to him.

00:41:07.875 --> 00:41:08.985
You know what the Bible talks about.

00:41:08.985 --> 00:41:13.545
If we will confess our sins, which
sins are not God's best for you,

00:41:13.995 --> 00:41:17.685
if you'll confess your sins and
repent of them and turn from them

00:41:18.135 --> 00:41:20.355
that he will quickly forgive you.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:23.520
Those things will remove some
of the burdens in your life.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.830
That's preventing you from
experiencing what God's called you

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:28.620
to that sin needs to be repented of.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.270
And today you can do that.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.810
Here's something that I'm challenged
by that I could be preaching today

00:41:34.259 --> 00:41:35.730
to someone who doesn't know Jesus.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:39.359
And if you don't know Jesus, and
you're sitting here saying, I want,

00:41:39.359 --> 00:41:42.900
hope I wanna be full of who God is.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.549
I wanna experience what
God's called me to.

00:41:44.549 --> 00:41:49.049
I wanna experience a life
with hope and peace and joy.

00:41:49.799 --> 00:41:51.359
Then it's through a
relationship with Jesus.

00:41:52.379 --> 00:41:55.680
If you want to give your life to
Jesus, I would love to talk with you.

00:41:55.859 --> 00:41:59.009
My challenge every week is for you to
come and talk to me in the back during

00:41:59.009 --> 00:42:02.669
an invitation after service, I would
love to pray with you, talk to you

00:42:02.669 --> 00:42:06.209
more about how to give your life to
Jesus, because that is where it starts.

00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:09.180
We can't get our lifes right
before we come to Jesus.

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.819
We come to Jesus at Jesus
makes our life, right.

00:42:11.939 --> 00:42:12.359
Amen.

00:42:13.439 --> 00:42:14.520
So I'm gonna pray for us.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:16.589
So during this time of
invitation, just challenge you.

00:42:17.714 --> 00:42:21.134
To ask the Lord, what's holding you
back from experience in life that Jesus

00:42:21.134 --> 00:42:23.055
has called you to live and experience.

00:42:23.415 --> 00:42:26.835
And for those of you who don't
know Jesus, don't let another day

00:42:26.835 --> 00:42:28.694
go by because it's not promised.

00:42:28.904 --> 00:42:31.095
Don't let another day go by
before you answer that question.

00:42:31.095 --> 00:42:31.935
Do I know Jesus?

00:42:32.205 --> 00:42:36.345
And if you don't come talk to me, I'd
love to share with you how to know Jesus.

00:42:36.525 --> 00:42:38.025
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:42:38.025 --> 00:42:38.685
We love you.

00:42:39.735 --> 00:42:42.674
And we're so thankful Lord for your word.

00:42:44.504 --> 00:42:47.565
And for the men and women, Lord
that have gone before us to pave the

00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:52.424
way of, um, how to live our lives.

00:42:53.055 --> 00:42:55.995
And Lord Peter has taught us today
from his experience that you can

00:42:55.995 --> 00:43:01.995
use broken people in exiled places
because you've given every one of them.

00:43:01.995 --> 00:43:06.555
And every one of us, a living hope
that is secured for us in eternity

00:43:07.515 --> 00:43:10.964
and is an inheritance that is
given to us now to experience.

00:43:12.345 --> 00:43:18.915
To experience hope fully, not partially,
not hope so we're not hopeless.

00:43:19.395 --> 00:43:19.634
Lord.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:25.995
We are hope full in you
because God, you are good.

00:43:26.895 --> 00:43:30.975
You sent your son Jesus so that
we could experienced that hope.

00:43:31.845 --> 00:43:35.805
And because of your sacrifice
of sending your son, Jesus Lord,

00:43:36.585 --> 00:43:37.694
let us not leave here today.

00:43:37.694 --> 00:43:38.535
Before we receive.

00:43:39.975 --> 00:43:41.265
And live in Lord.

00:43:41.265 --> 00:43:42.315
What you've called us to live.

00:43:42.375 --> 00:43:42.555
Lord.

00:43:42.555 --> 00:43:45.105
I pray for every person in this room,
Lord, for their hearts to be open

00:43:45.105 --> 00:43:48.605
Lord, as they pray and seek you,
Lord, I pray that you reveal to them.

00:43:48.975 --> 00:43:50.774
What's holding them back
from living the life.

00:43:50.779 --> 00:43:51.495
Lord, you called them.

00:43:52.185 --> 00:43:55.095
Lord, may they take a step of
obedience by repenting up their sins

00:43:55.815 --> 00:43:58.964
by taking a step of faith and saying
yes to you in an area of their life.

00:43:59.234 --> 00:44:02.294
And then Lord, I challenge them
Lord to tell someone so that

00:44:02.294 --> 00:44:03.225
they can be held accountable.

00:44:04.245 --> 00:44:06.015
Lord, if there's someone in
this room that doesn't know you,

00:44:06.015 --> 00:44:07.544
please, Lord, we're begging.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:08.970
Break their hearts.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:13.080
Lord, draw them to you.

00:44:15.029 --> 00:44:15.149
Lord.

00:44:15.149 --> 00:44:16.919
Don't let them leave today
before they get their lives to

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:26.430
you.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.913
So Lord, we spread this in your, a name.

00:44:26.913 --> 00:44:26.915
Amen.
