00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.290
Today, we are starting a new
series, um, in first Timothy.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.420
And when we get done with first
Timothy, we're gonna move on

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.590
to second Timothy as well.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.040
But, um, we like walking
through books, the Bible.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.650
And again, if you haven't been here
a long time or if this your first

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.390
time, um, you may not know how exactly
we do that, but we love being able

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.410
to walk through books of the Bible.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.060
And here's the greatest reason why is,
as a pastor, it challenges me, which

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.260
means I can't skip over verses that are
difficult to address or to talk about.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.350
Um, and so for us as a church,
it says same way, right?

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.970
We want to walk through books of the Bible
to be challenged on everything that we

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.610
read and to learn what God has for us.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.460
And so typically whenever
I start a new book.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.100
I want to be able to kind of catch
everybody up on where we are and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.550
basically the setting and who's,
who's writing this and who's he

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.630
writing to and things like that.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.860
So I'm gonna start off this way.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.960
Um, so the book of first Timothy
was wrote by the apostle Paul.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.390
And so I know some of you
know, who the apostle Paul is.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.740
And so I'm going to ask this question.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.420
What do you know about Paul?

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.590
What do you know about Paul?

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.620
On the road to Damascus.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.950
Yup.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.700
Yup.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.180
Yeah.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.020
Saw Jesus.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.220
Yeah,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.100
There you go.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.260
You pretty much summer
summarized it there.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.590
You know, one of the things I think.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.664
Jesus as well.

00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:43.815
And so Peter or Paul was the last one
to see Jesus, obviously on the road

00:01:43.815 --> 00:01:46.215
of Damascus, after his resurrection.

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:47.445
Um, and so.

00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:51.955
Yes, the apostle Paul wrote many
of the books of the new Testament.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:55.645
And so as we begin to look at
Paul, Paul was also a missionary.

00:01:56.065 --> 00:02:00.955
He, uh, went around to different places,
preach the gospel, stayed for awhile,

00:02:00.985 --> 00:02:05.845
built up, um, a group of followers and
he would leave and he would begin to

00:02:05.845 --> 00:02:07.675
write letters back to these people.

00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:11.755
And a lot of times back to the leaders of
the church, um, and these became churches.

00:02:11.755 --> 00:02:12.775
And so really Paul was the.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.260
Missionary church planner,
um, that we know of.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.149
And, um, so today he's writing
in this book to Timothy right

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:23.370
now, it's the first Timothy, but
it's the first letter to Timothy.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.179
Um, and it says this in the first couple
of verses that the Timothy was the truth.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.710
And the faith.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.470
And so really Paul had saw Timothy.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.160
And so this is the second part of
the character as his true son, see

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.030
Timothy most believe was saved during
one of Paul's missionary journeys.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.010
And it was after he was saved.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.640
He grew in his faith by his grandmother
and his mother who invested in him.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.750
And Paul began to see how he had grown
in his face so much that he invited

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.490
him on missionary journeys with him.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.710
And so Timothy learned
from Paul so much, so that.

00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:56.775
Uh, placed him in this
leadership position here.

00:02:57.105 --> 00:03:01.155
Um, and really Timothy is actually
over the church of emphasis

00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:02.655
known as the pastor of emphasis.

00:03:02.655 --> 00:03:05.415
And so if you were here, when we
were in the book of Ephesians,

00:03:05.715 --> 00:03:09.405
that obviously is the place in
which Timothy was the pastor of.

00:03:09.405 --> 00:03:10.635
And so that's where we
had these characters.

00:03:10.635 --> 00:03:13.245
So we have Paul who's writing to
Timothy as true son in the faith.

00:03:13.545 --> 00:03:17.235
And he's writing to him, um, to talk
about a couple of different things.

00:03:17.235 --> 00:03:19.425
And so first Timothy
three 15 tells us this.

00:03:19.425 --> 00:03:20.655
It says I have written.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.980
And this is Paul saying
to Timothy I've written.

00:03:35.774 --> 00:03:39.255
Just set up how it's leadership
is built up and called to put in

00:03:39.255 --> 00:03:40.845
place and how the church should act.

00:03:41.204 --> 00:03:43.424
But a second thing that we'll learn
and we'll learn it even beginning

00:03:43.424 --> 00:03:45.975
in these first couple of verses
that we'll read today through the

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:50.204
first 11 verses is that Paul was
writing Timothy to confront false.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.800
False teaching.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.710
And so today we're going to talk
about how we should teach the truth.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.160
And it's interesting in a church
setting the greatest way to

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.030
teach the truth that starts.

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:04.755
Obviously I'm in the church, but it also
us as believers, as we're talking to other

00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:06.405
people, we're wanting to teach the truth.

00:04:06.644 --> 00:04:09.315
Um, and there's going to be reasons why
we talk a little bit more about that.

00:04:09.704 --> 00:04:12.765
Um, and so there were teachers
in this church, um, of emphasis

00:04:12.765 --> 00:04:14.805
that were not teaching the
truth, they were false teachers.

00:04:15.105 --> 00:04:17.714
And here's a couple of things that
throughout the book that we'll learn

00:04:18.105 --> 00:04:19.695
that they were teaching incorrectly.

00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:23.625
One is some of these false
teachers were teaching incorrect

00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:24.555
assumptions about the wall.

00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:26.025
They were teaching works rather than.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.920
Um, some of them were teaching
that you shouldn't get married.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.900
Um, and some of us may agree to that.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.680
My wife's done in here.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.160
I love her.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.220
I should definitely get married, but
it was teaching not to get married

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.930
and not to eat certain kinds of food.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.320
And again, we'll get into more of that
later on something we'll learn today, they

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.870
were promoting theories, um, over truth,
which was leading to arrogance conflict.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.690
Um, and basically leading people
to turn away from their faith.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.979
And so obviously that's a critical
issue in the church that he was

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.219
writing to Timothy about, and
he needed him to address that.

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.479
Um, interestingly enough, whenever
I started thinking about false.

00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:06.075
I started thinking about, we are
approached with that all around

00:05:06.075 --> 00:05:09.915
us, in our world and our own
city, um, in our day-to-day lives.

00:05:10.155 --> 00:05:11.955
And we'll, we'll get to talk a
little bit more about that, but I

00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:12.945
wanted to mention something to you.

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:16.575
That's reminded me, um, since we've been
here for almost now two years, and as

00:05:16.575 --> 00:05:19.215
I've got to know people, we went door
to door, meeting, different people.

00:05:19.515 --> 00:05:22.365
One of the things that I've learned
at least locally in Hamilton

00:05:22.365 --> 00:05:23.565
is what I would call spiritual.

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.685
Um, and, and the only reason why I say
it's called spiritual confusion is there,

00:05:27.685 --> 00:05:30.594
if you really look around, Hamilton's
got a lot of churches, a lot of different

00:05:30.594 --> 00:05:32.125
denominations, a lot of different beliefs.

00:05:32.455 --> 00:05:36.265
And as you begin to have conversations,
a lot of times people view, whenever you

00:05:36.265 --> 00:05:40.674
talk to them about your church view you
or your church through the last church

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.474
experience, they had negative or positive.

00:05:42.924 --> 00:05:45.325
And so a lot of times we're
breaking down barriers, right?

00:05:45.325 --> 00:05:45.984
We're trying to figure out.

00:05:46.785 --> 00:05:49.965
What they came out or what they
believe in and where, where they come.

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:53.355
And, and it's important for us to
know the truth so that we can come

00:05:53.355 --> 00:05:55.455
to an agreement on what truth is.

00:05:55.815 --> 00:05:58.005
Um, and so we're going to learn a
little bit more about that as well.

00:05:58.005 --> 00:06:01.635
And so this first challenge as
we jump into this text is that.

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.530
Um, we need to learn how
to teach the truth, right?

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.770
And first Timothy is going to teach us
how to teach the truth and correct false

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.169
teachings and more and more things.

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.060
And so we're going to jump
into this text again, first

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.550
Timothy chapter one, verse one.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.260
We're gonna have the verses
up here on the screen.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.620
Um, so, um, if you guys want
to turn to that, you can.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.210
And so here's what it says.

00:07:39.575 --> 00:07:41.675
Let's pray before we jump
into this Lord, Jesus.

00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:46.715
Um, we're just asking that you use
this word today to teach us to help

00:07:46.715 --> 00:07:51.245
us know what your word has to say and
how we can apply it to our lives Lord.

00:07:51.815 --> 00:07:52.625
And so we pray this.

00:07:55.295 --> 00:07:59.435
So the first thing we see here in
these first four verses is a charge

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:04.445
from Paul and this is a charge or
a challenge to Timothy directly.

00:08:04.445 --> 00:08:06.335
And one of the things that I
realized that the front of this.

00:08:07.215 --> 00:08:11.715
How can Timothy received this charge
from Paul and actually believe

00:08:11.895 --> 00:08:13.515
like this is valuable information.

00:08:13.515 --> 00:08:17.594
Will we see this in the first two verses
again, one, we see that Paul is listed in

00:08:17.594 --> 00:08:19.155
the first verse as an apostle of Christ.

00:08:19.155 --> 00:08:19.664
Jesus.

00:08:20.265 --> 00:08:22.724
The other is that
Timothy was his true son.

00:08:22.724 --> 00:08:25.005
I already kind of mentioned this
a bit earlier, but it was easy for

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:28.605
Timothy to receive a charge or a
challenge to go live his faith out

00:08:28.605 --> 00:08:33.135
in a certain way to lead this church
because of his relationship with Paul.

00:08:33.855 --> 00:08:35.534
I don't know about you
guys, but I tend to.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.159
Timothy has a pastor is
dealing with false teaching.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.720
He's dealing with how
do I set up leadership?

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.329
And so he's welcoming this letter letter.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.829
And I remember this as early,
especially early on, um, with our

00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:56.390
kids and things, my sister and my
brother-in-law, the doctor and a nurse.

00:08:56.449 --> 00:08:58.459
Every single time we were
sick or the kids were sick.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:59.390
We made a phone call to them.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.200
Because they had knowledge.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.780
We didn't have, they had something
to be able to speak into, Hey,

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:04.850
you, you need to go to the doctor.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.000
Hey, you may need this medication.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.600
No, you're good.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.960
Right.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.430
And so we all seek wisdom from
people that we respect and value,

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.680
and that's exactly why Timothy
was able to receive this charge.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.090
And here's the reason why I bring this up.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.910
I think most of you probably are like me.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.480
We don't like being told
what to do or how to do some.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.449
'cause, we're kind of like, I want
to do what I want to do, where I want

00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:29.930
to believe what I want to believe,
but those we respect when they speak.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:30.410
We listen.

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:34.760
So my encouragement for you is
we are getting, um, a chart.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.020
Just like Timothy is from Paul.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.190
Who's respected, who knew
Jesus and followed after God.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.150
And so some of the things we may deal
with in this text is difficult, but it's

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.890
good for us because we trust the source.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.230
We trust the understanding
that the heart of this is good.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.840
And so that's exactly
what Timothy did, right?

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.410
So Paul's first charge to Timothy
was, and sometimes we would miss

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.240
this, his first charge in verse three.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.250
It says, I urge you, um, as I urged
you, when I was in Macedonia remain in.

00:10:03.695 --> 00:10:07.895
So why would it be difficult for
a pastor to remain an emphasis?

00:10:07.925 --> 00:10:08.885
The pastor of the church?

00:10:09.905 --> 00:10:11.555
Does anybody here like conflict?

00:10:11.975 --> 00:10:12.455
Anybody?

00:10:13.325 --> 00:10:14.495
I mean, some of you probably really do.

00:10:14.495 --> 00:10:14.825
I don't know.

00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:16.955
Maybe that's you, we don't like conflict.

00:10:16.955 --> 00:10:21.035
We don't like having to deal with
disagreements and people who are

00:10:21.035 --> 00:10:24.335
believing or teaching or, and so
we would rather just run, Hey, is

00:10:24.335 --> 00:10:26.045
there another place I can go pass?

00:10:26.045 --> 00:10:28.385
There's another place
that I can go do my job.

00:10:29.315 --> 00:10:30.125
Well, this is what.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.750
Paul saying, this is the second
time as I urge you in Macedonia.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.240
I'm urging you again, stay in emphasis.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.490
Don't give up don't back down.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.830
Um, and I think we can relate to that.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.760
And it was interesting.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.270
Some of the reasons to that Timothy
May be struggling with this is one

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.770
first Timothy four 12 tells us this.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.700
It says Paul was told or told
Timothy not to let anyone despise

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.230
his youth, but to set an example for
all the believers in speech and in

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.910
conduct and in love and impurity.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.100
And so we realized that
Timothy was young enough.

00:11:00.195 --> 00:11:04.605
And so those of you who may be young in
your faith, and maybe just not confident

00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:05.925
you can relate with what Timothy, right.

00:11:06.075 --> 00:11:07.275
He may want to move on.

00:11:07.275 --> 00:11:09.645
And for us, we may want to move
on whenever we're challenged

00:11:09.645 --> 00:11:10.725
to step up and step out.

00:11:11.685 --> 00:11:14.625
But what Paul seen is
don't give up, don't leave.

00:11:15.165 --> 00:11:18.165
I'm going to give you some
encouragement, stay faithful.

00:11:18.555 --> 00:11:19.575
This is valuable.

00:11:19.635 --> 00:11:20.835
Don't give up.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.750
This challenge that I have for
you, so remain in emphasis.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.530
And so sometimes we need someone to
give us a good charge or someone to

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.650
give us an encouragement, to remain
where we are to stay faithful.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.660
Maybe it's in your marriage,
maybe it's in your job.

00:11:33.689 --> 00:11:34.890
Maybe it's in your home.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.480
I don't know, whatever difficult issue.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.980
Maybe somebody needs an encouragement
today to stay the course that

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.449
God's presence is with you.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.990
And that if you'll address it, if you'll
work through it, that there'll be good.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.050
On the other side of this, the
second charge we see that comes from.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.550
As to address false teaching
to address false teaching.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.520
So Timothy again is instructed
to address certain people

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.780
not to teach false doctrine.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.120
And again, we already mentioned some
of the ones listed above, right.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.160
And incorrect assumptions about the law.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.510
Works-based salvation.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.210
Again, no one should get married,
promoting green theories over truth.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.770
Um, and even we'll see this in verse four,
following myths and endless genealogies.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.620
And so the one we'll specifically deal
with today in this text will be how.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.410
They were trying to teach people about
the law to go back to works rather than

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.619
the grace and mercy of God through Jesus.

00:12:24.979 --> 00:12:27.890
They wanted them to begin to work
for their salvation, which means if

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.489
you do all these great things and you
fall all this list of rules and meet

00:12:31.489 --> 00:12:33.770
this, then you're holy you're perfect.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.520
You're saved.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.619
And so Paul is saying no, no, no, no.

00:12:36.619 --> 00:12:39.319
Like that was fulfilled through Jesus.

00:12:39.349 --> 00:12:39.920
He fulfilled the.

00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:43.560
Which means those things aren't
honest now, now will desire to

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.319
do certain things, but those are
not what makes us right with God.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:47.910
Jesus makes us right with God.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.490
So that's really specifically
what Timothy is addressing here.

00:12:51.329 --> 00:12:54.630
And so there's some, a negative
outcomes that happens whenever

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.490
we talk about false teaching.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.890
But I want to talk about just
how does that work today?

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:03.360
So what are some false teachings
that you've heard in today's society?

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.329
What are some things that we have
dealt with maybe in our society

00:13:06.329 --> 00:13:07.890
of what false teaching there is a.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:12.949
Anything you can think of.

00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:18.589
Yeah.

00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:25.160
Yep.

00:13:28.089 --> 00:13:29.260
Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:29.439 --> 00:13:29.650
Right.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:32.709
It goes back to being, trying to be
perfect or trying to hit a certain

00:13:32.709 --> 00:13:34.540
standard to get right with Jesus.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.050
That's good.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:35.349
What's another.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.250
All roads lead to heaven.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.329
Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:44.910
What else?

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.839
Anything else you can think of?

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.750
Prosperity gospel.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.050
Right.

00:13:54.439 --> 00:13:56.630
So explain that what's
prosperity gospel mean?

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:05.290
Right.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:06.160
Absolutely.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.700
So the here's what ends up
happening with false teaching.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.710
And so, so we can all get
on the same page with this.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.770
A lot of times with false teaching
it's teaching half-truths.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.850
So part of it is usually good or right.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:19.960
In idea.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.810
But then when you begin to look
at it even further, you begin to

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.600
find that there's nowhere in the
Bible that affirms those beliefs.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.310
And that's where we talk about how.

00:14:28.635 --> 00:14:30.255
We teach truth.

00:14:30.345 --> 00:14:35.805
Well, we don't teach it from
our conviction or what we think.

00:14:35.805 --> 00:14:38.595
We teach it from the word of God and
we go, and we find an, a see if the

00:14:38.595 --> 00:14:40.215
word of God affirms those things.

00:14:41.439 --> 00:14:44.230
So there's a negative outcome
to these false teachings.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.540
We see this in Timothy and
we also see this in our life.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.819
It says this in verse four, it says, um,
it says, you know, not to teach false

00:14:51.819 --> 00:14:56.410
doctrine or to pay attention to miss and
endless genealogies, these promote empty

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:01.900
speculations rather than God's plan, which
operates by faith is distracting people

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:07.510
away from Jesus and putting the focus
on whatever the other thing is, works.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.090
Goodness, positive thinking.

00:15:10.814 --> 00:15:14.115
You know, all these things that
are apart from God's grace.

00:15:14.115 --> 00:15:15.675
So they take us away from that, right.

00:15:15.675 --> 00:15:20.324
And forming theories rather than
evidence trying to place really ourselves

00:15:20.324 --> 00:15:22.425
back in position of control of that.

00:15:23.145 --> 00:15:24.285
I started thinking about this.

00:15:24.795 --> 00:15:30.165
Anybody ever see disputes over false
information on social media, anybody.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.640
Yes, that happens all the time.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:33.850
Right?

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.140
So we have fact checkers now.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.770
And so I'm not here to deal with
that, but it just made me think

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.840
about this is all over social media.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:45.190
Something will get pushed in, in what ends
up happening is people begin to follow.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.580
Without even truly knowing like
what the background of it is, right?

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.970
Is that even based on true information,
because information can be made up.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.880
I told somebody the other day, they said,
well, well, on the internet, it says this.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.990
And I said, if you have an idea of
something and you want it affirmed,

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.570
you can type it in the internet and
Google, and it'll affirm it for you.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:05.830
It's there.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:11.140
So my point is, is we live in a
society where we're consistently

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.090
being pressured with information.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.280
Now, the question is, how
do we know if it's true?

00:16:16.555 --> 00:16:21.925
How do we know if it's false on a,
what I would say a spiritual level,

00:16:21.925 --> 00:16:27.505
we do have the ability to test it,
to test it and see if it's truth.

00:16:28.465 --> 00:16:33.175
But here's the question who usually
ends up getting caught in following

00:16:33.175 --> 00:16:36.415
after false teaching or false
information, who is it that usually gets.

00:16:43.275 --> 00:16:44.115
You okay.

00:16:44.265 --> 00:16:45.255
Maybe it's all of us.

00:16:45.585 --> 00:16:48.915
So I would say it's probably
those who don't know where to go

00:16:49.245 --> 00:16:51.255
to find out if something's true.

00:16:51.495 --> 00:16:52.665
So great example.

00:16:52.905 --> 00:16:56.775
And again, this isn't necessarily a
spiritual thing, but go back to my sister.

00:16:56.775 --> 00:16:57.345
My brother-in-law.

00:16:57.375 --> 00:16:57.795
Why did I call.

00:16:59.305 --> 00:17:02.305
I didn't go to medical school for
eight years or nursing school for how

00:17:02.305 --> 00:17:04.675
many years I just, I don't even know.

00:17:04.675 --> 00:17:06.925
And if I go to Google again,
I can find whatever I want.

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:08.275
So I'm going to go to a source.

00:17:08.785 --> 00:17:11.785
So I go to them, I go to a source
many times, we don't know what

00:17:11.785 --> 00:17:14.335
source to go to, to test it.

00:17:15.204 --> 00:17:18.775
Um, and so it's usually those who
don't have a space or a place to go.

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:22.255
Um, and so the question then
is how do we avoid this?

00:17:22.255 --> 00:17:23.185
We avoid.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.940
Following these, these false
teachings by testing everything

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.410
we hear against the word of God.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.900
So anything that doesn't stick, ignore it.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:31.740
Don't believe it.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.400
So now let me step out there because
I want you guys to understand why

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.660
we believe that here, anything that
I say as a pastor, anything that

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.800
we speak as a church, if you see
something that does not match the

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.330
word of God, one don't believe it.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.720
Number two, be kind enough
to come and talk to me about

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.920
it or the person about it.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.600
Why I want to say this.

00:17:52.425 --> 00:17:54.675
I want to be held
accountable to that as well.

00:17:54.705 --> 00:17:58.095
I'm not going to challenge you to
live your life, to address false

00:17:58.095 --> 00:18:01.665
teaching and look for truth and
not address our teaching as well.

00:18:02.025 --> 00:18:04.455
I want to be correct along
with the word of God.

00:18:04.905 --> 00:18:07.965
And every week that I get an opportunity
to stand up here, there may be some

00:18:07.965 --> 00:18:11.805
times I say something off the wall
because I'm saying thousands of words.

00:18:12.105 --> 00:18:14.385
And if that happens and you say,
Hey, that doesn't seem like truth.

00:18:14.685 --> 00:18:18.345
Please come talk to me because I'm
not going to be that person that says.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.960
You know, one way here
and another way there.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:26.160
So I want to be held to that same standard
as well, but here's the reason why I bring

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.010
this up is churches are becoming more and
more prominent places for false teaching.

00:18:32.639 --> 00:18:36.420
And the reason why I know this again
is the more conversations I have, their

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.720
reason why most people are not going
to church that used to go to church

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.490
is they will say they're hypocrites.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.410
They're teaching something wrong.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:46.080
They, they, they did this, they did that.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.490
And so we as.

00:18:48.735 --> 00:18:50.745
That's just the stigma on churches, right?

00:18:50.745 --> 00:18:52.635
To, and if you think about a
lot of churches, why do they

00:18:52.635 --> 00:18:54.135
teach false teaching one?

00:18:54.435 --> 00:18:55.635
Because they love a following.

00:18:55.995 --> 00:19:00.215
So if you teach certain things that
people love to agree on, you'll get,

00:19:00.525 --> 00:19:01.695
you'll get grain, a crowd, right.

00:19:01.695 --> 00:19:03.855
Or even a following
another is financial gain.

00:19:03.855 --> 00:19:06.945
You'll see some churches do it so
that they can gain financial gain.

00:19:07.515 --> 00:19:12.345
You'll see other people do it because it's
easier then to actually teach the truths.

00:19:12.465 --> 00:19:16.035
So go back to, none of us raised
our hand about loving to address.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.060
So if we don't address it, if we
don't say anything, then it's easier.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.700
And then now, well there's
people, it's gotta be good.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.240
And we're forgetting that the most
important thing is to teach the truth.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.140
So the other thing I would say, this
is a lot of times false teachers

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.390
don't come out with a sign on
their head, Hey, false teacher.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.820
And I think that's what we want to know.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:36.030
Right.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.670
We would love, again, fact checker.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.790
We all know that the articles that come
out with that we'd love to walk around.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.100
And when somebody says
something that pops up false.

00:19:45.105 --> 00:19:49.035
I mean, we would because that's
easier, but that's not true.

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:53.865
So sometimes when we hear something
we have to go, Hm, is this right?

00:19:54.575 --> 00:19:55.905
I don't know what, where can I work?

00:19:55.905 --> 00:19:58.755
And I say wa one, I'm going to
ask for wise counsel from those.

00:19:58.755 --> 00:20:00.855
I know, but I'm going to be seeking
the word to know this as well.

00:20:00.855 --> 00:20:05.265
So we see here in this as obviously
Timothy was given a charge to address

00:20:05.625 --> 00:20:07.335
these false teachings with truth.

00:20:08.145 --> 00:20:11.475
But I love how Paul
doesn't to say address it.

00:20:11.475 --> 00:20:12.975
And then Timothy has to go figure it out.

00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:17.235
He says this, he says he gave Timothy
a goal to aim for when he addresses it.

00:20:17.235 --> 00:20:20.385
And it says this in verse five,
he says, now the goal of our

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:24.435
instruction or our goal of correction
or our goal of addressing these

00:20:24.435 --> 00:20:27.375
false teachers is this is love.

00:20:27.885 --> 00:20:32.355
That comes from a pure heart, a
good conscience and insincere.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:38.910
So his goal was to correct these
false teachers with love, with love.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:45.150
Now, when I read that, I go, Hey, I
actually see a lot of people, correct?

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.110
False teaching with hate,
with anger, with divisiveness.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:50.940
That's, that's something
I kind of grew up with.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.470
I seen in my life even in recently
is a lot of times we want to address

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.210
something with anger or frustration.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:01.140
Because again, if it's false teaching you,
you want to make sure people know what's.

00:21:02.355 --> 00:21:04.985
And, and I'm not saying
don't waiver on the truth.

00:21:04.995 --> 00:21:06.975
Cause sometimes people want to waiver
on the truth just to make sure we

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:10.665
don't have controversy, but I would
say this as he's speaking about love.

00:21:10.785 --> 00:21:12.855
And when I begin to look
at love, love is affection.

00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:16.365
It's Goodwill, it's benevolence, it's
brotherly love, which means this, you

00:21:16.365 --> 00:21:22.815
address false teaching with the person
with compassion, with compassion.

00:21:23.385 --> 00:21:27.075
So Timothy's goal is love with a pure
heart, a good conscience and a sincere.

00:21:28.169 --> 00:21:30.209
And I think those things are pretty clear.

00:21:30.209 --> 00:21:32.669
When we think about a pure
heart, you don't have a motive.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.209
I'm a good conscience, which means
you've sought the Lord in it.

00:21:36.719 --> 00:21:41.100
And it's sincere faith, knowing that
we have the opportunity to as well

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.459
to, to, to be sometimes in the wrong.

00:21:44.459 --> 00:21:47.730
And that was the other side of it is with
love means you're coming in knowing that

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:51.120
you need to listen to, you need to listen
because maybe there's something wrong in

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.770
your heart as well when it comes to this.

00:21:53.429 --> 00:21:54.929
So he says, why, you know, why.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.280
Should we address it with level
verse six says this, it says some

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.400
have departed from these and turn
aside to fruitless discussion.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.510
So they've departed from love and
have focused on fruitless discussions.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.820
And if you study a little bit
more, what ends up happening is

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:14.730
this false teaching was creating
disunity, anger, pride in the church.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.450
So what Paul was saying
is the gospel, the truth.

00:22:19.665 --> 00:22:20.835
Creates love.

00:22:20.925 --> 00:22:24.825
And the church creates love
in addressing one another.

00:22:25.455 --> 00:22:27.254
And I love how he even says this.

00:22:27.495 --> 00:22:30.045
It's not, he says the instruction is love.

00:22:30.075 --> 00:22:31.095
That comes from pure heart.

00:22:31.095 --> 00:22:35.024
So it's not just the attitude in which you
go into the addressing of false teaching.

00:22:35.055 --> 00:22:38.055
It's what you come out of your
wanting to come out of this with

00:22:38.115 --> 00:22:40.205
love, not just go into it with.

00:22:41.314 --> 00:22:45.034
So I would say this, why does it
sometimes we end up getting to these

00:22:45.034 --> 00:22:49.445
discussions over false teaching or
different beliefs and anger comes out.

00:22:49.985 --> 00:22:53.945
I would say most of the time, people don't
go on with those attention intentions.

00:22:53.945 --> 00:22:54.125
Right.

00:22:54.125 --> 00:22:58.595
They have the right motives, but
somehow it turns into fighting or

00:22:58.595 --> 00:23:00.245
bickering or what I would say, gloves.

00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:00.395
Come on.

00:23:01.425 --> 00:23:02.685
So, let me ask this question to you.

00:23:02.685 --> 00:23:04.875
Why do you think that some of the
discussions that we have when we have

00:23:04.875 --> 00:23:09.015
differences of beliefs and we're talking
about addressing some false information

00:23:09.015 --> 00:23:13.635
or false belief, why do you believe
that fighting or arguing happens happens

00:23:13.635 --> 00:23:17.295
when we address these things pride?

00:23:20.015 --> 00:23:21.005
Anything else you can think of?

00:23:25.785 --> 00:23:26.385
Confusion?

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.480
Anything else you can think of?

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:41.220
I would say many times they don't
go in with a wrong heart, her where

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.190
they going with the wrong heart.

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:45.430
So we look here, he says that they
go with love with a pure heart, a

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.020
good conscience and a sincere faith.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.530
I think many people go in with perceived
love and they don't have a pyramid.

00:23:51.824 --> 00:23:55.514
They are coming in with a wrong
heart of correction, right.

00:23:55.514 --> 00:24:00.675
Wanting to justify themselves rather than
to really get to the truth and the issue.

00:24:00.885 --> 00:24:01.245
Right.

00:24:01.604 --> 00:24:05.205
And I would even say this, sometimes
we address it with anger because we're

00:24:05.205 --> 00:24:07.365
so angered over the false information.

00:24:08.354 --> 00:24:10.665
And two wrongs don't make
a right to angry people.

00:24:10.665 --> 00:24:12.014
Don't make it just doesn't work.

00:24:12.044 --> 00:24:12.405
Right.

00:24:12.824 --> 00:24:14.504
Um, I've found this with, with my.

00:24:15.785 --> 00:24:17.675
That anytime we get an
unheated discussions, cause

00:24:17.685 --> 00:24:18.545
it's not arguments, right?

00:24:18.545 --> 00:24:19.625
It's just heated discussions.

00:24:20.465 --> 00:24:23.585
If both of us go into heated
discussions, we get nowhere.

00:24:25.225 --> 00:24:27.775
But a lot of times, if the one person
is coming with a heated discussion

00:24:27.775 --> 00:24:31.465
and the other person comes in with a
little bit softer tone and yes, the

00:24:31.465 --> 00:24:32.605
other person gets a little bit mad too.

00:24:32.605 --> 00:24:35.965
But then in the end you tend to solve
things, but you don't solve things by

00:24:35.965 --> 00:24:37.885
going in with anger and frustration.

00:24:38.774 --> 00:24:40.455
And it says, basically we're
answering this question.

00:24:40.455 --> 00:24:42.855
How w how did the false
teachers end up where they were?

00:24:42.855 --> 00:24:45.315
How did they end up teaching
the false information?

00:24:45.315 --> 00:24:49.095
Because I would say this sometimes
false teachers don't intend

00:24:49.095 --> 00:24:50.685
to teach false information.

00:24:51.405 --> 00:24:53.445
And this is where Paul talks
about this in verse seven.

00:24:53.445 --> 00:24:57.135
He says they want to be teachers
of the law, although they don't

00:24:57.135 --> 00:24:59.835
understand what they're saying
or what they're insisting on.

00:25:01.004 --> 00:25:03.345
So why would they want to become teachers?

00:25:04.215 --> 00:25:08.145
And this day you look at teachers were
people who stood in front of crowds.

00:25:08.415 --> 00:25:09.495
Maybe they wanted to following.

00:25:10.155 --> 00:25:11.325
Maybe they wanted to be a teacher.

00:25:11.325 --> 00:25:12.525
They wanted to aspire to be a teacher.

00:25:12.525 --> 00:25:16.125
And we're going to talk about this
later on in verses a chapter three

00:25:16.425 --> 00:25:20.115
about how this is not many should
aspire to be elders or teachers.

00:25:20.415 --> 00:25:20.715
Why?

00:25:20.715 --> 00:25:24.045
Because there is a, a
weight that comes with it.

00:25:24.105 --> 00:25:26.205
And so maybe they didn't think about that.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.449
And so it's, it's interesting when
you think about this is that they were

00:25:30.449 --> 00:25:33.149
really, if you think about it just
ignorant and that word sounds bad, but

00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:34.409
ignorance just, they didn't know better.

00:25:34.679 --> 00:25:35.580
They didn't know better.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.459
Um, and so that makes sense, right?

00:25:38.459 --> 00:25:43.350
This explains why, when we hear him
tell us to address these things with

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:51.120
love is we're dressing people who may
just not know their, their, their heart.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.860
They didn't know they
were teaching her wrong.

00:25:52.889 --> 00:25:54.959
They didn't maybe understand
that what they were doing was.

00:25:56.145 --> 00:26:00.725
And here's what I look as is Jesus
says this in, in, in Luke 23, 34

00:26:00.745 --> 00:26:03.854
says father, forgive them for,
they do not know what they do.

00:26:04.334 --> 00:26:07.935
Even Jesus on the cross saw people who
thought they were doing something right by

00:26:07.935 --> 00:26:10.334
crucifying him and what Jesus recognizes.

00:26:10.334 --> 00:26:11.925
They did not understand.

00:26:12.495 --> 00:26:13.365
And he said, forgive them.

00:26:13.365 --> 00:26:17.415
He had compassion on them too many
times when we go to a tress, false

00:26:17.415 --> 00:26:21.945
teaching or someone who disagrees with
us, we're addressing them with anger.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.710
The enemy's not them, the
person, we're not the enemy.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:29.340
When we have disagreements, we have an
enemy that's deceiving and confusing us.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.460
And so when we go into these
conversations, we go into

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.050
them with love and compassion.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:39.810
We're not going to waiver on truth,
or we're going to go into them with

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:43.860
truth and love with truth and love
because that's the way that Jesus model.

00:26:45.305 --> 00:26:48.485
So Paul's charge again, was to
stay for Timothy to stay and

00:26:48.485 --> 00:26:49.565
address this false teaching.

00:26:49.565 --> 00:26:49.865
Right.

00:26:50.135 --> 00:26:52.355
And Timothy's goal should be
instruction with love, right?

00:26:52.355 --> 00:26:57.905
Truth with love, but knowing who the
enemy truly is, but for him and for us.

00:26:57.905 --> 00:27:00.875
And I think this is for us as won't
get begin to learn is in order to

00:27:00.875 --> 00:27:05.525
correct false teaching, we have to
know what false teaching is there is

00:27:05.645 --> 00:27:08.225
and what, how we test false teaching.

00:27:08.615 --> 00:27:11.825
And so that's what Paul begins to
explain here in verses eight through 12.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.960
How we need to understand the
false teaching specifically here,

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.310
what Timothy was addressing.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:21.660
So it says this in verse eight, it
says, but we know that the law is good,

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.820
provided one uses it legitimately.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.870
And so when we look at this first charge
here, as he's addressing false teachers

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.920
over the law, but he's saying that
there's a good part of what he's teaching,

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.050
which means the law itself was good.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.120
It's there for a reason.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.840
Um, and when we think about the old
Testament law, again, it was given.

00:27:41.085 --> 00:27:44.715
And the old Testament it was
given to follow for a time.

00:27:45.525 --> 00:27:48.615
It was given to reveal the sin
that was in their life and their

00:27:48.615 --> 00:27:50.535
need for God's forgiveness.

00:27:51.225 --> 00:27:54.885
But sometimes it was used as a
standard to hit, to justify them

00:27:54.885 --> 00:27:58.545
rather than a standard to see
and know you'll never make, but

00:27:58.545 --> 00:28:00.405
knowing that God did through Jesus.

00:28:02.135 --> 00:28:04.415
So he affirmed again that
it was taught correctly.

00:28:04.415 --> 00:28:05.255
It would be valuable.

00:28:05.585 --> 00:28:08.135
But we see here in verse nine, it
says this, it says, we know that

00:28:08.135 --> 00:28:09.025
the law is not meant for the.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.420
But for the lawless and the rebellious
and he goes on and on and on.

00:28:13.139 --> 00:28:15.899
And so these false teachers
were leading people away from

00:28:15.899 --> 00:28:17.460
grace and back into legalism.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:22.230
And the challenge to that today
is I believe we still deal with

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.210
that currently in our society.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:30.330
Why I love to have things in my control.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.510
Anybody else like you, I mean,
if you don't like things into

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.470
your control, be surprised.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.129
Yes, you do too.

00:28:35.129 --> 00:28:35.460
Good.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.200
I'm not the only one I saw you nod.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.100
That makes me feel good.

00:28:38.129 --> 00:28:38.520
Good.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.389
We like to, to have control of our lives.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.220
So when we take the law and
we say, well, I can hit this

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.330
mark and I can hit this market.

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:50.409
It makes me feel good.

00:28:50.409 --> 00:28:51.970
And it's all about me.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:57.610
It really ends up taking
the need from God, right.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:58.419
That we even need God.

00:28:58.419 --> 00:29:00.939
Well then when we keep hitting these
standards and all of a sudden we feel.

00:29:02.345 --> 00:29:04.895
We missed the mark again, and we missed
the mark again and we missed the mark

00:29:04.895 --> 00:29:06.215
again and we go, we'll never attain.

00:29:06.215 --> 00:29:07.264
It will never attain it.

00:29:07.774 --> 00:29:09.335
And again, that's the problem.

00:29:09.365 --> 00:29:14.284
He was said he was drawing
believers away from Jesus back to

00:29:14.284 --> 00:29:16.115
their own control of their faith.

00:29:16.715 --> 00:29:18.245
And I'll tell you that that's a burden.

00:29:18.784 --> 00:29:24.365
That is a burden that is never for us to
be to bear because you'll never hit it.

00:29:24.514 --> 00:29:26.764
I struggle and fell every day.

00:29:27.004 --> 00:29:30.455
And if I didn't have grace and mercy, I
think I would give up, I would give up.

00:29:32.115 --> 00:29:37.335
And so we see here, um, that, uh, in
Jesus said this in Matthew 23 through

00:29:37.335 --> 00:29:41.235
27, when he's talking about the, those
who try to work for their salvation,

00:29:41.504 --> 00:29:42.555
this is what ends up happening.

00:29:42.555 --> 00:29:47.385
So Matthew 23, 27, 3 28 says this
woe to you, scribes and Pharisees.

00:29:47.865 --> 00:29:48.585
He says hypocrites.

00:29:48.585 --> 00:29:51.405
And again, that he's speaking to the
teachers of the law, he says you're like

00:29:51.435 --> 00:29:56.085
whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful
on the outside, but inside are full of

00:29:56.085 --> 00:29:58.475
bones of the dead and every kind of.

00:29:59.505 --> 00:30:01.245
And he kind of gives a little
bit better explanation of this.

00:30:01.245 --> 00:30:05.055
He says in the same way, on the
outside, you seem righteous, but on

00:30:05.055 --> 00:30:08.535
the inside, you're full of hip-hop
Hickock, hypocrisy, and lawlessness.

00:30:09.405 --> 00:30:13.725
And so what happens when we try to follow
the law is on an outward appearance.

00:30:13.905 --> 00:30:17.115
We feel justified, but
inward we're still dying.

00:30:17.145 --> 00:30:22.515
We're still struggling because we'll
know we'll never meet that expectation

00:30:22.515 --> 00:30:26.205
that God has from us, which is a
perfect, perfect following of that.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:30.150
So, let me share just a brief
briefly about my testimony and

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:31.320
why this means so much to me.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:37.170
I spent my first year, so after we had
our daughter, our first daughter, um,

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:40.590
we realized we needed to be figured
this whole religious thing out.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.630
At least I did, my wife had a
better figured out than I did.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.190
So I'm like, all right,
we'll go to church.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.440
I spent the first year in church.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.390
Listening to the word and going, I
need to be better and I would go home

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.170
and I would, I would try to do this
and I would try to try to do that.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:58.380
And then I would try to think better
and not look at that or think that, or

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.830
maybe I'm going to open my Bible today
and meant, it seemed like for a whole

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:06.000
year, it was exhausting for a whole year.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.720
I got a little bit better, but
something was missing because

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.890
I knew I couldn't do it.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.460
It took me a year to realize on that.

00:31:14.415 --> 00:31:15.945
I'll never meet that expectation.

00:31:16.335 --> 00:31:20.325
And I laid down, basically, I laid
down every expectation ahead of myself

00:31:20.355 --> 00:31:24.524
and I said, Jesus, I need you to
meet the expectation that you have.

00:31:24.675 --> 00:31:27.764
And at that moment, the burden was lifted.

00:31:28.335 --> 00:31:29.325
The pressure was lifted.

00:31:29.715 --> 00:31:34.485
Now, did I still aspire to do good
things and to follow after Jesus?

00:31:34.754 --> 00:31:35.745
Absolutely.

00:31:35.895 --> 00:31:40.155
But it was without the burden of,
I have to hit this expectation.

00:31:40.395 --> 00:31:41.405
And so I needed.

00:31:42.165 --> 00:31:43.755
Grace and mercy, and it took me a year.

00:31:43.755 --> 00:31:46.755
And for some of you, maybe you're
wrestling with that same thing of

00:31:46.755 --> 00:31:49.545
why do I keep just missing the mark?

00:31:49.545 --> 00:31:50.775
And I keep being defeated.

00:31:50.955 --> 00:31:53.025
No seek Jesus.

00:31:53.025 --> 00:31:54.165
And he will help you.

00:31:54.645 --> 00:31:55.545
Not right.

00:31:55.545 --> 00:31:56.535
He'll meet that expectation.

00:31:57.435 --> 00:32:00.375
And so the law again, was
not meant for those who have

00:32:00.375 --> 00:32:01.335
given their lives to Christ.

00:32:01.335 --> 00:32:04.754
And so when we think about the laws of
believer, it's meant to remind us, and

00:32:04.754 --> 00:32:08.445
this is my challenge for you today, as
a believer, it's meant to remind you of

00:32:08.445 --> 00:32:12.044
what you came out of, that you don't have
to do that Jesus would fulfill the law

00:32:12.375 --> 00:32:14.415
and that we are free from that burden.

00:32:15.074 --> 00:32:17.655
But then he specifically talks
about the unbeliever, right?

00:32:17.655 --> 00:32:20.475
And he lists 14 different kinds of
people that are condemned by the law.

00:32:20.685 --> 00:32:22.804
And it's not an all-inclusive
statement because even.

00:32:23.729 --> 00:32:24.360
At the end of it.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.110
He ever mentioned those 14 things
he says, uh, and for whatever

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:31.500
else is contrary to sound teaching
that conforms to the gospel.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.889
So if there was something on these 14,
it's like, well, I'm, these don't even

00:32:34.889 --> 00:32:40.199
list me it's because any way that we fall
short that doesn't meet that expectation.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.040
Right.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:45.060
And so what is the law's purpose
for those who don't know Christ,

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:52.065
it's a mirror it's and it's a it's,
it's a way to look at and say, What

00:32:52.065 --> 00:32:54.615
in my life is not right with God.

00:32:54.615 --> 00:32:57.285
And what we'll find is, as we look
in the mirror, we see blemishes, we

00:32:57.285 --> 00:33:01.035
see things that we're, we're never
going to, to correct, or we're going

00:33:01.035 --> 00:33:02.475
to ever be able to hit the standard.

00:33:03.105 --> 00:33:06.045
And so it's, it's, it's this
big, um, again, picture where

00:33:06.045 --> 00:33:08.865
the law is used to expose and
convict those who break the law.

00:33:08.895 --> 00:33:09.225
Right.

00:33:09.405 --> 00:33:10.515
But it can't save them.

00:33:11.325 --> 00:33:13.155
And so I want to show
you guys a picture here.

00:33:13.575 --> 00:33:16.145
Um, and this picture is going to be pretty
funny, cause you're going to blow it.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.980
You're going to see that all of
us are dirty on this picture.

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:23.580
And so let me tell you the story
behind why this means so much to him.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.340
So I went, he used to go to,
when I was in my old church in

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.670
Oklahoma, we went on a mission trip
to Ghana, west Africa every year.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:33.570
And this year we happened
to go and we had a big team.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:37.050
We had 20 people, so you should
bring 20 people to Africa and they

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.570
say, Hey, here's how we're going
to haul you in the back of trucks.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.960
And so we put like six or eight of our
team members in the back of trucks and

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.340
we would drive two hours out in the.

00:33:45.135 --> 00:33:48.735
And we would plant churches and train
leaders while we were at the back end

00:33:48.735 --> 00:33:54.885
of our trip and it poured and we had to
jump back in the truck and it got dark

00:33:55.215 --> 00:34:00.525
and we drove home two hours driving
home and we walk inside the guest

00:34:00.525 --> 00:34:02.325
house and everybody starts laughing.

00:34:02.325 --> 00:34:05.355
Those who were inside the cab obviously
were clean, but we were on the outside.

00:34:06.314 --> 00:34:08.205
They start laughing and we're
like, why are you laughing?

00:34:08.205 --> 00:34:09.884
They're like your Teeter
teeth are so wide.

00:34:09.975 --> 00:34:10.694
Like, what do you mean?

00:34:11.174 --> 00:34:12.014
Cause you're so dirty.

00:34:12.014 --> 00:34:15.165
Like basically we were covered in
dirt and they had to take a picture

00:34:15.165 --> 00:34:16.665
so we could see our condition.

00:34:17.804 --> 00:34:20.114
So let me give you an example here.

00:34:20.895 --> 00:34:23.114
We had no clue our condition.

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:27.645
So the law, when we look into
the law, the law tells us our

00:34:27.645 --> 00:34:28.725
condition that we'll never.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:32.460
Meet the expectation guys has
forced that we have areas of

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:33.900
our life that are not right.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:38.850
That will, will struggle to ever
be right with God apart from grace.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.710
So what did we do when
we saw that picture?

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:43.290
The first thing we knew
we needed was a shower.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.500
So we went, took a share.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.310
Now here's the thing.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.460
It took me a long time to get
the dirt out of the crevices.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:50.820
Right.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.710
And I probably still found some many days.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:58.110
And after that shower, I felt
refreshed and freed from what I

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:01.590
had experienced after seeing that
picture and realizing how dirty I was.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:07.980
I think about that with Jesus is when we
come to Jesus, we're new, we're clean.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:12.150
And that burden of sin that I had in
my life to the expectations with all

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:16.320
the pressure had on my life, roofs
removed because I came to Jesus and

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.080
recognized my need recognized my name.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.210
See James 1 23.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:23.880
3 24 says this.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.240
It says if anyone is a hearer of the
word and not a doer, he is like someone

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:31.800
looking at his own face in a mirror for,
he looks at himself and goes away and

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:38.100
immediately forgets the person he was
see when we look into the law and see our

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.910
condition and our inability to meet its
requirements, we have to make a choice.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.890
We, we can't walk away.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:45.990
When you see that picture,
you can't walk away and go.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.360
I'm just going to forget my condition.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.030
I can't walk away and not
recognize my need for a shower.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:56.440
See when we see the law, we
can't walk away and forget it.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:02.320
But at times we do, especially when
we don't know Christ, we walk away and

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.040
we, we forget because we don't want
to address our need for someone else.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.960
We love being able to
handle things on our own.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:09.740
We love to be able to make ourselves feel.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.200
But we'll never be right apart from that.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:18.090
And so Paul reminds us here and I love
this, this idea as we really finish up

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:21.810
today, it's Paul reminds us that the
law and the gospel worked together.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.140
They're not meant to be
at war against each other.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:27.060
And here's just a great quote.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.640
I wish I would have put it up here
so you could read it with me, but it

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.380
says this Warren Wisbey says this.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:38.010
He says the law without the gospel is
just a diagnosis of our condition without.

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:42.960
I'm gonna say that again, the law, without
the gospel, as just a diagnosis of her

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.420
condition without the remedy, but the
gospel without the law is only good news

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.040
of salvation for people who believe that.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:53.290
I don't know if that makes sense to you.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:54.940
And I'm going to kind of
repeat this in a different way.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.750
When we look into the law and
we don't have the gospel, we see

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:00.820
something we'll never be cured of.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:04.090
We'll never meet the expectations and
we're only going to live a defeated

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:05.920
life because we can't meet those.

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:08.560
If we only have the gospel, we go, great.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.450
You have a cure for
something I don't need.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.770
I don't see a need for it.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.420
But when we put them together,
we recognize our need and

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.410
we've been given the medicine.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:20.000
That's.

00:37:20.925 --> 00:37:25.065
The law and the gospel, which is found in
the word of God, which is truth, working

00:37:25.065 --> 00:37:28.605
together, not against each other, it's not
one or the other it's working together.

00:37:29.715 --> 00:37:34.065
And so I think when we look at this,
Paul is challenging Timothy to remove

00:37:34.065 --> 00:37:37.335
the burden from the believers who
were trying to go back and fulfill

00:37:37.335 --> 00:37:40.485
the law and say that the law has
already been fulfilled through Jesus.

00:37:40.485 --> 00:37:43.515
And those who are in the church
that may not know Christ, he's

00:37:43.515 --> 00:37:46.725
removing the burden that they are
trying to attain on their own.

00:37:47.385 --> 00:37:48.845
And he's giving them the cure.

00:37:50.174 --> 00:37:50.924
Through the gospel.

00:37:52.004 --> 00:37:53.654
That's what we have today.

00:37:54.194 --> 00:37:56.384
So Paul's challenge to Timothy
was the teach the truth

00:37:56.415 --> 00:37:57.495
and correct false teaching.

00:37:57.795 --> 00:37:59.984
He, again, he charged him with
you to instruct and correct

00:37:59.984 --> 00:38:02.355
with love, with love, right?

00:38:02.955 --> 00:38:07.125
With the response of it, to come
out with love and to remove again,

00:38:07.125 --> 00:38:10.245
the burden of works focused, right?

00:38:10.275 --> 00:38:12.615
To be able to justify yourself
through works rather than great.

00:38:13.665 --> 00:38:14.745
So what's our take home.

00:38:14.745 --> 00:38:16.635
And I started asking myself this
question, okay, that's great for

00:38:16.635 --> 00:38:20.025
Timothy and the church of emphasis
and the leader of ministry.

00:38:20.025 --> 00:38:20.475
Great.

00:38:20.475 --> 00:38:21.915
He's addressing false teachers.

00:38:21.945 --> 00:38:22.395
Whoo.

00:38:22.515 --> 00:38:23.655
What's that mean for us?

00:38:23.865 --> 00:38:24.825
So here's my challenge.

00:38:24.825 --> 00:38:28.575
I started thinking through this, I believe
God has charged us as a church, right?

00:38:28.575 --> 00:38:30.315
He's given us this word
to walk through today.

00:38:31.125 --> 00:38:33.075
He's charged us as a
church to teach the truth.

00:38:34.275 --> 00:38:38.175
He's charged us as a church to
create false teaching, starting

00:38:38.175 --> 00:38:39.615
right here within our service.

00:38:40.635 --> 00:38:45.585
But then sending us out daily to confront
truths or false teaching with truths.

00:38:46.185 --> 00:38:49.005
How do we address false
teaching with truth one?

00:38:49.005 --> 00:38:49.875
We've got to know the truth.

00:38:49.905 --> 00:38:54.075
So we need to spend time with in
the word, seek the word, test.

00:38:54.135 --> 00:38:59.565
Anything that would be taught to when
to address with love, with love, not

00:38:59.565 --> 00:39:05.295
hate, not judgment, but with love with
the outcome and the prayer that you

00:39:05.295 --> 00:39:07.065
have in your heart of love to come.

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:08.460
Right.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.510
And this is as a church.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:12.390
We want to have open
conversations about truth.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.080
Right?

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:14.970
Love shared with truth.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.270
And I started thinking about this
verse, John 1335 says this by

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:23.640
everyone, or by this, everyone will
know that you are my disciples.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:29.280
If you love one another, our love for
one another will prove our love for

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.100
Christ and the love that he's shown us.

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:36.270
So my challenge for us
is to take these things.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:42.970
And to live them out in our lives
to teach truth, to give truth to

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:46.120
others that were challenged and
also receive the truth from others.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:46.720
That may be one.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.990
I didn't talk about enough as
received truth from others with love.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.330
And to address these things that we have
to deal with with the law, if you're

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:57.390
living in a way that you're following
the law, or you're trying to attain

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:59.250
something on your own, apart from grace.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:01.169
So this is how I want us to respond.

00:40:01.169 --> 00:40:05.100
As we go into invitation, we
w here's what invitation is.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.210
And I challenge every week.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.230
This is, we don't come in to teach you
something where you're like, okay, great.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.830
That was great.

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:11.640
Let's clap hands.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.129
And we're going to walk out of here and
high five it's it's time to actually

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:18.560
take time at the end of our message and
say, Hey God, what does this mean to.

00:40:19.379 --> 00:40:20.819
Like, how does this apply to my life?

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:22.620
What should I begin to take home for?

00:40:23.759 --> 00:40:26.040
And so this is why we have
something called imitation.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:30.480
Imitation is really a time to
reflect and seek your heart.

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:32.580
And so a lot of times our
worship team will come up

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:34.680
here and they play music real.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.050
Here's what I would say is if
you're in a quiet room, a lot of

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:38.759
times it's difficult to think.

00:40:38.759 --> 00:40:42.029
And so what times we just fill the
room was a bit of music and give

00:40:42.029 --> 00:40:43.770
you some time to consider God.

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:44.340
What are you teaching?

00:40:45.135 --> 00:40:45.945
What do you have for me?

00:40:45.945 --> 00:40:48.585
And so this is what I would just love for
you guys to do is just go ahead and close

00:40:48.585 --> 00:40:53.505
your eyes, bow your heads, and to begin
to get an attitude of, of really openness.

00:40:53.505 --> 00:40:53.745
Okay.

00:40:53.745 --> 00:40:54.705
Lord, speak to me.

00:40:55.725 --> 00:40:58.365
And as you're doing that, I'm just going
to share a few things with you that you

00:40:58.365 --> 00:41:01.365
can begin to consider in your heart.

00:41:01.545 --> 00:41:02.835
So go ahead and do that right now.

00:41:02.865 --> 00:41:04.545
And then I'm just going to
share a few things with you.

00:41:06.225 --> 00:41:10.505
Um, I believe just based upon the
word of God today, as we were.

00:41:12.569 --> 00:41:15.210
That God could be challenging
each one of us this.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:17.610
And so maybe this is what you
pray to God that you commit to,

00:41:17.819 --> 00:41:19.200
to rejecting false teaching.

00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.770
Right.

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:22.980
And you begin to commit to testing
it against the word of God.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:26.009
So maybe that's what you
need to reflect on today.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.940
Commit to ask the Lord how to address
these things with love, right?

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.290
To confront these teachings with.

00:41:36.785 --> 00:41:40.175
Something that my challenge to you is,
is I think the church is known more for

00:41:40.175 --> 00:41:41.915
what we're against than what we're for.

00:41:41.975 --> 00:41:45.785
And maybe this is a time where you
challenge yourself to continue to

00:41:45.785 --> 00:41:47.495
teach other people what we're for.

00:41:48.455 --> 00:41:49.175
We're for them.

00:41:49.955 --> 00:41:50.795
We're for truth.

00:41:51.185 --> 00:41:52.055
We're for Jesus.

00:41:54.905 --> 00:41:57.415
Here's my challenge, as well as
maybe this is a time for you.

00:41:57.415 --> 00:42:03.595
If you are a believer to take time in
this reflection to thank God for Jesus.

00:42:05.174 --> 00:42:11.685
For grace and mercy and forgiveness
again, of what the law reveals,

00:42:11.685 --> 00:42:14.234
maybe that's where you're at today
is just the attitude of praise and

00:42:14.234 --> 00:42:17.055
Thanksgiving for what God did through
Jesus that he removed that burden.

00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:20.174
So maybe that's during your time of
reflection, you're asking God that

00:42:22.065 --> 00:42:25.115
here's one that I'll really want to
challenge you on though, is if maybe

00:42:25.115 --> 00:42:29.825
you came in here today and you've
been trying to live your life right.

00:42:29.855 --> 00:42:30.185
To be.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.210
Thinking that that's all
it takes to be right with.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:35.020
God it's just to be good.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:35.680
Good enough.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.310
And maybe today you hear the law and
you hear the, you think about man,

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.820
I, I'm probably never going to hit
all these marks that, that really

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:46.270
the law presents as these list of
things and rules I should follow.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.330
And maybe you realize that
what you need is Jesus.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:53.500
The thing that Peter or somebody
Paul was pressuring and challenging

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:57.280
Timothy to teach, which is grace,
mercy and freedom from your sin.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.300
Maybe that's you today.

00:42:59.504 --> 00:43:02.714
It is, if that is you today, where
you need to give your life to Jesus,

00:43:02.714 --> 00:43:06.254
which means this, you want to and
desire to receive that grace and

00:43:06.254 --> 00:43:09.134
mercy from Jesus so that you can
remove that burden you can today.

00:43:09.855 --> 00:43:12.105
We don't, I would say this, and
that's what I love about Jesus.

00:43:12.314 --> 00:43:13.665
He doesn't complicate this.

00:43:13.875 --> 00:43:16.785
You don't have to go through all
these works to receive salvation.

00:43:18.615 --> 00:43:19.845
It's an attitude of the heart.

00:43:20.544 --> 00:43:22.154
Here's what God says.

00:43:22.334 --> 00:43:23.805
How do we give our lives to Jesus?

00:43:23.805 --> 00:43:27.134
How do we remove the burden of trying
to follow the law and try to be.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:32.050
Is by admitting that you've fallen
short, that you have a need and

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:34.450
that you can't meet the, meet the
requirement of the law, right.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:35.710
That you can't follow up perfectly.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:41.350
So you admit you have a need, you admit
that you need Jesus to save you from that

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:43.780
brokenness and commit to following him.

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:50.260
Here's what the Bible says is if you'll
believe in your heart and confess with

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:55.150
your mouth, who the Lord Jesus is and
your need for him, that you'll be safe.

00:43:57.029 --> 00:43:58.049
So that's what it takes.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:43:59.640
Maybe that's what you need.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.620
And so during this time reflection,
maybe that's what you need to pray.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.040
Lord, save me, change my heart
and giving my life to you.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.230
If that is you hear is
a bold challenge to you.

00:44:11.279 --> 00:44:14.609
God has not challenged you to accept
Christ and keep it to yourself.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.450
He's called you to accept Christ
and be a part of the body of

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:20.040
Christ, where we celebrate together.

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:23.609
If you want to, or if you have given
your life to Christ in this moment

00:44:23.609 --> 00:44:27.765
of praying, I want you to come talk
to me during this time of invitation.

00:44:28.005 --> 00:44:30.225
I want you to come talk to me
after service and say, Hey Ben,

00:44:31.065 --> 00:44:33.255
I've given my life to Jesus, or
I want to give my life to Jesus.

00:44:33.255 --> 00:44:36.525
I want to talk about what it means to
follow Jesus and experience that freedom.

00:44:37.545 --> 00:44:43.214
I'll tell you going one more day of
saying you'll do it next week is only

00:44:43.214 --> 00:44:48.105
going to be more burden for you to face
when God has freedom to give you today.

00:44:49.214 --> 00:44:50.595
So what we're going to
do is I'm going to pray.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.910
And we're just gonna take a few minutes
where you continue to reflect on that

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.700
as they pray softly, and whenever
they lead us in worship, you stand.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.250
And at any moment you need prayer.

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:00.750
You want to talk about
giving your life to Jesus.

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:03.000
I'm going to be in the back
there to talk to you about that.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.710
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:05.610
We love you, Lord.

00:45:06.029 --> 00:45:09.240
And God, we are so thankful for your
word because we know it as truth.

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:14.310
And we know that in it is life,
life, where we don't have to be

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.400
burdened by all the things we think
we need to do to be right with you.

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:20.070
All the things we think we
need to do to be justified.

00:45:21.375 --> 00:45:22.214
To be perfect.

00:45:22.305 --> 00:45:23.865
Lord is all we need is you.

00:45:24.825 --> 00:45:27.795
And if we'll just turn our lives to
you, Lord, that we will receive freedom.

00:45:28.484 --> 00:45:32.415
And that as we walk in that freedom Lord,
that we will enjoy the things we do and

00:45:32.415 --> 00:45:34.154
we'll do the things we do out of love.

00:45:34.154 --> 00:45:37.365
Not out of half to Lord.

00:45:37.365 --> 00:45:39.615
I pray if there's someone in this room
that needs to give their life to you,

00:45:39.615 --> 00:45:43.545
Lord, I pray today is the day that Lord,
they will not let one more day go by,

00:45:43.605 --> 00:45:46.455
but that today's the day of salvation
that they will give their lives to you.

00:45:46.665 --> 00:45:48.435
And then begin to walk in
the truth that they do know.

00:45:50.345 --> 00:45:50.555
Lord.

00:45:50.555 --> 00:45:52.745
I pray if there's someone in this
room that maybe it's just as, I've

00:45:52.745 --> 00:45:56.045
been a believer for awhile, that
is burdening themselves, Lord, with

00:45:56.045 --> 00:45:58.775
trying to meet these expectations
that they have on their lives.

00:45:59.015 --> 00:46:01.865
Lord, I pray where you remove that
burden, that they stop trying to

00:46:01.865 --> 00:46:06.275
live a life of perfection, but they
start trying to live a life that it's

00:46:06.275 --> 00:46:07.505
really just a relationship with you.

00:46:07.505 --> 00:46:10.325
And out of that relationship,
look, you will change their life.

00:46:10.625 --> 00:46:12.425
So Lord remove that
burden from them as well.

00:46:13.475 --> 00:46:17.525
Lord, we pray as a church that
we teach truth that we are not.

00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:20.805
Going to be listed among those
who would be false teachers.

00:46:20.805 --> 00:46:24.615
Lord, not because, um, we're
better a whole, gosh, Lord.

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:28.515
It's it's really because we
are every week recognizing our

00:46:28.515 --> 00:46:30.165
brokenness and need for your truth.

00:46:31.515 --> 00:46:36.615
So Lord help us as we go about
our lives to test the teachings

00:46:36.615 --> 00:46:37.964
around us and the things we hear.

00:46:39.225 --> 00:46:42.525
And Lord, may you give us wisdom
on what truth is to follow?

00:46:43.305 --> 00:46:45.944
So Lord, we love you and we
pray this in your holy name.

00:46:46.605 --> 00:46:46.875
Amen.
