00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.220
So it is, um, it's a good morning.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.810
I'm super pumped about this morning.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.610
I'm in the word that God has for us.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.370
We're going to be in Exodus 17 today.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.710
Um, we have spent just the last say
last week and this week in Exodus

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.870
16, and then this weekend next to 17.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:29.715
Um, God had just given me some,
some messages within my quiet time.

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:30.555
And that's what I always tell people.

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:34.635
The best messages that we have is in our
daily quiet time, because God speaks to us

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:35.745
and then we get to share that with others.

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:38.925
And so, um, out of that, we
got to deal with last week.

00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:44.205
Um, just this idea of what happens
when we forget to remember.

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:46.425
Um, and so we just learned, right.

00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:47.385
We complain and grumble.

00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:53.445
And we question God, and we begin to try
to take things back into our own control.

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:57.465
But when that happens, we actually
end up missing out on experiencing

00:00:57.465 --> 00:00:59.475
the joy of God's blessings.

00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:02.085
Um, and so how does that
really apply to today?

00:01:02.355 --> 00:01:04.754
Um, what we actually,
interestingly enough, I want to

00:01:04.754 --> 00:01:05.625
kind of catch you up on this.

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:08.865
If you didn't read this after
we got done, seeing what.

00:01:09.714 --> 00:01:10.494
When you forget to remember.

00:01:10.494 --> 00:01:14.184
Cause again, if you remember, the
people of Israel had seen God do

00:01:14.184 --> 00:01:15.205
some miraculous things, right.

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:18.865
Part waters, destroy their enemy
or save them, you know, from that.

00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:22.645
Um, and what did they do after they forgot
to remember and God provided for them.

00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:23.425
They forgot again.

00:01:23.455 --> 00:01:25.734
They begin to complain and grumble
and really all the way up to

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:26.994
what we're going to read today.

00:01:27.324 --> 00:01:31.375
Um, in verse eight of chapter 17, uh,
they had just got done complaining again.

00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:34.945
Um, but this is where we're going to kind
of see this, like, Hey, what happened?

00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:38.065
Um, and we're going to see where
God shows us today that we are.

00:01:38.925 --> 00:01:40.545
Together we are better together.

00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:43.365
And I think most of you would
probably agree with that

00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:44.595
sentiment for the most part.

00:01:44.985 --> 00:01:46.905
Um, so let me start off
by asking this question.

00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:48.615
I love asking questions at the beginning.

00:01:48.615 --> 00:01:50.115
How many of y'all?

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:54.945
Yes, I'm still saying y'all, um,
have ever held something above your

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:56.655
head for any extended period of time.

00:01:58.445 --> 00:01:58.775
Okay.

00:01:58.805 --> 00:01:59.945
Keep holding your hands up.

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:00.965
Keep holding your hand.

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:01.325
Okay.

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:03.125
Now everybody has a F.

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:03.395
Okay.

00:02:03.395 --> 00:02:06.005
So if you've done that, what are
some things you've held above?

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.490
Rifle a fan.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.420
Okay.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.160
What else?

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.820
Big stick.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.300
Okay.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.580
Sounds like you're Moses over here.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.440
We're getting ready to talk about
Moses holding a big stick out.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.010
That's good.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.190
So if anybody's like me you've
you probably have helped somebody

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.740
hold some sheet, rock up now
doing sheet rock on a wall.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.130
Simple.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.760
Like let's just hold.

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.250
But the moment you start doing sheet rock
up here, you realize how strong you are.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.700
It's right.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.170
Difficult to hold your hands up.

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.200
Um, and so we realized that when it
comes to, I'm just trying to think

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.560
about holding up sheet rock and
putting that in, in the ceiling, um,

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:44.910
that it takes more than one person.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.390
Right?

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.260
And I started thinking about this
every one of us each day, um, in

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.560
our lives and our jobs, you know,
maybe it's our family members.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.109
We are dependent upon them fulfilling.

00:02:55.905 --> 00:02:57.975
Whatever it is that they
have to do with you.

00:02:57.975 --> 00:03:01.005
So I think about this with my wife
is if she tried to raise our kids,

00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:03.734
take care of everything at our house
on her own, it would be difficult.

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:07.515
So it's this idea where whenever
I participate in whatever the

00:03:07.515 --> 00:03:09.975
kids actually now they're at the
age, they can start doing things.

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:13.605
We realized that it's easier
to accomplish the task at hand.

00:03:14.114 --> 00:03:14.924
We're better together.

00:03:15.584 --> 00:03:18.915
So as we jump into the story,
we're really going to be seeing the

00:03:18.924 --> 00:03:20.505
idea how we are better together.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.940
Um, and how that we can work
together to fill up the mission

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.810
that God's called us to.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.210
And so just as a church, um, if you don't
know, as a church, what do we exist to do?

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.590
What is our mission as a church?

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.280
Well, we believe our mission is
to inspire hope by helping people

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.320
discover God's purpose for.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.310
Through a relationship with Jesus.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.680
We really believe every single
person that's in this room.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.860
That's in our city, that's in the
world, has a divine purpose from God.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.750
Number one, have a relationship with him.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.210
And number two, to fulfill
the call in life, right?

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.530
The call I've learned a call is an
invitation to be a part of God's work.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.060
And as we discover that purpose for
other people, as we help them discover

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.470
that we start to see God's mission.

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.130
And so it's a cool how we're going to
see this really kind of intertwined

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.910
with the story of Moses and Aaron and
her and Joshua and the army and God

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.220
overseeing this battle that they go into.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.630
Um, and so my hope is, as you think
through, and maybe even rate yourself

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.630
this, I want you to think through this
right now, even if you're not a part

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.180
of inspiring hope, I still believe
you can be a part of God's mission.

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.610
I want you to just think how.

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.260
Effective am I being, helping other
people discover God's purpose for their

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.429
life through relationship with Jesus?

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:32.760
How am I being effective and
helping God accomplish the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.049
mission, which he's called me to.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.669
And just think about that.

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.940
And as you think about that, if that's
anything other than what I would say

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.059
is excelling where you are striving
for that, then I hope today you'll,

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:44.640
you'll be empowered by the word of God.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.750
Um, and by just encouragement
in this message to go be a

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.340
part of that, to stop living.

00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:54.224
What I would say is a second rate,
life start living a first rate

00:04:54.224 --> 00:04:58.275
life that God's called you to in
this, um, in this life that we have

00:04:58.335 --> 00:05:00.015
been called to go serve the Lord.

00:05:00.015 --> 00:05:00.284
Right.

00:05:00.674 --> 00:05:05.054
And so let's, let's jump into this
text again, exit, uh, 17, uh, starting

00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:09.854
in verse eight, it says this at, uh,
and I don't know how to say this word.

00:05:09.854 --> 00:05:15.825
So Rephidim amulet came and fought against
Israel and Moses said to Joshua select

00:05:15.825 --> 00:05:18.645
some men for us and go fight against.

00:05:19.755 --> 00:05:22.905
And tomorrow I will stand on the
hill with God's staff in my hand.

00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:27.765
And Joshua did, as Moses had told
him and fought against amylin

00:05:27.914 --> 00:05:31.275
while Moses and Aaron and Hur
went up on the top of the hill.

00:05:31.784 --> 00:05:33.284
And while Moses held his head.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.830
I held his hand up his real prevailed,
but whenever he put his hands

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.600
down and Molech prevailed and when
Moses his hands grew heavy, they

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.070
took a stone and put it under him.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.480
And as they sat down on it or as he
sat down on it and then Aaron and her

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.180
support his hands, a one on one side
and one on the other so that his hands

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.010
remained steady until the sun went down.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.950
And so Joshua defeated
amyloid and his armies.

00:06:00.315 --> 00:06:03.225
And then the Lord said to Moses,
write down on the scroll as a

00:06:03.225 --> 00:06:05.565
reminder and recite it to Joshua.

00:06:05.955 --> 00:06:10.095
I will completely block out the memory
of MLS under the heavens and Moses

00:06:10.095 --> 00:06:11.715
built an altar altar and named it.

00:06:11.715 --> 00:06:16.425
The Lord is my banner and he, and he said,
indeed, my hand is lifted up towards the

00:06:16.425 --> 00:06:21.135
Lord's throne and the Lord will be at war
with AMAC, from generation to generation.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.400
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.810
We just thank you Lord for today.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.570
And we thank you for this opportunity
to open your word and Lord, I

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.890
pray that you speak through it.

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:32.460
And Lord that we learn from those
who have gone before us and their

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.250
faithfulness to serve Lord in the way
in which you called them to serve.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.560
And so Lord, we just pray
this in your heavenly name.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.340
Amen.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.560
So the first thing we need to
recognize as we commit to fulfilling

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.800
the mission that God has called us
as to recognize we have an enemy.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.909
If you'll look there in verse
eight, we begin to see that Moses.

00:06:51.615 --> 00:06:53.205
Identifies that they have an enemy, right?

00:06:53.205 --> 00:06:53.895
It's amyloid.

00:06:54.045 --> 00:06:56.385
They came to fight against
Israel, God's people.

00:06:56.925 --> 00:07:00.825
So each one of us, as we go to
fulfill the mission, we have to

00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:02.505
know that we will have an enemy.

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:06.435
And if we don't identify that enemy, if
we don't understand the things that are

00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:10.755
working against us as the enemy, we can
get confused and we can get set back

00:07:10.755 --> 00:07:12.015
in the call that God's called us to.

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:14.955
And I start thinking through what are the
things that start stress, setting us back.

00:07:14.955 --> 00:07:16.275
Many of us think the enemy.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.800
It's just this guy, who's
going to be very noticeable.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.100
Right?

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.120
It's going to be like, we talk about the,
the devil with the red man suit the fork.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.000
Like it's simple to see, see that
the enemy is working against us, but

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.760
I began to realize that really the
enemy works against us through things

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.560
like stress divisions and marriage,
our kids not acting the way they

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.390
need to a loss of a job, a financial
issue, something in our life that is

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:44.280
distracting us from the mission of God
is really the enemy working against us.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.020
And so if we know we have.

00:07:46.905 --> 00:07:50.745
We also know that we need to
prepare ourselves for that.

00:07:50.745 --> 00:07:50.895
Right.

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:53.745
And if we are a part of what I would
say, if you guys remember as a kid, the

00:07:53.745 --> 00:07:56.655
Lord's army, that means we're soldiers.

00:07:57.075 --> 00:08:00.105
I'd like to call us
warriors, um, with this.

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:00.975
So let me ask this question.

00:08:00.975 --> 00:08:02.775
I want to get you guys
engaged in this thought.

00:08:03.195 --> 00:08:06.885
If you're a warrior, if you're
a soldier, what do you need to

00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:07.965
do before you go into battle?

00:08:08.895 --> 00:08:09.735
Somebody give you some ideas.

00:08:09.735 --> 00:08:11.055
What do you need to do
before you go into battle?

00:08:11.055 --> 00:08:15.915
If you're a warrior or a soldier prepare,
what'd you say, put on your armor.

00:08:17.604 --> 00:08:18.445
Practice.

00:08:19.775 --> 00:08:20.344
What else?

00:08:23.745 --> 00:08:24.164
Exercise.

00:08:24.164 --> 00:08:24.585
What'd you say?

00:08:25.245 --> 00:08:25.875
Training.

00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:26.715
Okay, good.

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:28.695
Yes.

00:08:29.055 --> 00:08:29.414
Yes.

00:08:29.445 --> 00:08:30.435
Don't go out alone.

00:08:31.245 --> 00:08:31.575
Okay.

00:08:32.025 --> 00:08:34.335
So, so all those things are
obviously exactly what we're saying.

00:08:34.335 --> 00:08:35.145
We're preparing, right.

00:08:35.145 --> 00:08:36.495
So how do we prepare one?

00:08:36.885 --> 00:08:37.544
We need to know about.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:39.810
We need to know our enemy.

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.140
Number two, we need to train and
prepare for the battle at hand.

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:43.380
Right.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.130
That's logical.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.370
And so here, just to, just to kind
of give you some brief again, God's

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.130
word tells us who our enemy is.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:50.550
Right.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.430
Um, and so one of the things I do
know is I started reading about this

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:59.790
as the enemy tries to still kill
and destroy anything that basically.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.979
Causes our faith to waiver.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.010
He tries to destroy our faith in
God and our confidence in God.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.349
So anything in our life, right.

00:09:07.349 --> 00:09:09.750
That distracts us from the
call of God, has this put on

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.359
us is what the enemy will use.

00:09:12.359 --> 00:09:12.540
Right.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.459
He's using those things to distract us.

00:09:14.459 --> 00:09:17.969
And so we identified that we have
an enemy, he begins to attack us and

00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:19.680
those ways, so we identified the enemy.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:19.920
Right.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.699
And then we prepare.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.770
So let me ask this, let's
be a little bit practical.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.770
How can we prepare for them?

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.670
And let's get in detail.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.680
How do we prepare to go into.

00:09:30.895 --> 00:09:31.734
How do you prepare?

00:09:31.765 --> 00:09:33.145
Maybe you do go into battle every day.

00:09:33.175 --> 00:09:33.925
How do you prepare

00:09:39.895 --> 00:09:40.645
being the word?

00:09:40.675 --> 00:09:41.064
Okay.

00:09:41.305 --> 00:09:43.015
What's the word going to
teach us about the enemy?

00:09:43.854 --> 00:09:44.214
Good.

00:09:44.275 --> 00:09:45.474
So what else, what else are you gonna do?

00:09:47.375 --> 00:09:47.795
Prey.

00:09:47.944 --> 00:09:53.135
So when we pray, it's, we're actually
dependent upon the Lord, right?

00:09:53.165 --> 00:09:54.964
That's the moment where we
start taking the control out

00:09:54.964 --> 00:09:56.104
of our hands to win the battle.

00:09:56.525 --> 00:09:57.155
And we put it in here.

00:09:58.065 --> 00:09:58.965
So that's another good one.

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:00.045
What's a, what's one more.

00:10:05.975 --> 00:10:07.475
We invite others to join in.

00:10:08.165 --> 00:10:09.695
We can't win the battle alone.

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.945
We are better together.

00:10:12.635 --> 00:10:19.025
So we see that in this text where Moses
says, Hey, Joshua, go get an army.

00:10:19.835 --> 00:10:21.155
He didn't say, Hey,
Josh, we'll go do this.

00:10:21.155 --> 00:10:22.085
He said, go get an army.

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:23.195
We're better together.

00:10:23.195 --> 00:10:25.385
Go prepare to go to feat this.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.770
And I love that idea behind right time.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.950
And God's word teaches us
to learn about our enemy.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.610
But time in the word also gives us
confidence that God will go before us

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.830
with us and use us despite maybe our
weaknesses prayer again, will shore

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.850
dependence upon him, but working with
others to design a plan of attack,

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.100
God has designed us to work together.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.300
And I started thinking about this.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.680
So I'm thinking of stories, right?

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.830
Some of us may think, Hey,
well I want to get David.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.060
And maybe, you know, that's who
you are as a David is going to go

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.890
out and you're going to defeat the
one person that is stopping the

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.210
people from winning the battle.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:04.890
Well, I started thinking about this.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:09.900
If the people wouldn't have got
confidence from that one, David and

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.810
ran to go to feed the rest of the
enemy, David still wouldn't have won.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.689
He may have won the battle,
but he'd not a won the war.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.040
So yes, we need to have
confidence in going into battle,

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.699
but we need to bring others.

00:11:22.045 --> 00:11:23.485
We need to bring others with us in this.

00:11:23.485 --> 00:11:27.505
So we need to know again, we need to
recognize that we have an enemy, right.

00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:30.355
That is trying to go against us.

00:11:32.065 --> 00:11:35.575
But I started thinking through this, let's
look at these different characters and how

00:11:35.575 --> 00:11:39.085
they begin to be a part of fulfilling the
mission that God called them to do right.

00:11:39.085 --> 00:11:40.225
To defeat this enemy.

00:11:40.885 --> 00:11:44.935
And I hope that as we begin to look at
these people in this text, we'll begin to

00:11:44.935 --> 00:11:49.465
see maybe ways in which we can represent,
uh, or we can re like we can relate.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.310
To go into the battle to fill the
mission that God's called us to do.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:57.570
So the first one we see here is Joshua
and the army in verses nine and 10.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.620
So I'm gonna read those again.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.640
It's this Moses said to Joshua select some
men for us to go fight against amyloid.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.570
And tomorrow I was saying on the hill
with John or with God staff in my hand,

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.620
and Joshua did just, as Moses had told
him and fought against ambulant while

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.240
Moses and Aaron and Hur went up on top of.

00:12:13.425 --> 00:12:15.464
See, I'm going to kind of break
down a couple of these characters.

00:12:15.464 --> 00:12:18.285
Joshua, if you don't know who
Joshua is, Joshua was really

00:12:18.285 --> 00:12:19.515
just an assistant to Moses.

00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:23.265
Um, if you know, a little bit more of the
story of, um, just the people of Israel

00:12:23.265 --> 00:12:27.645
coming out of the land of Egypt, um, they
went to the promised land and they sent

00:12:27.645 --> 00:12:31.995
12 people to go into the promised land,
to scout it out, to see if the land was

00:12:31.995 --> 00:12:35.535
full of milk and honey, and to see the
enemy in which they were going to go into.

00:12:35.834 --> 00:12:37.724
And there was two people
came back with a good report.

00:12:37.964 --> 00:12:38.685
Does he remember those two?

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:42.860
Joshua is one of them.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:49.370
Who's the other one, Caleb, see these two
guys had faith that God could defeat the

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:52.250
enemy that was large and obviously many.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.730
Um, and so we see that one, Joshua
was, was a part of that, right?

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.970
The other was eventually Joshua
would succeed Moses to lead.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.910
The people actually entered the
promised land after the 40 years

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.250
of wandering in the wilderness.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:04.580
Right.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.300
And so we also see that he
is a leader of the armies as.

00:13:09.285 --> 00:13:11.385
And so we, we also see this army, right?

00:13:11.385 --> 00:13:15.135
And there's not much detail, but it
says that Joshua selected men, right.

00:13:15.345 --> 00:13:19.035
That he chose that he knew that
he understood that they were

00:13:19.035 --> 00:13:21.045
committed to fulfilling the mission.

00:13:21.795 --> 00:13:27.435
Um, and as we continue to look at this,
I ever wonder, um, as Joshua was used

00:13:27.435 --> 00:13:30.465
by God, and as these people that I just
started thinking through this as, as

00:13:30.465 --> 00:13:34.305
Josh was choosing these people to go into
battle with him, Did you ever think if, if

00:13:34.305 --> 00:13:37.125
Joshua came to you, if you were there in
that day and Joshua came to you and said,

00:13:37.125 --> 00:13:39.944
Hey, come be a part of fulfilling the
mission that God's called us to fulfill.

00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:43.245
Would you kind of doubt whether you
could actually fulfill that mission?

00:13:43.724 --> 00:13:47.324
Anybody ever doubt whether God can
use you, anybody would ever doubt

00:13:47.324 --> 00:13:49.365
whether, you know, I'm not good enough.

00:13:49.365 --> 00:13:50.415
I don't know enough.

00:13:50.594 --> 00:13:51.915
I'm not gifted enough.

00:13:53.055 --> 00:13:53.354
I've been in.

00:13:54.194 --> 00:13:54.584
I've been there.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:57.614
I remember whenever I surrendered
to ministry, I'm almost

00:13:57.614 --> 00:13:58.814
like eight, nine years ago.

00:13:59.354 --> 00:14:02.175
And I was so passionate about a
surrendered ministry and high everything's

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.944
going to be easy from here on out.

00:14:04.755 --> 00:14:05.895
And it wasn't.

00:14:06.165 --> 00:14:07.935
And I started to think, okay,
well, what did I start doing?

00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:09.435
I started taking steps of faith.

00:14:09.795 --> 00:14:13.905
I remember that next week I invited a
group of students that I was serving.

00:14:14.175 --> 00:14:16.425
Um, just as an adult leader,
there a group invited a group of

00:14:16.425 --> 00:14:18.375
students to go and hand out flyers.

00:14:18.614 --> 00:14:19.635
You know, how many showed up?

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:25.230
We had a sit ministry of 60 and we
went out to hand out flyers and it

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.290
really didn't go very well, but I
was committed to be a part of what

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.790
God was doing to fulfill the mission.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.110
And so a couple of weeks later, I was
invited to teach a student ministry

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.880
thing, which I'd never taught before.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.430
And I taught the message in seven
minutes and it was horrible.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.350
So I retaught it again,
went 10 minutes long.

00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:43.770
Um, but I was committed in the mission.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:44.280
Right.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.640
And then later I actually preached on
a Sunday morning, which was even worse.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.340
But I was committed to the mission.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.370
And I remember over and over again,
wondering God, can you use me?

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.310
I mean, come on, like, this is bad.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.580
And he's like, yeah, but I'm good.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.110
And so when I realized this
as is, is it, it takes faith.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.560
It takes faith for each one of us.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.680
I think you guys probably
relate a lot with me.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.240
Can God use me?

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:13.470
Do I know one.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.089
Am I capable.

00:15:16.329 --> 00:15:20.650
And I think I wonder that happened with
Joshua and asking those to come with them.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:20.920
Right.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.099
Here's what I've learned in my many
years of just being faithful with

00:15:24.099 --> 00:15:29.079
the Lord is that over and over again,
God uses those who are faithful and

00:15:29.079 --> 00:15:31.660
willing who are faithful and willing.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.040
So I started picturing this.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.199
Joshua was going throughout the camp
and he's saying, I need people to

00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:36.729
go with me to fight this battle.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:38.500
And there were some that said, I'll go.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.030
And there were some that said.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.560
And everybody has a choice to be a
part of fulfilling God's mission, but

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:50.110
we have to be faithful and willing.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.520
And here's what I started.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:55.750
I started thinking back Hebrews 11 six is
one of my favorite verses in the Bible.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.470
It says without faith, we cannot
please God, without faith.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.569
It is impossible to please.

00:16:01.569 --> 00:16:04.600
God, I got a question I
want to step out here.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.250
How many of y'all want to please?

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.610
God, praise God.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.780
This is great.

00:16:10.665 --> 00:16:15.135
Because that's the first step
to take the next step, because

00:16:15.135 --> 00:16:16.064
if you want to please God.

00:16:16.785 --> 00:16:18.525
And if you want to please God,
and if you want to please,

00:16:18.525 --> 00:16:20.685
God, it's going to take faith.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.704
It's going to take faith and it's
going to take taking that next step,

00:16:24.735 --> 00:16:29.444
even though at times, you wonder,
am I even gonna be able to do this?

00:16:29.444 --> 00:16:30.465
It can God really.

00:16:31.725 --> 00:16:35.115
And the truth is he will
write, he requires you to bring

00:16:35.115 --> 00:16:37.125
nothing to the table, but faith.

00:16:37.425 --> 00:16:40.545
That's what I love about God, God,
doesn't say, Hey, bring everything

00:16:40.545 --> 00:16:41.535
you got, which means this.

00:16:41.535 --> 00:16:44.505
You need to figure out that have
you had four years of college or you

00:16:44.505 --> 00:16:47.265
need to have six years of seminary
or you need to be saved for 12 years.

00:16:47.265 --> 00:16:48.135
He doesn't say any of that.

00:16:48.135 --> 00:16:48.855
Here's what he says.

00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:52.635
If you'll have faith in
me, I will do the rest.

00:16:53.265 --> 00:16:54.705
All you have to do is go.

00:16:55.335 --> 00:16:56.595
And I love that about God.

00:17:00.795 --> 00:17:03.255
He provides the ability and
power to accomplish the task.

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:04.244
If we will just have faith.

00:17:06.175 --> 00:17:07.285
So where do we start?

00:17:07.285 --> 00:17:08.724
If we want to be part of God's big plan.

00:17:08.734 --> 00:17:09.595
I want to ask that question.

00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:10.615
Where do we start?

00:17:11.754 --> 00:17:14.214
When we want to be a part of God's
big plan to fulfill the mission?

00:17:14.214 --> 00:17:14.754
Where do we start?

00:17:16.194 --> 00:17:18.954
Surrender starts with a relationship.

00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:22.974
I think too many times guys, as
we, we want to be good people.

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:25.200
We want to do good things.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.050
And so we start doing good things and
that may be a good start, but if it's done

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.490
with a wrong heart, we missed the point
of God's ultimate plan for the mission.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.860
If we don't surrender to Jesus, if
we don't have a relationship with him

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:42.000
personally, the feeling the mission
will never happen because we'll be

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.930
going out on our own power and our own
attempt, and it will never be fulfilling

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.900
and it will never, never fulfill the
call that God has on your life to

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.150
fulfill the call that God has when
your life starts with a relationship.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:56.320
I talk about that every week,
because guys, sometimes we miss that.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:01.060
We want to be doers, but we don't want to
be beers, which means this be with Jesus.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.450
And I would say this, if we
don't spend time with Jesus,

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.439
we don't know who our enemy is.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.740
If we don't spend time with Jesus,
we don't know how he's equipping us.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.370
And then he goes before us, if we
aren't with Jesus every day, we aren't

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.990
inviting other people to join us.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:20.200
So that is where we have to start
heard this statement yesterday.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:21.810
I just think it was Friday.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.640
Whenever I was thinking about this, it
was this guy, he was talking about a

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.590
son and he, and he's playing baseball
and he says, my son doesn't like

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.050
losing, but he doesn't know how to win.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:33.120
I'm going to say this again.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:39.360
My son doesn't like losing, but
he doesn't know how to win because

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.820
I want to step out there again.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.850
And when I say step out there is,
I want to challenge you to do this.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:45.870
I've been there.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.440
I want to be a part of God's plan.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.689
I don't want to keep sitting where I'm
sitting, staying, where I'm staying, not

00:18:54.689 --> 00:18:56.010
following God the way he wants me to.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.760
I don't want to be there because it is not
a good place, but I don't know how to win.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.070
I don't know how to take a next step.

00:19:02.669 --> 00:19:04.320
I'm struggling with that.

00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:06.719
And many of you may be in that same place.

00:19:07.199 --> 00:19:09.629
Many other believers may be in that
same place, that many people who don't

00:19:09.629 --> 00:19:12.270
know Jesus, if you don't know Jesus,
if you've never given your life to

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.159
him, you may be at the same place.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.889
So how do we overcome that?

00:19:17.985 --> 00:19:20.025
Well, I love how Joshua
answers this force.

00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:20.295
Right?

00:19:20.415 --> 00:19:22.335
You're wondering am I
actually preaching the word?

00:19:22.335 --> 00:19:23.625
I would love to say the answer's.

00:19:23.625 --> 00:19:23.925
Yes.

00:19:23.925 --> 00:19:25.125
And that's why I want
to go back to the word.

00:19:25.275 --> 00:19:27.045
How does Joshua teaches this?

00:19:27.045 --> 00:19:27.405
Right?

00:19:27.495 --> 00:19:28.755
How does he answer this question?

00:19:28.755 --> 00:19:31.635
Number one, we see that it
started with him being faithful.

00:19:31.635 --> 00:19:36.255
So if you study the word of God, Joshua
ends up being around Moses consistently.

00:19:36.255 --> 00:19:36.825
What did he do?

00:19:37.035 --> 00:19:40.935
He started following God and he
started following God's man, which

00:19:40.935 --> 00:19:42.525
means somebody who is following Jesus.

00:19:42.795 --> 00:19:46.065
He started, or God, in essence, he
was trying to say, Hey, how does it.

00:19:46.815 --> 00:19:48.675
What does it look like
to communicate with God?

00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:50.925
So we started following God.

00:19:51.585 --> 00:19:53.865
His past experience has
showed that commitment.

00:19:54.315 --> 00:19:57.645
And then what did he do when the
opportunity presented itself to get in the

00:19:57.645 --> 00:20:01.545
game and lead the charge to win a battle,
to get in part of the mission of God?

00:20:01.845 --> 00:20:06.735
He said, yes, he didn't say to
someone else it didn't sit down

00:20:06.735 --> 00:20:08.715
and say, no, I'm not good enough.

00:20:08.715 --> 00:20:09.765
I'm not qualified enough.

00:20:10.545 --> 00:20:11.325
He said, no.

00:20:13.294 --> 00:20:14.764
And I love this one step.

00:20:14.925 --> 00:20:16.264
I heard this from pastor Johnny Hunt.

00:20:16.264 --> 00:20:20.855
I've listened to it and said this before
one step or one act of obedience is

00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:22.264
better than years of studying about it.

00:20:23.794 --> 00:20:26.195
Many of us sit here and
say, I don't like losing.

00:20:27.395 --> 00:20:31.685
I don't like not getting involved
in the mission because I know I want

00:20:31.685 --> 00:20:36.395
to, but many of us study about it
and we study about it and we sent it

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:39.705
sermons and we sit under sermons and
we listened to podcasts and we sit in.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:46.650
And we never take that one step or
one act of obedience to say yes, yes.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.170
Now there's still more steps after.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:49.650
Yes.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.980
Well, one of the coolest parts is when
we talk about being better together,

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:57.810
God's created the body of Christ to work
together, to build one another up to help

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.210
take the next step of what happens after.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:00.750
Yes.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.010
What did Moses do?

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.480
Joshua said yes.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.360
And Moses said go collect men.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.370
And he says, go battle again.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.399
And so he went and so that's what we do.

00:21:11.399 --> 00:21:13.560
We start taking these steps of faith.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:14.520
Right.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:15.960
And he took people with them.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.230
I love that idea guys, when we say,
yes, don't forget, God's called you

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.730
to take somebody with you as well.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.649
So where has God called you?

00:21:22.889 --> 00:21:26.490
It could be your job, your
home, your city, who was God

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.500
called you to take with you?

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.240
I don't want to make this statement.

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:35.220
It's not, if it's not what who
has, you know, maybe God has

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.810
called you to know God who is God.

00:21:37.905 --> 00:21:39.075
And where has God calling him?

00:21:39.525 --> 00:21:42.405
So let's look at some other
people in this story, we're going

00:21:42.405 --> 00:21:43.815
to read verses 11 through 13.

00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:49.425
So we see while Moses held up his hand,
Israel prevailed, but whenever he put his

00:21:49.425 --> 00:21:53.775
hand down amyloid prevailed and when Moses
hands grew heavy, they took the stone and

00:21:53.775 --> 00:21:55.635
put it under him and he sat down on it.

00:21:55.635 --> 00:21:58.515
And then Aaron and her supported his
hands one on one side and one on the

00:21:58.515 --> 00:22:02.145
other side, so that his hands remained
steady until the sun went down.

00:22:02.745 --> 00:22:05.595
And so Joshua defeated
Amalek and the army with.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.310
So not only did God use Joshua
and the army to defeat the

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.370
enemy, he used these guys.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.880
So let me ask this question in this story
that we're seeing here, we're reading.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.760
Could any of the guys mentioned
one, the battle alone.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.490
So Josh would just went by himself.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.270
You think you could have won now if
Moses went up on the hill, as arms

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:31.430
would have fell, and I know this, so
you guys know that I am preaching.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.010
Without God, none of this would have
succeeded and yes, God could have

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.210
used one of them to defeat them.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:41.460
But God had a plan to use everyone God's
design and plan to fulfill his mission.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:47.350
His us, he chose us his greatest
creation to be a part of that.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.210
So let's look at Moses.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.950
Moses was the leader of Israel, right?

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.840
He's the one that led
the people out of Egypt.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.760
He communicated with God personally,
and then he interceded for the people.

00:22:58.919 --> 00:23:00.240
He was faithful in his call.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.300
We see Aaron, the brother of Moses,
God gave him to be an assistant

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.409
to help communicate because Moses
had complained that he couldn't

00:23:07.409 --> 00:23:08.459
be able to communicate well.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.830
And so he helped Moses
communicate to the people.

00:23:11.399 --> 00:23:12.179
And it was interesting.

00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:17.159
God actually makes Aaron later on
him and his, his, um, lineage or

00:23:17.159 --> 00:23:19.919
his people behind him will actually
be the priests of the temple.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.659
Then we see her.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.719
And as we begin to study, there's
not much mention about her other

00:23:24.719 --> 00:23:26.570
than this really where he was.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.880
Of this, and it was an
important part of this.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:30.300
Right?

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.060
And so we see Moses's role was
to go up on the hill, hold up

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.290
the staff that God had given him.

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:36.900
And when he couldn't hold a name,
more, the army would lose the battle.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.360
But Aaron and her's role
was to support Moses.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.870
They were there a long time
assistant till the sun went down.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.990
And so why did Moses hold up the staff?

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.100
I want to talk about this for a second.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:47.970
Why did Moses hold upset?

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.490
Number one, it was God's
number two, many believers.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:51.450
You begin to look at this.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.090
Prayer was done with hands-on.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:55.800
So, what did Moses do?

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.550
He went up on the mountain.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:01.050
He began to pray because he began to
inner seed for the battle that was

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.600
going on for the Lord to win the battle.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:09.149
And his battle was the battle was
really won in prayer that it was

00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:12.149
really one in prayer, but there were
so many people that were a part of

00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:13.560
this Aaron and her supporting him.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:13.830
Right.

00:24:14.879 --> 00:24:15.840
So what happened?

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.230
Right?

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.430
Joshua won the battle.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.120
So I want to ask this question out
of all five different people again.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.179
We're going to talk about God a
little bit more here, but out of

00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:27.960
Joshua, the army, Moses, Aaron, and
her, which one was more important.

00:24:33.439 --> 00:24:34.850
You think you could rate them one to five?

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.550
They're all important.

00:24:38.419 --> 00:24:43.429
See, too many times we look at
Moses, the leader, the one with

00:24:43.429 --> 00:24:44.510
the staff put his hands up.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.470
He's the most important, right?

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:46.460
Nope.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.790
Now we look at he's this Joshua,
I mean, he's leading the.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:51.720
He's gotta be.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:52.020
Nope.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:52.860
Nope.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.340
What about the whole important guess?

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.899
We're all important.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.990
And we just said, without everybody
there's failure, obviously God can

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.600
do anything he wants, but in this
essence, if one of them doesn't

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.190
hold up an arm, does the army loose?

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.370
I want to challenge you guys in this.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:17.820
As I began to read through the story,
and I know we have a group of people

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.060
in here that are not here physically
every week, part of inspiring hope

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:24.990
church, but I believe this is a factor
wherever you live and wherever you

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.030
serve and wherever you attend church.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.900
But I started thinking about this
just for instance, This makes

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.340
me think about us as a church.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.850
I couldn't help see this connection
as we are battling against the

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.260
enemy to start this church.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:41.220
Cause I guarantee this, we are
battling against the enemy because we

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.180
are starting a church that is going
to glorify Christ and make him known

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.950
around our city and around the world.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:49.800
That is something that means
we're starting to fight.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:50.430
We're in a.

00:25:51.495 --> 00:25:54.554
It takes us all working to,
at gathered to win the battle.

00:25:54.615 --> 00:25:56.175
It takes us all working
together to win the battle.

00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:57.524
Here's our strategy.

00:25:57.524 --> 00:26:00.225
So you guys know if you're saying, Hey,
what's your strategy to win the battle?

00:26:00.405 --> 00:26:02.324
Have you guys planned and prepared?

00:26:02.324 --> 00:26:03.405
How did you prepare for it?

00:26:03.405 --> 00:26:06.915
Well, yes, we did our strategy to
fulfill the mission that God has

00:26:06.915 --> 00:26:09.014
called assist to follow Jesus.

00:26:09.225 --> 00:26:11.504
Number one, that's what
we're going to point people.

00:26:11.504 --> 00:26:12.495
That's where we're going to start.

00:26:12.495 --> 00:26:14.145
It comes with a personal issue with Jesus.

00:26:14.145 --> 00:26:15.915
We're going to challenge
each other to follow Jesus.

00:26:16.094 --> 00:26:17.625
We're going to live in community.

00:26:17.625 --> 00:26:18.495
That's our second thing.

00:26:18.705 --> 00:26:19.875
Why do we live in community?

00:26:19.875 --> 00:26:20.385
Because we're better.

00:26:21.419 --> 00:26:23.040
We are better together.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.159
We understand God designed the body
of Christ, not just an individual

00:26:26.159 --> 00:26:29.490
issue with God, but the body of
Christ to grow one another up to

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:30.870
challenge and encourage one another.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:32.280
How do we fulfill that?

00:26:32.399 --> 00:26:36.600
Well, one of the ways we fulfill that
is we give space in this, this group.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.649
If you wonder why we had five.

00:26:38.235 --> 00:26:40.725
Or so in between service,
we want to build community.

00:26:40.965 --> 00:26:43.155
Why do we have something called
inspire groups in the week?

00:26:43.275 --> 00:26:45.555
Because we want to build community
and we want to live in community.

00:26:45.795 --> 00:26:47.715
Why do we do life together?

00:26:47.715 --> 00:26:50.295
Where we invite people over
for dinner or lunch, because

00:26:50.295 --> 00:26:51.615
we want to do life together.

00:26:52.005 --> 00:26:53.955
How are we going to defeat the enemy?

00:26:54.855 --> 00:26:56.145
We're going to follow Jesus.

00:26:56.505 --> 00:26:59.325
We're going to live in community and
we're going to serve those around us.

00:26:59.535 --> 00:27:01.875
See, as we get around each
other and as we follow Jesus,

00:27:01.875 --> 00:27:05.205
we are so driven to go surfing.

00:27:06.045 --> 00:27:09.675
Not only in our community, through
our surf Sundays or just through our

00:27:09.675 --> 00:27:12.945
local projects, but to serve those
around us, as we see needs in our

00:27:13.095 --> 00:27:15.615
neighborhood, as we see needs in the
lives of those around us, we begin

00:27:15.615 --> 00:27:19.335
to meet those needs because again,
following Jesus drives us to live in

00:27:19.335 --> 00:27:21.165
community and drives us into serving our.

00:27:22.095 --> 00:27:23.895
But ultimately we want to
see God's kingdom expand it.

00:27:23.895 --> 00:27:25.335
And we believe if we
do those three things.

00:27:25.845 --> 00:27:28.784
If we follow Jesus, we live in
community and we serve those around us.

00:27:28.784 --> 00:27:30.284
We'll start seeing God's kingdom expanded.

00:27:30.524 --> 00:27:33.794
We'll start seeing a lot of us get
more involved in inviting people

00:27:33.794 --> 00:27:39.825
to church, sharing the gospel with
people, discipling people, seeing other

00:27:39.825 --> 00:27:43.485
inspired groups start because the desire
to reach more people and ultimately

00:27:43.485 --> 00:27:45.284
we'll see more churches planted.

00:27:46.185 --> 00:27:47.595
It sounds like, oh gosh.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.590
You know, that sounds systematic.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:50.250
We're going to figure this out.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.520
We've took taking the Bible out
of actually we've put the Bible

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.030
into everything we do because we
understand without the word of

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:02.010
God, without the power of God, our
mission and our strategy is useless.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.750
And we'll see this in Moses story,
Moses understood that they would

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.649
have not won the battle without the
Lord's power, but they all had a role.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.870
And so do we, we all have a role.

00:28:13.379 --> 00:28:15.540
So I want us to work
together for just a second.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:15.810
Think about.

00:28:16.935 --> 00:28:19.635
How can you, so this is going to be
personal, even if you're not a part

00:28:19.635 --> 00:28:25.274
of inspiring hope, how can you go and
fulfill the mission wherever you are?

00:28:25.274 --> 00:28:27.645
How do you get ma let me ask it this way.

00:28:27.645 --> 00:28:29.834
Cause I want to ask it the way I wrote
it, because it made me more sense.

00:28:30.165 --> 00:28:33.314
How can you be a part of
helping people win the battle?

00:28:33.764 --> 00:28:37.875
How can you be a part of helping win
the battle and defeat the enemy based

00:28:37.875 --> 00:28:39.794
upon the strategy of our church?

00:28:40.064 --> 00:28:41.024
Because you can take that anywhere you go.

00:28:41.024 --> 00:28:42.794
How can you be a part
of winning the battle?

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:53.810
Pray for each other.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:54.470
Good.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:55.340
Let's keep going.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:57.440
Build relationships.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:58.040
Okay.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:58.490
Keep going.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:09.230
This does apply to those who aren't
part of inspiring hope you can do this.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.230
Courage, one other.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.830
That's great.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:16.400
Love it.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.010
I'm going to keep waiting.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.790
We're going to keep going.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.040
What does that follow Jesus.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.050
Hey, you're starting
to get the drift here.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:30.460
Yes.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.800
Come on.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:33.820
What else?

00:29:40.825 --> 00:29:41.725
Being a good listener.

00:29:42.445 --> 00:29:43.675
Okay, good.

00:29:48.135 --> 00:29:48.705
One more.

00:29:53.165 --> 00:29:53.435
Yeah.

00:29:53.795 --> 00:29:55.745
Building base Larisha is
getting to know one another.

00:29:55.805 --> 00:29:57.035
Yes, absolutely.

00:29:57.995 --> 00:30:01.475
So I asked this question, do
you want to please God, or.

00:30:03.764 --> 00:30:05.955
You said yes, majority of you, right?

00:30:06.014 --> 00:30:10.365
You want to be a part of the
mission of God and you start

00:30:10.365 --> 00:30:11.534
wondering, where do I start?

00:30:11.565 --> 00:30:12.435
What does it look like?

00:30:13.754 --> 00:30:16.425
Well, one way for us, and I'm
just gonna kind of walk through

00:30:16.425 --> 00:30:18.465
this is to follow Jesus, right?

00:30:19.065 --> 00:30:19.725
It's a simple way.

00:30:19.935 --> 00:30:22.425
You want to be a part of
expanding God's kingdom and being

00:30:22.425 --> 00:30:23.264
a part of the mission of God.

00:30:23.264 --> 00:30:25.034
Follow Jesus, follow Jesus.

00:30:25.425 --> 00:30:26.625
What should that challenge you to do?

00:30:26.685 --> 00:30:28.905
It should challenge you as you
follow Jesus to live in communes.

00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:30.240
Guarantee.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.780
If you're following Jesus alone and
you do not get involved in community,

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:39.360
there's probably something broken in
that relationship, but it should right.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.139
Lead you to community.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.520
And as you're in community, it
should drive you to serve others.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:48.540
And as you serve others, it should
drive you to share Jesus with others.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.429
I want to challenge you with this.

00:30:50.429 --> 00:30:52.709
God does not save you from something.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:55.730
He saves you for something.

00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:58.370
And specifically for
someone I'm gonna say that.

00:31:00.565 --> 00:31:05.065
God is not only save you from
something, he saves you for something.

00:31:06.235 --> 00:31:09.775
And for someone there is someone
I'm going to say it again.

00:31:09.805 --> 00:31:13.645
There's someone waiting for you on
the other side of your obedience,

00:31:14.515 --> 00:31:16.885
there's someone waiting on you
on the other side of your neck.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.899
So many times we think we have
to have it all figured out.

00:31:19.899 --> 00:31:23.110
I spent a year in church
trying to get my life right.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:24.340
And get it all figured out.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.810
And what I figure out, I was never going
to get there without surrendering and

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:33.850
taking the next step where I am today
is one next step after one next step.

00:31:33.879 --> 00:31:37.149
And it's probably a thousand next steps
that I've taken to get to where I am.

00:31:37.149 --> 00:31:40.240
And I'll tell you this, I am not
done because God has more for me.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.770
I want to be a part of the mission of God.

00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:46.545
And I'm going to continue to say yes,
And I'm going to continue to look

00:31:46.545 --> 00:31:51.195
and say, God, what more can I do the
follow you to be a part of the mission

00:31:51.675 --> 00:31:54.524
that you have challenged us to be as a
church and as an individual believer?

00:31:56.284 --> 00:32:01.885
Yes, that's what we had to do is
yes, I started thinking about this.

00:32:01.915 --> 00:32:03.655
We need to stop just going to church.

00:32:03.925 --> 00:32:09.175
When you start being the church
guys, going to church, it's a

00:32:09.175 --> 00:32:12.085
small part of being the church.

00:32:12.685 --> 00:32:15.000
And so, you know, Please
come back next week.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:15.750
I love you guys.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:19.350
I mean, I want you to be part of
the church like coming, but I would

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:23.490
love to start seeing all of us be
the church, because if we'll be the

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.920
church will continue to come in here.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.350
Like we did this morning
at our nine o'clock time.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.380
We do a prayer time before our team
goes and gets ready for serving.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.950
And we start hearing these
stories of gospel conversations

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:36.810
and dinners with families.

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:38.580
I want to hear more of that.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.460
I believe God's called us to hear more.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:46.260
So the question is how do we take, how do
we have the faith to take the next step?

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:52.920
I love how this text ends, as we see
where Moses reminds us to remember.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.580
And if you guys have been around
inspiring hope over the last couple

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.400
of weeks, we have challenged each
other to not forget to remember.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:03.390
And we've challenged ourselves what
to remember because it's powerful.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.190
So here's what Moses says.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:08.580
It says, then the Lord said to
Moses, write down on this scroll as a

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.010
reminder, and to recite it to Jo, John.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.410
And I will completely blot out the
memory of the ambula under heaven and

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:17.850
Moses built an altar and named it.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:21.810
The Lord is my banner and he said, indeed,
my hand is lifted up towards the Lord's

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:25.890
throne and the Lord will be at war with
analyte from generation to generation.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:30.450
So God told Moses to write down
what happened to remind Joshua.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:34.950
Here's what I do know as Joshua began
to lead the people of Israel after

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:38.900
Moses passed away, Joshua needed this.

00:33:40.455 --> 00:33:43.875
The God what God had done
and what God was going to do.

00:33:45.074 --> 00:33:50.625
We need to remember what God has told
us what God has done, what he's going

00:33:50.625 --> 00:33:56.534
to do, because I'm telling you every
time I get the opportunity to stop and

00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:58.965
remember what God's done in my life.

00:33:59.084 --> 00:34:03.645
All gosh, all man, I want to be a
part of God's mission in the future.

00:34:04.665 --> 00:34:06.885
That's what Moses is reminding us.

00:34:07.544 --> 00:34:08.444
Don't forget to remember.

00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:11.610
Don't forget to remember
what God has done for you.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.540
And when we look at each person in
this text, no one was more important

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.750
than the other, their faith and
obedience is what mattered the most.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.890
So it doesn't matter
your role in God's army.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.180
It doesn't matter if you're the
one that is holding up your arms.

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:30.850
If you're leading the army, if
you're holding someone else's arms

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.720
up, the, the most important role
is the role that God's called you

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.670
to, to be a part of a filling the.

00:34:38.315 --> 00:34:39.455
I'll challenge you with this.

00:34:39.995 --> 00:34:42.665
If you're trying to be somebody else,
you'll only be a second rate someone

00:34:42.665 --> 00:34:46.174
else, but if you'll be what God's called
you to be, you'll be a first rate.

00:34:46.174 --> 00:34:47.525
You there's no one else.

00:34:47.525 --> 00:34:48.094
That can be that.

00:34:49.264 --> 00:34:49.955
There's no one else.

00:34:49.955 --> 00:34:50.525
That can be that.

00:34:52.955 --> 00:34:58.265
So as we conclude today, as we kind
of finish this up, I want us to think

00:34:58.265 --> 00:35:00.845
about this as we move forward as
a church, not only inspiring hope,

00:35:00.845 --> 00:35:02.585
but as a church, wherever you go.

00:35:04.055 --> 00:35:05.855
I want us all to be careful to give God.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:11.370
And the victories that we'll experience
and taking that next step, whatever it is.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:13.980
So the question is,
what is your next step?

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.190
You won't be surprised
where I'll say it starts.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.720
It starts with a relationship with Jesus.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:20.880
If you've never given your life to Jesus.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.230
Today is the day to give your life
to Jesus, to start fulfilling the

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.430
call that God has on your life.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:27.930
That's where it starts.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.250
Now, let me challenge you this.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.890
If you've given your life to
Jesus, maybe today is today to

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:33.450
recommit to that relationship.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:34.260
Maybe your life.

00:35:35.444 --> 00:35:38.505
We'll have days then it's
weeks then it's months.

00:35:38.505 --> 00:35:42.015
So maybe it's been years where you
haven't had that daily time with the Lord.

00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.665
Today is the day to say I'm done.

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:47.745
I'm going to commit to start
there to start having that daily

00:35:47.745 --> 00:35:52.575
relationship again, through the word,
through prayer with other people

00:35:52.575 --> 00:35:53.825
as well, because accountability.

00:35:55.509 --> 00:35:58.720
Second is maybe you've given your life
to Jesus, but you've never been baptized.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.069
Maybe you were baptized as a baby.

00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:02.140
And I know where we're here
more and more about that.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:03.100
I'm in this area.

00:36:03.299 --> 00:36:06.430
You're baptized as a baby before
you gave your life to Christ.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:07.960
Let me encourage you.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:13.509
The word says, but that's a
great dedication, but it is not a

00:36:13.509 --> 00:36:14.799
public profession of your faith.

00:36:15.585 --> 00:36:17.895
So baptism is part of
that public profession.

00:36:17.895 --> 00:36:20.385
Maybe that's your next step that
you just need to say, Hey, I need to

00:36:20.385 --> 00:36:23.325
be baptized because I've never been
baptized after I gave my life to Christ.

00:36:23.565 --> 00:36:26.805
That's a great next step, because
you'll be amazed what God does

00:36:26.805 --> 00:36:28.155
from that one step of obedience.

00:36:28.395 --> 00:36:31.425
Once of obedience will give you
more confidence to take the next

00:36:31.425 --> 00:36:32.775
step and then the next step.

00:36:32.775 --> 00:36:35.415
And the next thing you know, God will
do great and mighty things through you.

00:36:35.415 --> 00:36:37.575
Not because of you, but
because of your faithfulness.

00:36:38.265 --> 00:36:41.385
And I love this scripture, God
will do exceedingly abundantly

00:36:41.385 --> 00:36:42.615
more than you can ask her things.

00:36:44.759 --> 00:36:47.069
Through one step or act of faith.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:51.380
So maybe it's baptism for some of you.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:55.190
It could just be taking the next steps
like this, go to the next steps lunch.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:57.650
We moved it from this week to next week.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:58.520
What's the next steps launch.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.790
That's a place where you get to talk with
me and a couple of other people about,

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.590
Hey, what would be a great next step?

00:37:04.305 --> 00:37:05.444
Maybe you're a lot like me.

00:37:05.475 --> 00:37:08.714
I don't know what it is, but we
put people around us to do that.

00:37:08.774 --> 00:37:10.274
So I want to help you take that next step.

00:37:10.305 --> 00:37:12.404
Maybe it's that maybe it's being
a part of an inspire group.

00:37:12.884 --> 00:37:13.634
I don't know what it is.

00:37:13.634 --> 00:37:14.415
Maybe that's your next step.

00:37:14.415 --> 00:37:18.285
Maybe it's being a member of
inspiring hope for some of you.

00:37:18.285 --> 00:37:21.705
It really could just be surrendering
a call to a deeper walk in your faith.

00:37:22.754 --> 00:37:25.785
Again, I would not doubt
if today's message.

00:37:26.955 --> 00:37:27.944
Some of you go.

00:37:29.835 --> 00:37:33.495
I'm good, but you may have heard me say,
Hey, how committed are you to the mission?

00:37:33.495 --> 00:37:34.965
And you may have rated yourself a seven.

00:37:37.215 --> 00:37:37.875
You could be an eight.

00:37:39.855 --> 00:37:40.785
So maybe that's you today.

00:37:40.815 --> 00:37:41.085
Maybe.

00:37:41.085 --> 00:37:42.225
What, what is that next step?

00:37:42.255 --> 00:37:43.215
I'm just gonna challenge you to this.

00:37:43.215 --> 00:37:45.405
Maybe you need to start
sharing Jesus more.

00:37:46.245 --> 00:37:49.725
Maybe it's you need to start discipling
someone because we're better together.

00:37:51.255 --> 00:37:52.515
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
challenge you out here.

00:37:52.515 --> 00:37:55.365
I want you to begin asking
yourself this question.

00:37:55.365 --> 00:37:57.525
Maybe I'm going to be part
of another church plan.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.770
Maybe God is calling you
to step up and step out.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:05.580
And yes, I know I'm talking to some
of our members here and here's in

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.860
here saying, Hey, Ben, don't you want
me to be a part of this church plan?

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:13.290
Not more than, I want you to be faithful
to the call that God has on you.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.840
And if that's to be a part of
another church plant, I will

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:22.740
celebrate because it is what God is
calling you to, to what is it guys?

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.180
This is why we come here to be
challenging our faith to go live it out.

00:38:28.634 --> 00:38:29.805
Now, because this is the end.

00:38:29.805 --> 00:38:33.495
All, this is the, what I would call
the prayer room, the room where

00:38:33.495 --> 00:38:37.185
we start working together to spur
one another off to good works.

00:38:37.755 --> 00:38:39.705
And then we go and we attempt.

00:38:40.575 --> 00:38:43.755
And it's that challenge that I remind,
I can't remember who say to this, but

00:38:43.905 --> 00:38:48.765
we want to expect great things from God,
but I'm challenging you, this God wants

00:38:48.765 --> 00:38:50.805
you to attempt great things for him.

00:38:52.695 --> 00:38:54.975
Don't say no for God.

00:38:55.035 --> 00:38:56.585
Because a lot of times we say
no, because we don't know.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.110
Say yes.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:00.780
Be willing to risk whatever
God's calling you to do.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.190
Here's what I promise you, staying where
you are, where you are, is not an option.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:12.660
God's not called you to be saved and to
be sitting here for the rest of your life.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.300
If that was true, God
would have saved you.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:19.050
And he would have taken you at that
moment, but he says you still have

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.510
something to do to be a part of.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.550
And it's through a personal
relationship with me.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:26.070
And as I lead you.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.590
You will go.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.740
I don't know what your next step is.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:32.940
I'd love to be a part of it.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:37.020
If you have questions, if you want to give
your life to Jesus during this time of

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.280
invitation, I'm going to stay in the back.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.640
And I stay in the back because this,
if you don't know Jesus, or you don't

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.490
know what your next step is, if you
need prayer, I want to be a part of it.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:48.330
I'm here to encourage and lead
you through the word of God,

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.640
to a relationship with Jesus.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.800
No matter if you already have
one or not to pursue that.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.160
So, let me be a part of it.

00:39:55.819 --> 00:39:58.609
So during this time of invitation,
what we're doing each week now is

00:39:58.609 --> 00:40:02.209
we're trying to give you time to
consider or reflect on the message.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.660
So here in a moment after I pray,
I want you to just take some time.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.649
You can either how your heads and pray
you can get on your knees and pray.

00:40:09.649 --> 00:40:11.600
You can pray with someone else,
or you can come talk to me.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:17.660
That's your time to reflect and say,
God, what are you asking me to do?

00:40:19.215 --> 00:40:22.095
Then after we get an opportunity
to reflect, we're going to end

00:40:22.095 --> 00:40:26.565
today's service and praise or we'll
stand and worship God for allowing

00:40:26.565 --> 00:40:28.575
us to be a part of his work.

00:40:30.135 --> 00:40:31.845
Cause I'm so thankful for God's word.

00:40:32.055 --> 00:40:35.595
And I'm so thankful for our relationship
with Jesus and that challenge you today.

00:40:35.955 --> 00:40:37.635
Don't miss the opportunity.

00:40:38.595 --> 00:40:39.765
Say yes to Jesus.

00:40:40.935 --> 00:40:42.075
Let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:40:42.075 --> 00:40:42.975
We love you Lord.

00:40:43.575 --> 00:40:47.865
And we know that your word is
timeless and Lord, I am so thankful.

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:57.600
For the example of Joshua and the
army and Moses and Aaron and her Lord.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.420
I always think of these stories as they
could have been something different.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:06.750
If they wouldn't have the faith
to say yes, Lord, you chose to use

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.930
these men after their obedience.

00:41:11.819 --> 00:41:16.799
God, I pray that your word convicts
us and reminds us that you want to

00:41:16.799 --> 00:41:20.490
do exceedingly abundantly more in
our lives if we'll just surrender.

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:24.210
So Lord, I pray if there's someone
in this room that doesn't know you

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:27.240
personally, that doesn't have a personal
issue with you, Lord, they don't leave

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.259
today without making that secure Lord.

00:41:31.259 --> 00:41:34.109
I pray that they come back and they
talk with me or they talk with one of

00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:35.970
our other members here in our church.

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:37.290
Lord, they begin to take that.

00:41:38.235 --> 00:41:39.825
The Lord, I even want to step further.

00:41:40.065 --> 00:41:43.725
I believe God, you are speaking
to every person in this room.

00:41:44.205 --> 00:41:48.165
Lord, every person is designed to be
here today because you brought them

00:41:48.165 --> 00:41:50.475
here to hear the message from you.

00:41:51.285 --> 00:41:56.595
Lord, I pray that they are challenged to
say yes to their next step of faith and

00:41:56.595 --> 00:41:59.895
may you get glory and may they experience
your presence along the journey?

00:42:00.915 --> 00:42:02.475
And so Lord, we just pray
this in your heavenly name.

00:42:04.155 --> 00:42:04.395
Mm,
