00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.090
Did

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.460
everybody have a good July
4th weekend this past weekend?

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.180
Anybody?

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.970
Yeah, I know I did.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.050
We went to Kings island.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.890
It was here's the crazy thing
you would expect Kings island

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.170
to be like packed on July 4th.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.690
The parking lot looked packed,
but we got in and like most of

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.620
the rides were really quick.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.960
So, um, yeah, it was great.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.830
We enjoyed it.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.950
Um, and excited about this
week, cuz it has been.

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:33.885
If any of you have been outside here,
it's been like in the eighties, you know,

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:35.295
upper eighties, you can't beat that.

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:40.485
So, um, anyway, so we are
going to be in Luke chapter 15

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:42.435
today, starting in verse 11.

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:44.715
If you wanna turn there, we'll
also have it up on the screen.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.525
If you don't have it.

00:00:45.614 --> 00:00:47.085
Here's my encouragement for you.

00:00:47.215 --> 00:00:50.275
If you don't have a copy of God's word,
which is totally fine, because I didn't,

00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:53.635
um, for the longest time back at our
next steps table, you can grab a Bible on

00:00:53.635 --> 00:00:57.115
your way out if you don't like carrying
around a Bible and you're saying, Hey,

00:00:57.145 --> 00:00:58.345
I need something a little lighter.

00:00:59.005 --> 00:00:59.335
Great.

00:00:59.335 --> 00:01:00.115
You got your phone.

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:02.995
So I encourage you to grab a
Bible app, um, go out to the

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:04.705
app store search Bible app.

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:06.625
Um, I use the U version Bible app.

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:08.545
It's a great one to take
with you wherever you go.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:14.150
Um, but anyways, um, Luke chapter 15,
Starting in verse 11, most of us will

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.160
know this story of the prodigal sun.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.810
Um, but wanted to look at this
today again, um, I was thinking

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.000
through, what would we talk about?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.690
What we preach about?

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.600
We just got done with the sermon
series over the book of first Timothy.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.450
And so right now we're just doing
individual messages each and every week.

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:32.205
and so the cool part is we
get to jump into this message.

00:01:32.205 --> 00:01:33.675
So I wanna start off by asking questions.

00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:35.235
I love asking questions.

00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:38.955
This gets you guys hopefully engaged
a little bit, um, in, in some things.

00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:44.354
So anybody ever, uh, thought you knew
better than your parents, like your

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:48.014
parents would tell you something and
you go, no, I think I know better.

00:01:49.545 --> 00:01:53.985
Good chance that the majority
and current students here, uh,

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:55.695
would probably say yes to that.

00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:56.145
Right?

00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:57.705
Most of us would say yes to that.

00:01:58.095 --> 00:01:59.295
Um, let me ask another question.

00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:00.525
This is gonna veer off a little bit.

00:02:00.914 --> 00:02:04.995
Have you ever thought, could I ever be
forgiven of something I've ever done?

00:02:05.414 --> 00:02:07.485
You know, something that you've done
in your life that was horrible, or

00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:08.985
maybe something that you did as a kid?

00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:10.335
And you're just like,
could I ever be forgiven?

00:02:10.335 --> 00:02:11.565
Like could my parents forgive me?

00:02:11.655 --> 00:02:12.675
Could God forgive me?

00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:14.085
Maybe you haven't had that.

00:02:14.085 --> 00:02:15.255
I know I've had that in my life.

00:02:15.675 --> 00:02:17.505
Let me, let me ask another tough question.

00:02:18.345 --> 00:02:20.775
Have you ever asked, how could
someone ever forgive this

00:02:20.775 --> 00:02:21.825
person for what they've done?

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:25.485
Or maybe how could God ever forgive
this person for murdering this person

00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:26.805
or forever doing this to this person?

00:02:27.225 --> 00:02:29.565
I know I've been that way where
I've looked at people and I go,

00:02:29.565 --> 00:02:30.795
how could God ever forgive them?

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.405
Or, or how could I ever forgive
them for what they've done to me?

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:34.515
That's tough.

00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:40.065
Um, last one, I wanna ask you ever
ever said, Hey, that's not fair that

00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:41.445
they got two cookies and I got one.

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:43.485
I mean, maybe it's not just cookies.

00:02:43.905 --> 00:02:44.835
You ever thought.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.830
Man I follow after Jesus.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.170
Maybe that's what your, your father
of Christ and you go, I follow after

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.400
Jesus and, and, uh, I don't have that,
but man, they don't and they have

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.900
this and they have this great life.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.520
Why would God allow that to happen?

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.800
Why, you know, you've
gotten jealous a little bit.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.620
Those are some of the things we're
gonna talk through today because

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.350
this story really points to a lot of
these things that we just brought up

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.530
is these things in our lives that we
have struggled with where we begin

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.770
to question our parents, or we begin
to struggle to wonder if we could be

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:15.090
forgiven or, or could we forgive someone
or, you know, so, so on and so forth.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.950
And so this story today, the prodigal
son really depicts, um, the story of.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.079
Two brothers and one father.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.720
And if you wanna look at the story, this
is typically the way we look at the story.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.829
The, the father in the story is gonna be
recognized as God for us, as we look at

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.290
this picture, and then you've got the two
brothers, his sons that typically we look

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.730
at and, uh, we, we wanna be thankful for
the one of the younger brother, right?

00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:40.049
Because the father forgives him.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.079
But we also look at the older
brother and we really wanna be

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.280
judgmental of the older brother.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.330
But I've even found in this story, cuz
I've read this story so many times that

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.400
I've actually kind of questioned each
one of the people in the story, even the

00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:56.490
father in the story, because I'm like,
how could the father forgive him for that?

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.700
Um, and so anyways, I say that I
want you to understand how the story

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.560
depicts this story, um, in this.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.280
But, um, as we look into this story, um, I
want us to think about this, that we will.

00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:10.605
Find yourself somewhere in this story.

00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:16.214
And as we do, I, I would challenge you
today to go home and evaluate who you are

00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:21.524
and maybe what area of your life that you
need to, uh, change or turn from today.

00:04:21.524 --> 00:04:23.325
And so my challenge for you
is to open your heart, be

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.585
ready for God to speak to you.

00:04:24.585 --> 00:04:27.435
And because of that, I wanna take some
time to pray and ask God to do that.

00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:27.855
So let's pray.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.169
Lord Jesus.

00:04:29.174 --> 00:04:29.919
We thank you Lord.

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.450
For today, Lord, we pray for our hearts
to be open our minds, to be open Lord that

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.440
you speak through this word that you speak
through this message, uh, to reveal to us

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.010
Lord what we need to apply to our lives,
uh, to change our lives and to challenge

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.840
us to live, uh, more and more like you.

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:45.429
And so we pray this in your heavily name.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.239
Amen.

00:04:47.175 --> 00:04:49.815
So before we jump into this text,
we've gotta start with actually the

00:04:49.815 --> 00:04:52.185
first couple of verses in chapter 15.

00:04:52.185 --> 00:04:57.435
And the reason why is if we don't,
we'll miss the context of this message.

00:04:57.435 --> 00:05:00.585
And so let's read the first two verses,
which may not be up on the screen, cuz

00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:03.015
I didn't tell him to put the two first
two verses of 15 in there, but it says

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.215
this in verse or chapter 15 of Luke,
it says all the tax collectors and

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:09.555
sinners were approaching to listen to.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.909
Speaking of Jesus and the Pharisees
and scribes were complaining this man

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.250
welcomes sinners and eats with him.

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.640
So as we look at this, we know
that there's tax collectors and

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.900
sinners that are listening to Jesus.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.710
Uh, first picture to me is this
is an amazing thing, right?

00:05:25.715 --> 00:05:29.549
These are people who need Jesus
are actually listening to Jesus.

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:30.090
Praise God.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.270
Right?

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.890
We wanna celebr.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.400
right.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.490
That, that we should celebrate,
because honestly, we're

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.840
probably part of that group.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.410
A lot of times when we're, we're really
coming and listening to Jesus, but there's

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.650
a group here that doesn't like it, and
it's really the religious leaders, right?

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.120
The religious leaders were complaining.

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:46.200
And why were they complaining?

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.990
Because Jesus welcomed these
sinners and ate with them.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.540
How, I mean, that's not a big deal.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.160
Should I be a big deal?

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.530
We have to understand
what the big deal is.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.330
These tax collectors, uh, as he labels
them, If you guys know much about

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.740
tax collectors in these days, these
tax collectors were Jews and these

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.700
religious leaders were Jews and tax
collectors would tax the Jews, their

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.070
own people for the Roman government.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.810
And they would typically take more than
what was even expected in taxes so that

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.460
they could get, make money off of it.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.450
But number two, here's the number two part
that the taxes in which they collected

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.340
from their own people would go to a
government who was suppressing them, who

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.350
was murdering them, putting them in jail.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.785
And so I'll tell you this,
a tax collector was like the

00:06:31.785 --> 00:06:33.675
worst of the worst of the worst.

00:06:33.975 --> 00:06:39.975
So for Jesus, a person who claimed to be
religious to sit and, and talk with these

00:06:39.975 --> 00:06:42.285
people and to eat with these people, man.

00:06:43.095 --> 00:06:44.115
They weren't very happy.

00:06:44.565 --> 00:06:46.635
So what would be a great
example for us today?

00:06:46.635 --> 00:06:48.885
And I'm gonna give you
a, a, a, some example.

00:06:48.945 --> 00:06:53.295
Sometimes my examples are horrible,
but just imagine this, that I was,

00:06:53.295 --> 00:06:54.615
of course, I'm not Jesus, by the way.

00:06:54.915 --> 00:07:00.135
But imagine your pastor was sitting
and eating with someone who was in your

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.895
family or your friends who consistently
stole from you and then gave that money.

00:07:05.895 --> 00:07:09.705
Some of that money to a government
or person who was suppressing.

00:07:10.545 --> 00:07:15.285
Was causing, uh, destruction in your
life was maybe killing some of your

00:07:15.285 --> 00:07:17.085
friends or putting them in jail.

00:07:17.175 --> 00:07:18.825
How happy would you be with me?

00:07:18.915 --> 00:07:21.495
If I was sitting that with that
person and just shooting the breeze?

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:23.835
I mean, I, I'm just being honest.

00:07:24.045 --> 00:07:27.435
I don't think you guys would be
happy me sitting with your enemy.

00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:30.825
Most of us wouldn't because
we would say, how dare you?

00:07:30.975 --> 00:07:32.385
Do you know what they've done to me?

00:07:32.955 --> 00:07:36.645
See, now we understand why
the Pharisees and the scribes.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.580
We're frustrated at this.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.040
Why would Jesus Sid with them?

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.330
But this story that we're gonna talk
about today will talk about not only their

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.930
hearts, but many times guys, our hearts.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.630
This is going to be a mirror
today, including myself.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.530
That at times we are very, very
judgemental on who God can save on who

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.870
God can forgive and who we can forgive.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.780
When we forget that we're in the group
of the centers and tax collectors.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.040
When we look at this story even more.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.830
So let's read at this story fully from,
uh, chap or verse 11 on through 32.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.930
So it says this, it says, he also
said, speaking of Jesus, a man had

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.830
two sons, the younger of them said to
his father, father, give me the share

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.450
of the estate I have coming to mean.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.270
So he distribute,
distributed the assets to.

00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:26.669
Not many days later, the younger son
gathered together all that he had and

00:08:26.674 --> 00:08:30.570
traveled to a distant country where he
squandered his estate in foolish living.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.590
After he had spent everything,
a severe famine struck the

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.569
country and he had nothing.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.340
I, I just wanna stop right there.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.530
When I read this, I go,
it was coming to him.

00:08:40.534 --> 00:08:40.799
Right.

00:08:40.804 --> 00:08:41.340
He deserved that.

00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:43.635
. I mean, that's my, my perspective.

00:08:44.145 --> 00:08:47.145
I'm maybe a little harsh with that,
but then he goes on and says, then he

00:08:47.145 --> 00:08:50.235
went to work for one of the citizens
of the country who sent him out

00:08:50.235 --> 00:08:52.094
into his fields to feed the pigs.

00:08:52.454 --> 00:08:55.875
And he longed to eat, to fill from
the paws that the pigs were eating,

00:08:56.385 --> 00:08:58.035
but no one would give him anything.

00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:02.175
And when he had came to his sense, he
said, how many of my father's hired

00:09:02.175 --> 00:09:04.665
workers have more than enough food?

00:09:04.785 --> 00:09:06.045
And here I'm dying of.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.950
I'll get up and go to my father and say to
him, father, I have sinned against heaven.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.220
And in your sight, I'm no longer
worthy to be called your son,

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.320
make me one of your hired workers.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.190
So we got up and he went to his
father, but while the son was still

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.640
a long way off, his father saw him
and was filled with compassion.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.450
he ran and threw his arms
around his neck and kissed him.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.090
And the son said to him, father,
I have sinned against heaven.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.240
And in your sight, I am no longer
worried to be called your son.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.200
But the father told a servants
quick, bring out the best robe, put

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.220
on, put it on him, put a ring on
his finger and sandals on his feet.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.140
Then bring the fat and cap and slaughter.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.170
And let's celebrate with the
feast because this son of mine

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.120
was dead and is alive again.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.550
He was lost and he is now found.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.200
So they begin to celebrate.

00:09:52.734 --> 00:09:55.464
And now his older son was in the field.

00:09:55.464 --> 00:09:58.584
And as he came near the house,
he heard dancing and music.

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:02.364
And so he summoned one of the servants
questioning what these things meant.

00:10:02.724 --> 00:10:03.564
Your brother is here.

00:10:03.564 --> 00:10:07.555
He told him your father has slaughtered
the fat and calf because he has him.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.339
Back safe and sound.

00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:13.420
And then the older brother became
angry and didn't want to go in.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.230
So his father came out and pleaded
with him, but he replied to his father.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.140
Look, I have been slaving
these many years for you.

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:22.000
I have never disobeyed your orders.

00:10:22.209 --> 00:10:25.900
You yet, you have never given me a goat
so that I could celebrate with my friends.

00:10:26.535 --> 00:10:30.614
But when this son of yours who has
devoured, devoured your assets with

00:10:30.614 --> 00:10:35.564
prostitutes, you slaughtered the fat and
calf for him and son, he said to him,

00:10:36.015 --> 00:10:40.395
you are always with me and everything I
have is yours, but we had to celebrate

00:10:40.395 --> 00:10:44.084
and rejoice because the brother of
yours was dead and is alive again.

00:10:44.145 --> 00:10:47.685
He was lost and now he has found.

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:54.795
So let's look at this, um, through the
eyes of each one of these guys, right?

00:10:54.795 --> 00:10:57.915
So the older brother, the younger
brother and the father, and as

00:10:57.915 --> 00:11:01.455
we walk through this, we're gonna
start talking about these, these

00:11:01.455 --> 00:11:03.045
questions and, and these statements.

00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:05.745
And this is kind of the statement
that kept sticking out to me as I

00:11:05.745 --> 00:11:09.045
begin to read this, and I'm gonna
say this at the end of every, every

00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:10.605
section is, don't be this guy.

00:11:10.665 --> 00:11:12.375
So if you want to hear
me say, don't be this.

00:11:13.074 --> 00:11:15.295
I'm also speaking to you, ladies,
don't be this lady, don't be

00:11:15.295 --> 00:11:16.405
this gal, whatever you wanna do.

00:11:16.405 --> 00:11:16.704
Okay.

00:11:16.824 --> 00:11:19.855
And what ends up happening is just
like I did, when I stopped there and

00:11:19.855 --> 00:11:20.736
said, man, he got what he deserved.

00:11:22.064 --> 00:11:23.084
what I'm saying to myself.

00:11:23.084 --> 00:11:23.895
Don't be that guy.

00:11:24.255 --> 00:11:26.084
And there's gonna be a lot of
these statements today that I

00:11:26.084 --> 00:11:29.204
hope will ring true in our lives,
where we can say, you know what?

00:11:29.209 --> 00:11:31.125
I don't need to be that guy or that girl.

00:11:31.605 --> 00:11:33.045
That's not who God made me.

00:11:33.464 --> 00:11:36.555
And we're gonna learn what we need
to be, what guy or girl we need to be

00:11:36.675 --> 00:11:38.084
because of what God has done for us.

00:11:38.115 --> 00:11:40.245
So let's jump in with the younger son.

00:11:40.245 --> 00:11:44.775
First we see here in verses 11 through
16, about his rebellion, right?

00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:48.885
So the younger son gets tired of his
father gets tired of listening to him.

00:11:48.885 --> 00:11:49.245
Right.

00:11:49.454 --> 00:11:50.555
He knows better.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.540
And so here's the interesting part
in that day, the son had every

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.780
right to go and ask for his estate
in advance before his father dies.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:03.160
Typically a father dies, then his estate
is distributed, but at that point it

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.070
was okay to go and ask for his share.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.180
And he did, it was not very
nice that he did, but he could.

00:12:09.845 --> 00:12:11.225
And here's the interesting part.

00:12:11.285 --> 00:12:12.245
I want you to not miss this.

00:12:12.245 --> 00:12:15.755
We're gonna come back and address it
later, but it says that the father went

00:12:15.755 --> 00:12:20.405
ahead and gave it to him and it says,
so he distributed the assets to them.

00:12:20.465 --> 00:12:22.444
What does them mean in this instance?

00:12:23.495 --> 00:12:26.585
Both of the brothers got their
inheritance at that moment.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.360
We're gonna see this later, why this is
important that we don't miss this later.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.490
So he distributed the assets to them.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.090
Right?

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.710
We've all been there though.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.110
When we look at this younger,
younger brother that we think

00:12:37.115 --> 00:12:38.819
we're right, we think we're right.

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:40.319
We think we can do something better.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.850
We know what to do.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.170
And sometimes for parents, the best thing
is to let their kids go ahead and do it.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:47.189
Right.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.939
I've heard my kids say, you know,
but I like jumping on my bed.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.319
Don't do it.

00:12:52.785 --> 00:12:54.015
I like jumping on my bed though.

00:12:54.375 --> 00:12:57.645
And so they do it and they hit their heads
and fall off and wait, that's a song.

00:12:57.915 --> 00:13:02.025
Um, but you guys know this, that
sometimes the best way to teach your

00:13:02.025 --> 00:13:07.665
kids is to let them fail and not, you're
not enjoying it as a parent, but what

00:13:07.665 --> 00:13:11.955
you're realizing that in their failure,
they're gonna realize how wise you are

00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:16.215
or how wise God is in this instance or
how wise this father is in this instance.

00:13:16.215 --> 00:13:17.865
And so what does the father do?

00:13:17.865 --> 00:13:21.480
He gives him him his estate and
he says, you know, You go see

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.650
what you can do with your estate.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.540
See if you know, what's better.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.920
And so we see again, versus 13 and 14,
he decides to gather up all he has.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.550
And he travels to a distance country
where he squandered his old estate.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:37.260
And after he spent everything, there
was a very, uh, hard famine that

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.090
shrunk and he had nothing, right?

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.360
So it didn't take long for
the son to spend his estate.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.120
And when we think about this estate,
this estate had to be pretty.

00:13:46.245 --> 00:13:47.505
and it didn't take long
for him to spend it.

00:13:47.505 --> 00:13:49.875
And the only thing I can attribute
this to, uh, you've probably

00:13:49.875 --> 00:13:52.455
heard the stories about people
that have won the lottery, right?

00:13:52.905 --> 00:13:54.885
Most people that won the lottery
and had to look at the statistic

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.295
because sometimes we just exaggerated.

00:13:56.295 --> 00:14:00.525
But the statistic that I found is that
70% of people that have won at least

00:14:00.525 --> 00:14:02.325
a million dollars are more in lottery.

00:14:02.415 --> 00:14:04.305
After five years are bankrupt.

00:14:04.785 --> 00:14:05.685
After five years.

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:11.145
And so what we realized with this son is,
is he's very similar to the world, right?

00:14:11.145 --> 00:14:14.055
Is they get this big chunk of money
and then they go and they waste it

00:14:14.055 --> 00:14:16.815
thinking, Hey, I've got plenty of
money and all of a sudden it's gone.

00:14:16.935 --> 00:14:20.805
And so, um, we see that he
made the wrong choice, right?

00:14:20.805 --> 00:14:22.005
He did not value money.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:23.325
And I think about that with my kids.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.005
My kids always ask this question.

00:14:25.469 --> 00:14:28.140
This is why it's important as parents
that we don't just give them free reign

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.040
on what we buy is they don't understand
the concept of money typically, right?

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.030
So why can't we do this?

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.140
Why can't we buy this?

00:14:34.469 --> 00:14:35.910
And it's because money
doesn't grow on trees.

00:14:35.915 --> 00:14:37.740
Anybody ever made that statement
money doesn't grow on trees.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.949
Your parents probably told you that
money doesn't grow on trees, but that

00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:44.610
concept doesn't make sense to them because
they're just kids think about this son.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:45.660
That concept didn't make sense to.

00:14:46.395 --> 00:14:48.165
But his father went ahead
and let him figure it out.

00:14:48.225 --> 00:14:51.255
And it obviously came back,
uh, and it didn't even take

00:14:51.255 --> 00:14:52.515
him five years to learn this.

00:14:52.515 --> 00:14:52.845
Right.

00:14:53.205 --> 00:14:56.775
Uh, so he was no wiser than his father
when it came to figuring this out.

00:14:57.225 --> 00:15:01.335
Um, and so when we look at this, just
like the statement I made, we would look

00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:02.865
at this younger son is stupid, right?

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.545
Like I I'm, I'm wiser.

00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:07.935
I mean, how stupid is he to
take his father's investment

00:15:08.355 --> 00:15:09.735
and then go waste it away?

00:15:10.155 --> 00:15:11.775
You know, this is just crazy.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.800
But guys, I wanna, I
wanna stop just a second.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.290
I wanna look at this story from the
context, from a spiritual standpoint,

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.410
in this story, the father is God.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.920
And in this story, the younger
son can be us at times.

00:15:23.565 --> 00:15:28.485
And we've been given an inheritance
through salvation, right?

00:15:28.575 --> 00:15:32.955
Salvation is being forgiven of our
sins, being given a new life, to

00:15:32.955 --> 00:15:36.825
live for Jesus, to experience his
hope now, and his hope and eternity.

00:15:37.365 --> 00:15:41.055
At times, though, what we do is
we take this inheritance and we

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.715
say, you know what, God, I know
what to do with this inheritance.

00:15:44.715 --> 00:15:45.885
And you know what the inheritance is.

00:15:46.035 --> 00:15:47.565
It's a new life.

00:15:48.285 --> 00:15:50.445
God, I know what to do with
this new life more than you do.

00:15:51.105 --> 00:15:52.875
I don't need you anymore, father.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.099
I'm gonna go figure it out on
my own and go do what I want.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.969
And what does that lead to
destruction destruction.

00:15:59.969 --> 00:16:02.430
It, it leads to things that
are not valuable for us.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.120
And so we, we continue on in this story
and this is the interesting part, right?

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.000
So he hits rock bottom.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.719
And where would he, where should
he return back to his father?

00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:15.930
Right back to the one who
said, maybe that's not right,

00:16:15.935 --> 00:16:17.339
but he didn't go back to SAR.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.150
What did he try to do?

00:16:18.209 --> 00:16:21.900
He tried to solve his own problems
rather than emitting this mistake.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.459
Step one.

00:16:23.459 --> 00:16:26.069
I want you to think about this guys,
when you hit rock bottom, whenever

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:32.069
you make decisions that aren't wise
and you know, you know, maybe God is

00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:37.260
right or maybe my father is right,
or whatever it is quickly go back.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.990
Don't try to figure it out on your own
because this is what's gonna happen.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:41.610
He tries to figure it out on his own.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.390
And it says this, that he went to work
for one of the citizens of the country

00:16:45.569 --> 00:16:47.490
who sent him into the fields to feed pigs.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.230
The younger son.

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:54.135
Is now going to do what he didn't
wanna do for his father work.

00:16:54.675 --> 00:16:58.065
He didn't wanna work for his father
anymore, and now he's gonna go work,

00:16:58.395 --> 00:17:01.695
but he's gonna work for someone who he
doesn't even know and come to figure

00:17:01.695 --> 00:17:03.345
out that's not even really feeding him.

00:17:03.945 --> 00:17:08.055
And so he begins to just work and work
and work and it's not fulfilling him.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.350
It's not fulfilling him at all.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.940
And so taking part of the estate and
living it up seemed to be right for

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.740
him, but it really ended up wrong.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.000
It seemed like it would become successful,
but int ultimately it ended up failing.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:26.370
So this is where we see in verse 17
through 19, the younger sons repentance.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.020
This is the part where finally gets in.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:33.060
I love this statement where he says,
when he came to his sense, you ever,

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:36.600
you ever do that sometimes you're in the
middle of doing something and you go.

00:17:36.975 --> 00:17:38.235
What the heck am I doing?

00:17:38.715 --> 00:17:39.615
This is stupid.

00:17:40.695 --> 00:17:40.935
All right.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:43.695
I'm, I'm gonna stop doing this, or I'm
gonna start doing this, whatever it is.

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:44.715
You just come to your senses.

00:17:44.895 --> 00:17:48.465
Well, it finally, he comes to his
senses at rock bottom, after he tried

00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:50.145
to figure it on his own and he repented.

00:17:50.145 --> 00:17:51.615
And this is what the word repent means.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.585
Repent means to change one's mind.

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:58.605
See, I think sometimes when we think of
repentance, we're very, very prideful

00:17:58.605 --> 00:18:00.915
because we have to admit that we failed.

00:18:02.055 --> 00:18:05.145
And I have a pride issue, just, I don't
know about you, but I have a pride issue.

00:18:05.415 --> 00:18:06.795
I don't like being wrong.

00:18:07.935 --> 00:18:09.375
I, I do not like being wrong.

00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:10.005
Ask my wife.

00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:10.755
She's not even in here.

00:18:10.995 --> 00:18:11.805
She knows it.

00:18:12.105 --> 00:18:14.355
We have these battles
because I'm always right.

00:18:14.655 --> 00:18:15.045
Right.

00:18:15.075 --> 00:18:17.115
I mean, anybody like
me, we're always right.

00:18:17.715 --> 00:18:20.535
And when we're not, we wanna
make sure, you know, we're still

00:18:20.535 --> 00:18:21.855
right, because we don't like it.

00:18:21.855 --> 00:18:22.755
Admit we're wrong.

00:18:24.825 --> 00:18:26.415
I point this out to say this guys.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.370
Repentance is so important in our lives.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.970
Most people hear the word repentance
at the moment of salvation.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.170
We need repent of our sins and trust
in the Lord, but we forget that

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.440
repentance is a daily activity.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.130
Why is it daily?

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.540
Because my pride.

00:18:43.575 --> 00:18:48.825
Comes up daily because I am a simple
person, separated from an eternal glory

00:18:48.825 --> 00:18:52.485
where I won't send one day and I'm in the
flesh, which means consistently I'm gonna

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.525
have things where I, I make mistakes.

00:18:54.855 --> 00:18:59.235
I think saying things, I say things
or I do things that do not honor God.

00:18:59.535 --> 00:19:01.365
And most of the time it
doesn't honor those around me.

00:19:01.365 --> 00:19:03.435
And so I need to look inward and repent.

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:06.825
And so we look at this, he decides to
repent because he comes to his sense.

00:19:07.275 --> 00:19:09.675
He realizes what he's doing is crazy.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.820
so what happened?

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.210
Right?

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:18.090
He changed his mind about his situation
about himself, and he admitted his need.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:23.010
I I've challenged many people
before with this statement.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.620
Like our lives are heading in the
direction of our strongest thoughts.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:31.500
Do you know that the, the battles that
I face every day are one in the mind?

00:19:32.655 --> 00:19:36.495
I'm just telling you because the
mind is consistently deceiving me.

00:19:36.495 --> 00:19:39.915
The enemy, we all have an enemy
that is consistently trying

00:19:39.915 --> 00:19:41.355
to distract us consistently.

00:19:41.355 --> 00:19:46.905
Try to make us think that money or
relationships or position in our job or

00:19:46.905 --> 00:19:51.775
social media or friends you fill in the
blank is what is going to fulfill you.

00:19:53.564 --> 00:19:55.125
But we need to come to
the same conclusion.

00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:58.155
We need to come to our senses,
just like the younger son did.

00:19:58.485 --> 00:20:02.564
And we need to admit that we have
failed, that we are seeking the

00:20:02.564 --> 00:20:04.965
things that are not beneficial for us.

00:20:05.294 --> 00:20:07.034
And so here's one of the
things I think so cool.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.895
So it goes on here and it says
when he came to his census, he

00:20:08.895 --> 00:20:13.334
said, how many of my fathers hired
workers have more than enough food?

00:20:13.425 --> 00:20:14.834
And I'm here dying of hunger.

00:20:15.344 --> 00:20:20.594
At this point, the younger son realized
that his father was a generous.

00:20:21.615 --> 00:20:27.645
Because his hired workers would be the
lowest of low on, on, on, basically if you

00:20:27.645 --> 00:20:31.095
look at his whole estate that he owned,
those would probably be the low people.

00:20:31.095 --> 00:20:34.485
The people that are just the common
workers and even those people, his

00:20:34.485 --> 00:20:36.195
father take takes care of well.

00:20:36.405 --> 00:20:40.125
And he's like, you know, even if I was one
of them, I would be well taken care of.

00:20:40.275 --> 00:20:43.275
So he begins to realize that his
father is generous as he's coming

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:45.795
to his sense, as he realizes that
his father takes care of them.

00:20:45.945 --> 00:20:48.525
And I love this statement cuz
it really challenges us when we

00:20:48.525 --> 00:20:49.875
think of this picture of God.

00:20:51.075 --> 00:20:55.935
And God loving, even the least of
those, this is what's so important.

00:20:56.205 --> 00:21:01.155
It is God's goodness,
not just man's badness.

00:21:01.335 --> 00:21:02.475
That leads us to repentance.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.105
I'm gonna say this again.

00:21:03.105 --> 00:21:06.225
It's God's goodness,
not just man's badness.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:07.245
That leads us to repentance.

00:21:07.425 --> 00:21:08.895
Most people think about this.

00:21:08.925 --> 00:21:10.365
Most of us think this way.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.000
I feel bad for my sin because I've
fallen short of whatever God's called

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.350
me to, or I have conviction in my life.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.730
I'm such a horrible person.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.910
I need to repent, but we don't
realize that a loving father

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:24.150
sitting on the other side of that
repentance saying, I love you.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.730
Even in the middle of your
sin, he's saying, I love you.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.090
I'm a good father who takes
care of the least of these.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.970
If you feel like the
least of ease, I love you.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:38.490
See, I need to see that more times
than not because all soak all soak.

00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:39.419
I'll say that right.

00:21:39.419 --> 00:21:40.169
Better all.

00:21:40.169 --> 00:21:45.600
So in my badness, I'll look in
the mirror and I'll hate myself.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.470
I'll think of the things I think of
or the things that I do or I don't do.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:56.460
And I will destroy myself and I'll forget
that the father's love is greater because

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.320
he even takes care of the least of these.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.330
And in that moment, I am the least of.

00:22:01.425 --> 00:22:04.755
See, I think it's so important that
we put those two together and this

00:22:04.755 --> 00:22:08.805
son came to his senses not to see his
badness because he had, I mean, I'm,

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.205
I'm guessing the reason why he didn't
go back to his father initially.

00:22:11.835 --> 00:22:14.175
How can I come back to my father
empty handed with nothing?

00:22:14.925 --> 00:22:18.105
I'm gonna go work and maybe I can
come back later with something guys.

00:22:18.105 --> 00:22:18.645
I'll tell you.

00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:20.615
We try to clean ourselves
up before we come to God.

00:22:21.375 --> 00:22:24.555
Even, even if you've come to faith
in Christ, we still do that today.

00:22:24.765 --> 00:22:27.435
We try to come to the Lord and say,
well, I've reconciled with myself and

00:22:27.435 --> 00:22:29.145
other people now, will you forgive me?

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:32.055
And the father's sitting there the whole
time saying I would've forgiven you at

00:22:32.055 --> 00:22:33.825
the moment that you recognized your fault.

00:22:34.455 --> 00:22:37.245
You could have came a lot earlier,
but I, I even go back to before

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:41.835
salvation, if you've not given your
life to Christ, I sat a year in the

00:22:41.835 --> 00:22:45.645
church listening to gospel message
after gospel message, trying to

00:22:45.645 --> 00:22:47.625
make myself right before I came to.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.960
I spent a year trying to be a
better person before I could

00:22:51.965 --> 00:22:53.250
admit to God that I needed him.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.220
And you know what I realized after a
year I was never gonna be good enough.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.900
I was never gonna be good enough.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:03.000
And then I realized this God never
asked me to be because he is.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.350
So there came a moment on a Sunday
night that I said, I can't do it.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:09.210
And the Lord said, you don't have to.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.080
I already did.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.660
And that's what changed my life.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:17.040
But even as a believer, We need to
be reminded that we don't need to

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.419
get it right before we come to God.

00:23:18.419 --> 00:23:19.949
We need to come to God to get it right.

00:23:20.129 --> 00:23:20.790
I'll say that again.

00:23:20.939 --> 00:23:22.889
We don't need to get it
right before we come to God.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.540
We need to come to God to get it right.

00:23:25.229 --> 00:23:26.159
That approach.

00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:27.840
That's good.

00:23:29.219 --> 00:23:30.419
I ain't have that in my notes.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.879
somebody hashtag that for me.

00:23:32.879 --> 00:23:33.719
I'll remember it later.

00:23:35.189 --> 00:23:36.389
So he humbled himself, right?

00:23:36.389 --> 00:23:37.320
That's hard to do.

00:23:37.889 --> 00:23:40.530
I think that's the most difficult
thing to do in my life is to

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.969
humble myself and admit I'm.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:48.120
But we just need to recognize our
sin and our need is not enough.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:48.840
This is so important.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.649
We can't just recognize
our sin and our need.

00:23:52.949 --> 00:23:54.810
We need to respond by
getting up and going.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.879
This is where I love versus 20 and 21.

00:23:56.879 --> 00:23:59.159
We're gonna lead the read the
first part of 20, and we're gonna

00:23:59.165 --> 00:24:01.919
lead all of 21 because the second
part of 20 talks about the father.

00:24:01.925 --> 00:24:03.030
And we're gonna get into
that in just a minute.

00:24:04.305 --> 00:24:08.655
but the first part of, so I didn't even
read these, but verse 18 and 19, really

00:24:08.655 --> 00:24:10.275
talk about him reciting to himself.

00:24:10.275 --> 00:24:12.225
What he's gonna tell his
father when he gets there.

00:24:12.705 --> 00:24:14.265
But then verse 20 says this.

00:24:14.504 --> 00:24:19.545
So he got up and he went to
his father, do not miss this.

00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:22.845
Sometimes we see ourselves and our sin.

00:24:24.135 --> 00:24:29.655
Sometimes we repeat in our heads what we
need to do, but then we never act on him.

00:24:30.795 --> 00:24:35.145
Let me give you a great example again,
we're we have a mission team here

00:24:35.145 --> 00:24:36.495
from Oklahoma, if you don't know that.

00:24:36.495 --> 00:24:40.275
So this is the mission team from Oklahoma,
but you guys have sat in church services.

00:24:40.395 --> 00:24:42.825
Most of y'all at some point in the
last couple years, if you haven't

00:24:42.825 --> 00:24:46.425
been in one and you've listened to
a message where, you know, you've

00:24:46.425 --> 00:24:49.095
heard the truth, maybe it's the
truth to give your life to Christ.

00:24:49.245 --> 00:24:52.545
You know what to do to give your life
to Christ or to repent of your sins.

00:24:53.235 --> 00:24:54.705
And you are like, I know what to do.

00:24:54.795 --> 00:24:56.745
And you know, you've left outta
that service and not done it.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.360
I mean, I've done that and I've been
preaching the messages and there's

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.500
times I've left out and not done it.

00:25:01.889 --> 00:25:03.240
So you probably relate a lot with me.

00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:07.830
We know what to do this, this
younger brother, the younger son

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.590
knew what to do, but he acted on it.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:14.700
I love that in verse 20 that he
got up and he went to his father.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.570
And again, I'm gonna talk about that
less part of, uh, 20 in just a minute.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:19.679
So let's jump down to 21.

00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:22.440
It says the son says to the father,
after the father comes to him, I have

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.000
sinned against heaven in inner sight.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.889
And I am no longer
worthy to be called your.

00:25:27.105 --> 00:25:30.915
So he admitted his sin and
asked for forgiveness after his

00:25:30.915 --> 00:25:32.805
father came and, and hugged him.

00:25:33.675 --> 00:25:36.285
So here's the statements I wanted to
leave you with just with the younger son.

00:25:36.495 --> 00:25:37.935
What we can learn from the younger son.

00:25:38.085 --> 00:25:42.705
Number one, don't be the guy or gal
who thinks he or she doesn't need

00:25:42.705 --> 00:25:44.235
God to guide or direct their lives.

00:25:44.535 --> 00:25:47.985
Don't be that person that
says, God, I got this.

00:25:49.455 --> 00:25:54.375
Or if you've given your life to Christ
and you're saying, Hey, I'm saved.

00:25:54.555 --> 00:25:56.925
Don't just say, Hey, I've given
my life to Christ and I've got,

00:25:56.925 --> 00:25:58.095
I've got the rest of my life.

00:25:58.635 --> 00:26:00.014
I'll come back to you when I need you.

00:26:00.345 --> 00:26:03.284
Because if not, if that's
what we choose to do, we'll

00:26:03.284 --> 00:26:04.365
be just like the prodigal son.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.014
We'll catch ourselves
running back to the father.

00:26:06.555 --> 00:26:09.795
Number two, don't be that guy who is
too prideful to admit he was wrong,

00:26:10.245 --> 00:26:11.565
which will lead to destruction.

00:26:11.895 --> 00:26:12.885
Humble yourselves.

00:26:13.575 --> 00:26:14.175
Last one.

00:26:14.175 --> 00:26:17.705
Don't be that guy who thinks he cannot
be forgiven for what he has done.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.820
I, I want you to not miss that statement.

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:26.070
There are times guys where you will
have moments in your life where you

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:30.840
will think that you've gone too far and
you, the Lord's gonna say not in, not

00:26:30.845 --> 00:26:33.659
in my book, you can still come back.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.879
So those are some statements I
want you to cling to from the

00:26:35.879 --> 00:26:37.800
younger brother will re reflect on
those at the end of the message.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.080
We're gonna jump on now to the father.

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:41.985
And this is a great picture.

00:26:41.985 --> 00:26:44.445
Again, this father in this
picture is the father.

00:26:44.445 --> 00:26:44.895
God.

00:26:45.254 --> 00:26:48.195
So let's read verse 20 when I'm
gonna read all of 20 together,

00:26:48.195 --> 00:26:51.705
it says, so he got up speaking of
the son and he went to his father.

00:26:52.155 --> 00:26:56.534
But while the son was still a
long way off, his father saw him

00:26:56.865 --> 00:26:58.754
and was filled with compassion.

00:26:59.264 --> 00:27:00.554
Let's set this up.

00:27:01.575 --> 00:27:05.925
Number one, the father is
looking for his son to come back.

00:27:07.665 --> 00:27:10.304
If he wasn't, he wouldn't
have saw him far off.

00:27:10.544 --> 00:27:13.935
He would've been busy working,
going on about his life and his son

00:27:13.935 --> 00:27:16.245
would've showed up and he would've
been like, oh, son you're back.

00:27:16.604 --> 00:27:18.824
But he was looking for his son.

00:27:18.824 --> 00:27:19.695
Number two.

00:27:20.804 --> 00:27:25.995
He was already ready to forgive him
before he knew if he was gonna ask

00:27:25.995 --> 00:27:29.925
for forgiveness, because he asked
for forgiveness after the father

00:27:30.075 --> 00:27:32.475
hugged him, let's read that right.

00:27:32.895 --> 00:27:36.135
And said, so we got up and went to his
father, but when the son was still far

00:27:36.135 --> 00:27:39.885
off, he saw him and was filled with
compassion and he ran and threw his

00:27:39.885 --> 00:27:42.375
arms around his neck and he kissed him.

00:27:43.335 --> 00:27:46.245
The father came to him.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:50.940
Before he knew now again, maybe him
walking back, he had a sense, he's

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.670
probably coming back asking for
forgiveness, but he had no clue.

00:27:54.449 --> 00:27:56.070
I think that's such a huge picture.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.699
When we look at this, we have to take the
first step, which is what the son did.

00:27:59.879 --> 00:28:01.379
It says he got up and went.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:06.480
We have to get up and recognize our
need for God, but God will do the rest.

00:28:06.719 --> 00:28:08.610
He will run after you.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:09.870
He will put his arms around you.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.389
And I know you may not like
this, but God will kiss you now.

00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:14.639
That's just not literal,
but you know what I mean?

00:28:14.639 --> 00:28:16.469
He won't withhold anything from.

00:28:17.024 --> 00:28:18.705
It's basically what
this thought is, right?

00:28:19.004 --> 00:28:21.435
He gets up from his throne
and he walks towards you.

00:28:21.554 --> 00:28:22.695
He runs towards you.

00:28:22.965 --> 00:28:26.475
And I love this father or this
thought that this father is exactly

00:28:26.475 --> 00:28:28.215
like God that he runs to us.

00:28:28.215 --> 00:28:28.605
Right.

00:28:30.165 --> 00:28:30.554
We don't.

00:28:31.004 --> 00:28:32.355
And here's another
picture I want you to see.

00:28:32.564 --> 00:28:35.475
We don't have to come all cleaned
up before God welcomes us home.

00:28:35.475 --> 00:28:36.314
Think about this guy.

00:28:36.375 --> 00:28:40.935
He literally came from the
pig pins to go see his father.

00:28:41.895 --> 00:28:44.294
And imagine his father, I'm just
telling you I'd be this father.

00:28:44.355 --> 00:28:47.715
I love my kids, but if they're in the
pick pen and they start coming back,

00:28:47.715 --> 00:28:49.125
I'm gonna be like, go get cleaned up.

00:28:49.335 --> 00:28:51.524
And when you're done getting
cleaned up, I'll give you a hug,

00:28:52.395 --> 00:28:55.455
but this father did not do that.

00:28:55.514 --> 00:28:58.335
He ran to his son who would
be dirty and disgusting.

00:28:59.085 --> 00:29:00.255
And he began to hug him.

00:29:00.615 --> 00:29:04.215
And that may not be a good scene
in your mind, but to me, that is

00:29:04.215 --> 00:29:06.035
a father that will go wherever.

00:29:06.135 --> 00:29:11.655
And whenever, however, to meet his son
and his children, wherever they're at,

00:29:12.015 --> 00:29:18.465
if this is a picture of God, there is
nothing that God sees your life, that he's

00:29:18.465 --> 00:29:20.805
like you're too disgusting to be around.

00:29:22.395 --> 00:29:23.175
There's nothing.

00:29:23.775 --> 00:29:27.135
And see, that's the God that I
continually want to preach about.

00:29:27.315 --> 00:29:28.215
I wanna preach about a God.

00:29:28.215 --> 00:29:29.295
That is not the God.

00:29:29.565 --> 00:29:30.585
That is all this mean.

00:29:30.585 --> 00:29:33.345
God, that just wants to judge
everybody and see everybody go to hell.

00:29:33.405 --> 00:29:34.335
That's not God.

00:29:34.995 --> 00:29:39.045
God's a compassionate God that loves
everyone and desires everyone to come

00:29:39.045 --> 00:29:41.985
to know him and experience the hope
and the peace and the joy and the

00:29:41.985 --> 00:29:44.595
love of a hug and a loving father.

00:29:45.735 --> 00:29:49.995
This picture is so huge to see
for us because sometimes we think

00:29:49.995 --> 00:29:52.035
we need to clean ourselves up
before we come to the father.

00:29:52.935 --> 00:29:57.375
So in verse 22, it goes on, it says, but
the father told us servants, and this

00:29:57.375 --> 00:30:02.205
is right after he in verse 21, the son,
again, now he shows any repents, right?

00:30:02.415 --> 00:30:06.014
I've said in your sight, I'm no
longer to be worthy to call your son.

00:30:06.135 --> 00:30:10.995
And it's almost like the father ignored
anything he said, and he said, servants.

00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:15.840
You go get the best robe and you put it
on him and you put the ring on him and the

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.340
finger on his sandals and on his feet and
bring out the phatic, Cal and slaughter

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.470
it, and let's celebrate with the feast.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.080
So all the younger son wanted to do.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.610
If you remember, he just
wanted to be the least of the

00:30:26.615 --> 00:30:28.830
least in his father's kingdom.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:29.940
That's it.

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:31.950
See, here's the cool part.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.649
When we come to Jesus, even after
we've given our lives to Christ and

00:30:34.649 --> 00:30:38.700
we repent when we come to Jesus, we
are restored back to our original.

00:30:39.449 --> 00:30:43.949
I believe before the son left, he
had a coat, nice coat, and he had a

00:30:43.949 --> 00:30:45.330
ring and he had signals on his feet.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:48.149
The father just restored
him back to his position.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.310
He didn't say this,
this is another picture.

00:30:50.314 --> 00:30:54.179
I want you to see guys, the father, didn't
say, Hey, there's gonna be a trial period.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.560
And we're gonna see, you know, in three
to six weeks, if you do good enough.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:03.179
And if you do, I might move you up a rung
and we're gonna wait a little longer.

00:31:03.179 --> 00:31:07.139
No, he restored him back to this level.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.600
This is a challenge for me guys.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.379
I am, I'm kind of that person, when
somebody hurts me, I kind of wanna

00:31:13.379 --> 00:31:15.420
let them back into my life slowly.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:19.320
And, and so, you know, this isn't like
condoning, like somebody who is abusive

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.530
or whatever to, to like let them back
into your life fully to do that again.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.160
But I would even say a lot of times, it's,
it's, it's understanding in relationships

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:31.800
that we cannot hold a grudge over
someone and hold a standard that they

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.450
have to meet before forgiveness comes.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.340
You wanna know why we forgive people?

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.480
Not because they're forgivable, meaning
like they've done something to be

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.310
forgiven, but because God has forgiven us.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:45.540
If, if that's the God that runs
after me and hugs me just so you

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.390
know, the person that you're not
forgiving, God's hugging them too.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.310
He's running after them too.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.760
And as much as you don't like it and wait,
we're starting to really hit the button.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.120
Right.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:58.770
These Pharisees didn't like it
as much as we don't like it.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.780
That's who God is.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.130
That's why God sent Jesus.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:06.240
He sent Jesus here to be with
the sinners and tax collectors,

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.230
the worst of the worst.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.070
And when we start thinking that we are
not the worst of the worst, we have

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.820
become the worst of the worst because
we have become prideful and realizing

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.690
that we are all broken and in need
of Jesus and in need of God's love.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.080
So he puts the best clothes and the
best shoes and the best ring on him.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:22.410
Right?

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:27.420
And this is this picture that this
son is no longer a slave to sin.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.720
That is beautiful, that he is now.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.270
A son and a child of God.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:39.150
So he celebrates his son repentance by
throwing a party who doesn't like parties.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:39.810
I love parties.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.010
We should throw more parties.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:41.730
I realize this.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:44.400
When people get their lives to
Christ here, we should literally

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.830
just stop everything, ordering
pizza and just hang out.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.940
I mean, being honest and, and you
wanna know why let's go back to,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.590
to chapters to get chapter 15.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:54.870
Let's look at verse, um, 10 here.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:57.390
Let's just read the whole parable.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:58.110
So it makes sense.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.950
This is the lost coin.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:03.660
So verse eight through 10, it says,
or what woman who is 10 coins.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:08.040
If she loses one coin, does, does
not lie to lamp, sweep the house and

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.600
search carefully until she finds it.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.720
And when she finds it, she calls her
friends and neighbors together and

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.890
rejoices to rejoice with me because I
have found the silver coin that I've lost.

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.450
And this is Jesus saying this.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:22.260
He says, I tell you in the same
way, there is joy in the presence of

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.940
angels over one sinner who are pin.

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:27.420
Do you know, that verse was repeated
to me the day I gave my life to Christ

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.970
and I walked down to my pastor and I
said, Hey, I gave my life to Christ

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:30.930
and he repeated that verse to me.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:31.890
And here's what he said.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.430
Do you know the, there is a
party going on in heaven for you?

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:37.410
And I went, what?

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:38.910
Yeah.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.650
So this is what I love about the father.

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:42.600
He took a literal, Hey, if there's
a party going on in heaven, why

00:33:42.605 --> 00:33:43.920
don't we just duplicate it here?

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.420
Let's kill the fat and calf.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.100
Let let's party.

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:47.880
Why?

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.370
Because he says my son was dead.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.610
My son was lost and he is now alive.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:59.460
If you've given your life to Christ, that
is you every day, cuz every day that you

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:04.680
wake up and you realize that you are a
child of God celebrate, you are not dead.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:08.370
You are alive, you are receiving
hope and forgiveness of your sin.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.690
Like that is a beautiful picture
of, of this celebration, right?

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.240
So what can we learn from the father?

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:17.130
This is great.

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:21.210
Don't be the guy who thinks again that
God is an angry God that will just,

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:22.770
just wants to destroy us and punish us.

00:34:23.864 --> 00:34:28.784
He is a guy that loves us and pursues
us and will meet us where we are at.

00:34:29.294 --> 00:34:30.705
Don't be that guy or girl.

00:34:30.705 --> 00:34:36.315
I wanna continue to say that who
thinks God forgives you, but he'll

00:34:36.319 --> 00:34:37.904
never use you the way he did before.

00:34:38.495 --> 00:34:42.524
I, I, I want to be as clear as
possible as your pastor today of the

00:34:42.524 --> 00:34:44.264
things that God has forgiven me for.

00:34:44.594 --> 00:34:46.574
I have many times thought,
should I even be a pastor?

00:34:46.574 --> 00:34:48.375
And so, you know, it's not like
I'm talking about like, major, but

00:34:48.375 --> 00:34:49.514
like, should I even be a pastor?

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:51.779
Like sometimes I just
struggle with laziness.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.210
Sometimes I just struggle
with self-confidence.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:55.799
Should I even be leading this church?

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:57.360
And you know what?

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.770
God reminds me.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:02.880
You're not, I am through you obedience.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.730
And every single time I ask God
to forgive me and I come back

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:06.690
to him and I swear to him here.

00:35:06.695 --> 00:35:09.720
I'm just reminded God uses broken people.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:11.009
Every day.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.820
So don't let God deceive you.

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:19.170
If he forgives you, that he can't
use you in amazing ways like you

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.960
did before, or maybe even the first
time before here's the last one.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:26.100
Don't be that guy who thinks repentance
is a one time thing for salvation.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.100
Remember that repentance
is a daily process.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.250
And as we repent, we are restored
to a new relationship and our

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:33.570
relationship is right with God.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:38.730
And our lives are a lot closer to
God and we are spending less time.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.770
Living in despair.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:42.570
So let's look at the older son.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.910
We're gonna summarize this with
the older son and, and move on.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.890
I know you guys have been
hanging on for this for a while,

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.930
but now the older son, right?

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:52.200
This is the part of the story that Jesus
is addressing the religious leaders

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.980
right about their outward actions
may have been blameless, but their

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.930
inward attitudes may not have been.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.840
So the first part we see here in
the first three verses 25 through

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.440
27 is really just the older brother
being made aware of what happened.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:08.130
So now the older son has
been in the field all day.

00:36:09.029 --> 00:36:11.520
He came near to the house and
he heard dancing to music and he

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.180
summoned one of the servants and
questioned what these things meant.

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:17.190
He said, your brother is here.

00:36:17.669 --> 00:36:20.490
He told him, and your father has
slaughtered the fat and calf because

00:36:20.495 --> 00:36:21.899
he has come back safe and sound.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.330
That should be good news.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.609
I just tell you, I love
my brother and sister.

00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:31.410
If I knew that they had lo left, I
would be super happy if they came back.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.919
But let's, let's not give
this guy much of a hard time.

00:36:34.919 --> 00:36:35.580
Wanna know why.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:40.920
Because the younger son demanded half
of the, the estate and took it with him.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:45.839
He, he basically said when he took that
estate father, this is the younger son

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:49.170
basically saying to the older father,
when he takes this estate, I wish you

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.060
were dead because I want your money now.

00:36:52.049 --> 00:36:54.569
So how his younger brother left was tough.

00:36:54.569 --> 00:36:57.839
So the older brother sitting
here going, what's going on?

00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:59.009
Did I miss something?

00:36:59.009 --> 00:37:01.379
Didn't the younger son,
the younger brother.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.299
Wasn't he a horrible person?

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.270
Why should there be a party?

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.690
Right.

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:11.340
So I think that there's two people
that's and I love this story.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.930
There's two people that would be
frustrated and mad at what's happening.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.220
Number one, it's the brother number two.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.340
It's the calf that fat a calf
had been getting fat for a while.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.540
And now he's dead.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.910
Sorry, horrible joke.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:28.740
But we see that the older
brother was unwilling to forgive.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.440
Let's look at verses
26 and on it says here.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.970
So he summoned one of the, or, sorry.

00:37:33.615 --> 00:37:36.945
Um, yeah, so he summoned one
of the servants and questioned

00:37:36.945 --> 00:37:37.905
what these things meant.

00:37:38.535 --> 00:37:41.535
Um, uh, where am I at here?

00:37:41.535 --> 00:37:42.465
Am I on the right page?

00:37:42.705 --> 00:37:43.575
Yeah, I'm on the right page.

00:37:43.575 --> 00:37:44.055
I'm sorry.

00:37:44.445 --> 00:37:45.405
He says your brother's here.

00:37:45.405 --> 00:37:45.915
I've already read that.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.115
So 28 he says, then he became angry
and didn't want to go into the party.

00:37:50.115 --> 00:37:50.445
Right.

00:37:50.445 --> 00:37:52.545
So his father came out
and pleaded with him.

00:37:52.545 --> 00:37:53.475
Let's stop right there.

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:59.655
The father has now ran
after the younger son.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.550
and met him in his despair.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:07.140
And now the older brother is refusing
to go in and the father doesn't go.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.810
You know, I ran out to the younger
brother because he was coming back,

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.800
but you're refusing to come in.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.490
I'm not coming out.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.390
No, he, he met him where he was at too.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.430
See, that's how good God is.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.160
There's only, there's not like three
places that God's gonna meet you at.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.720
No, he meets you anywhere you were at.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.650
And this is what the father does.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.960
He meets him outside where he is at.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.010
And here's what he says.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:30.359
Um, He says, but he replies to his father.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.540
He says, look, I've been slaving
many years for you and I've

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.370
never disobeyed your orders yet.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:38.399
You gave, never gave me a goat so that
I could celebrate with my friends.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.370
He says, but when the son of
yours, who has, devouted your

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:44.819
assets with prostitutes, you
slaughtered the Fadden calf for him.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:45.960
Right.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:50.160
When we look at the brother's resume,
it would be hard to kind of say,

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.780
man, the father did him wrong, right.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.200
He didn't give him a goat, at least
a goat to party with his friends.

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:58.290
He, he didn't give him things
after all of his hard work.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.740
I'll just anybody ever been judgemental
at your work where you're working

00:39:01.745 --> 00:39:05.460
your tell off and like you're
coworker works half the, and you're

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.680
both getting the same money and
the same raise and the same time.

00:39:08.265 --> 00:39:10.065
You, you all know you've had that.

00:39:10.215 --> 00:39:13.215
And if your kids, you've probably seen
this, you'll see some of the kids in your

00:39:13.215 --> 00:39:16.305
classroom, they're doing half the work,
but somehow the teacher doesn't care and

00:39:16.305 --> 00:39:17.385
they just give 'em the grades they want.

00:39:17.925 --> 00:39:18.885
I mean, it's happened to me.

00:39:19.425 --> 00:39:21.825
Like we've all had those moments
where, where somebody's getting

00:39:21.825 --> 00:39:24.225
something better than us and we
don't get it cuz we've worked hard.

00:39:24.645 --> 00:39:27.315
So the brother seems to again,
have a justified position.

00:39:27.675 --> 00:39:29.835
So we seem to wanna relate with
the older brother a little bit.

00:39:30.135 --> 00:39:33.045
I know I do, but there's a deeper issue.

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:36.629
As we begin to look at this, the
brother's actually pretty self righteous.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.100
I've never done anything wrong.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.839
I've worked hard my whole life for you.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.100
Like that's pretty bold statements to say,
because I know none of us are perfect.

00:39:44.609 --> 00:39:48.120
He's unconcerned for his younger
brother who was lost, who he

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.589
knew had lost all of his money.

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:53.370
He also had a poor attitude towards his
father in the way his father treated him.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.710
So he wasn't respectful
there and he was prideful.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:56.189
Right.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:58.950
And this is just reminds me of this.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:59.730
We can do.

00:40:00.585 --> 00:40:03.945
All these things for the Lord, but
with the wrong heart are nothing,

00:40:05.085 --> 00:40:07.575
you know, it's better to have the
right heart and, and well, you're

00:40:07.575 --> 00:40:08.685
gonna do something the right heart.

00:40:08.685 --> 00:40:11.985
But typically what happens is we try
to justify ourselves by our works.

00:40:12.165 --> 00:40:13.905
And that's what this older
brother was trying to do.

00:40:14.085 --> 00:40:17.535
He didn't wanna share in his
father's own estate with his brother.

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:18.495
Think about it.

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:21.780
The cat that they had
killed was his brothers.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.630
Because at that moment, when they
split the estate, the brother

00:40:24.635 --> 00:40:27.900
owned a portion and now the
younger brother owned a portion.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.930
So everything that they were eating
that day was the older brothers.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:34.920
So now the younger brothers now
taking his estate that seemed

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:35.970
to burn a little bit harder.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:36.330
Right.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.210
But this would stick to the
heart of the religious leaders.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:39.990
This is what we're talking about.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.260
Right?

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:44.250
Why should a center and a thief
get a party thrown for them?

00:40:45.075 --> 00:40:49.365
When the older brother had been OB OBN
and this is the challenge, guys, how

00:40:49.365 --> 00:40:51.825
do we get past this and reconcile this?

00:40:52.005 --> 00:40:52.875
This is the realization.

00:40:52.875 --> 00:40:54.015
This is where the father comes in.

00:40:54.015 --> 00:40:58.545
He says, son speaking to the older
brother, he said to him, you are always

00:40:58.545 --> 00:41:00.945
with me and everything I have is yours.

00:41:01.815 --> 00:41:04.575
I, I want to stop and just
rest in this for a moment.

00:41:05.745 --> 00:41:07.785
Sometimes we get so caught.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:13.350
In doing all the right things
that we forget to celebrate and

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:17.520
enjoy all that we've been given
through an inheritance in Christ.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:21.900
We wanna, we wanna just continue
to work like it's on our own

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:23.880
work, that that gets us to heaven.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.150
But the whole time the older
brother was with the father.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.330
Everything the father had was
his, the, the state was split.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.740
The older son could have
actually went and had the party.

00:41:35.009 --> 00:41:38.250
It was his, and he was
with the father every day.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.910
So whenever his brother, and this is
the next part, whenever his brother

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:46.680
comes and it says, but, um, but we had
to celebrate and rejoice because the

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:51.089
brother of yours was dead and is alive
again, he was lost and is now fine found.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.629
So basically the father tells the brother
we need to celebrate because your brother.

00:41:55.665 --> 00:41:57.315
It's come back to life and is found.

00:41:57.555 --> 00:42:01.215
See, again, we, we wanna be the
people that has all the money and

00:42:01.215 --> 00:42:03.825
all the possessions and anybody
else that's made a mistake.

00:42:03.825 --> 00:42:06.915
We wanna be like hanging in over their
head and being like, you know what?

00:42:06.915 --> 00:42:09.105
You get go back to the,
you got what you deserve.

00:42:09.134 --> 00:42:10.455
The younger brother got what he deserve.

00:42:10.455 --> 00:42:10.815
Right.

00:42:11.384 --> 00:42:15.705
We wanna be that prideful, arrogant,
like it's all ours, but just remember

00:42:15.705 --> 00:42:19.395
the estate that, that older brother
had was his father's that he gave.

00:42:19.725 --> 00:42:24.825
I, I don't know guys, there's, there's
so many things that we can see with this,

00:42:24.825 --> 00:42:26.265
and I wanna wanna kind of end with this.

00:42:26.505 --> 00:42:28.515
What can we learn from the older brother?

00:42:29.174 --> 00:42:32.714
Don't be that guy who thinks someone
should not be forgiven for what

00:42:32.714 --> 00:42:34.605
they have done, because they've
sinned differently than you.

00:42:35.055 --> 00:42:35.924
I'm gonna say this again.

00:42:37.154 --> 00:42:40.665
Don't be that guy or girl who thinks
someone should not be forgiven

00:42:40.935 --> 00:42:43.005
for what they have done because
they've sinned differently than.

00:42:45.075 --> 00:42:48.225
the older brother and the younger
brother, both had sin in the lives.

00:42:48.225 --> 00:42:49.215
One was sin of pride.

00:42:49.215 --> 00:42:50.865
One was sin of rebellion.

00:42:51.585 --> 00:42:52.815
Both of 'em had a sin issue.

00:42:53.385 --> 00:42:58.485
One recognized it, the other didn't
don't be that person that wants to be

00:42:58.485 --> 00:43:02.145
forgiven of your sins, but not of someone
else's if they sin differently, don't

00:43:02.145 --> 00:43:03.975
be that guy who says I'll celebrate.

00:43:04.665 --> 00:43:07.695
When I know someone proves that
they've truly repented again.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:09.690
Time will tell.

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:13.410
I I've said that before somebody, you
know, ask for forgiveness or they give

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:16.290
the life to Christ time will tell,
guess the moment we're doing that

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:20.640
is the moment that we are again, not
trusting in what God ha does for us.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:20.880
Every day.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.400
When we ask God forgiveness,
I wanna be fully restored.

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:26.460
I don't want him to put me on a
six week, you know, testing period.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.830
And that's exactly what
he doesn't do, right?

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:32.069
The father didn't wait for the younger
son to prove that he, what he had learned.

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:36.660
Don't be that guy who thinks he is
better than the world around him.

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:37.050
Guys.

00:43:37.055 --> 00:43:41.130
Don't be that church member that
Christian, that looks down on the world,

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:48.720
you're in the world and you are part of
the brokenness and you are, are blessed

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.250
to have received the inheritance.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.430
And when you have that inheritance,
you are blessed to give that

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:55.110
inheritance to those who don't have it.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:57.600
Last one, don't be that guy.

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.150
Who's too stubborn to
see the log in his own.

00:44:02.715 --> 00:44:04.695
And not be willing to
repent the older brother.

00:44:05.025 --> 00:44:08.085
We don't see how the story ends,
but most likely, if you kinda

00:44:08.085 --> 00:44:11.055
look at this, the older brother
didn't care, he just didn't care.

00:44:11.055 --> 00:44:15.195
He could not see past his pride
and sinfulness that his brother

00:44:15.345 --> 00:44:17.985
was back home, safe and alive.

00:44:19.425 --> 00:44:21.615
This story brings up a
lot to be thought about.

00:44:21.615 --> 00:44:23.445
There's a lot in this story, right?

00:44:23.445 --> 00:44:26.595
I've shared multiple things
about what not to be right.

00:44:26.595 --> 00:44:27.345
Fill in the blank.

00:44:28.155 --> 00:44:31.035
And as we go into a time of invitation,
I'm just gonna repeat some of these

00:44:31.035 --> 00:44:33.315
things for you guys to think through that.

00:44:33.315 --> 00:44:37.635
You can ask the Lord this
question in this story, who am I?

00:44:39.345 --> 00:44:40.305
Am I the older brother?

00:44:41.279 --> 00:44:44.310
Because that's exactly who the, the Jesus
was speaking to, was those religious

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:48.569
leaders, religious leaders who did all
the good things, the right things on the

00:44:48.575 --> 00:44:51.149
outside, but their heart was not right.

00:44:51.509 --> 00:44:52.950
Are you the younger brother?

00:44:53.730 --> 00:45:00.720
And you have ran from the Lord, you have
wasted some of the, the precious life

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.950
that God has given you after salvation
to not live a life for the glory of God.

00:45:05.189 --> 00:45:09.270
And for the benefit of others, maybe
you need to repent and turn from God.

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:11.580
Or turn to God from your sins.

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:17.490
And, uh, maybe that's something you
need to ask the Lord about today.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:19.350
So I'm gonna read through these.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:23.100
So you guys can just think through
these to be able to think maybe

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.240
what God would be speaking to you.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:29.880
So again, don't be the guy who
thinks that he or she knows, right.

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:31.530
Or girl, he, she knows.

00:45:32.175 --> 00:45:34.635
They don't need to be
guided or directed by God.

00:45:34.635 --> 00:45:35.175
I'm gonna say that again.

00:45:35.175 --> 00:45:38.175
Don't be that guy or girl who
thinks he or she doesn't need God

00:45:38.175 --> 00:45:39.375
to guide and direct their life.

00:45:40.005 --> 00:45:42.645
Don't be that guy or girl who
thinks they cannot be forgiven

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:43.695
for what they have done.

00:45:44.625 --> 00:45:45.315
I'll just say it this way.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:50.355
Don't be that person who thinks
God is angry and just wants

00:45:50.355 --> 00:45:51.375
to destroy or punish you.

00:45:51.705 --> 00:45:54.885
Don't be that person who
thinks if God forgives you,

00:45:54.885 --> 00:45:56.115
you can never be used for him.

00:45:56.115 --> 00:45:58.785
Again, don't be that guy
who thinks repentance is a

00:45:58.785 --> 00:46:01.185
one time thing at salvation.

00:46:01.815 --> 00:46:04.935
don't be that person that thinks
someone should not be forgiven

00:46:04.935 --> 00:46:06.855
for what they've done, because
they sin differently than you.

00:46:07.725 --> 00:46:09.945
Don't be that person
who says I'll celebrate.

00:46:09.945 --> 00:46:13.515
When I know someone proves that
they've truly repented, don't

00:46:13.515 --> 00:46:15.825
be that person who thinks you're
better than those around you.

00:46:17.025 --> 00:46:21.135
And don't be that person who's too
stubborn to see the sin in your

00:46:21.135 --> 00:46:24.915
life and be unwilling to repent.

00:46:25.305 --> 00:46:27.045
What is God calling you to do today?

00:46:27.075 --> 00:46:29.895
There's so many things that I know I
don't, I it's a laundry list of things.

00:46:30.975 --> 00:46:36.524
Here's my challenge to you is that
you seek the Lord this morning,

00:46:36.795 --> 00:46:41.475
that you ask God what it is that
he wants to speak into your life,

00:46:41.924 --> 00:46:43.484
that he wants to challenge you in.

00:46:43.995 --> 00:46:45.975
This is what a time of
invitation's all about.

00:46:46.154 --> 00:46:48.975
It's an opportunity to reflect and say,
God, what did you speak to me about?

00:46:48.975 --> 00:46:52.095
And there was a lot of things
said, but my challenge is to take

00:46:52.095 --> 00:46:56.355
a next right step, lay down your
pride, ask God for forgiveness.

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:01.049
Turn your life back to him.

00:47:01.049 --> 00:47:02.819
Maybe give your life to
him for the first time.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.520
And, and I extend this
invitation every single week.

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:08.549
If you've never given your
life to Jesus and you wanna

00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:09.900
know what it is to follow him.

00:47:10.529 --> 00:47:11.549
I want you to talk to me.

00:47:11.549 --> 00:47:12.960
I want you to come and ask questions.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.060
I hang out in the back during invitation.

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.750
I hang out back next steps at the
end of service for you to come up

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:20.160
and say, Hey, I got a question.

00:47:20.609 --> 00:47:21.629
What does it mean to follow Jesus?

00:47:21.634 --> 00:47:23.339
I got a question I've been
struggling with this sin.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:24.810
How do I overcome it?

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:27.629
That's what I'm here for, to walk
with you through, but I'll just

00:47:27.629 --> 00:47:29.009
challenge you with this last statement.

00:47:29.009 --> 00:47:33.689
Before I pray for a pray don't delay.

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.870
You've heard enough truth today to know.

00:47:37.725 --> 00:47:40.725
that if you've sinned and you fall short
of God's glory and you haven't given your

00:47:40.725 --> 00:47:46.025
life to Jesus, you can, those are two
pieces that you have today, but don't say

00:47:46.545 --> 00:47:49.485
I'll do that tomorrow, or I'll do that
next week, or I'll do that next year.

00:47:49.845 --> 00:47:52.455
Today is the day of salvation
to give your life to Jesus.

00:47:52.515 --> 00:47:55.065
Today is the day to take
that next step in your faith.

00:47:55.065 --> 00:47:58.485
If you've been forgetting or, or
putting it off, I challenge you to

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:00.375
take that next step of faith today.

00:48:00.765 --> 00:48:01.755
So I'm gonna pray for us.

00:48:03.194 --> 00:48:04.305
And then we'll have a time of invitation.

00:48:04.305 --> 00:48:10.665
So Lord Jesus, we pray Lord that you, um,
open our hearts and minds to your truth.

00:48:11.774 --> 00:48:16.035
Lord, I pray that you, um,
encourage each one of us Lord.

00:48:16.935 --> 00:48:21.255
Um, To know you more Lord.

00:48:21.255 --> 00:48:23.775
I pray that through this word,
Lord, that each one of us has

00:48:23.775 --> 00:48:27.405
something that we can take home
with us to apply to our lives Lord.

00:48:27.405 --> 00:48:30.015
But I'm also wanting to speak to the
person in this room, Lord, maybe who

00:48:30.015 --> 00:48:34.095
has fallen away from the Lord or who
has never given the life to the Lord.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.035
Lord, I pray that today they take
that next step, uh, and begin

00:48:37.035 --> 00:48:40.485
to walk in faith to begin to
trust you with their, their life.

00:48:40.995 --> 00:48:44.745
Um, And, um, they give
their life to you Lord.

00:48:44.745 --> 00:48:46.905
So I pray that they have questions
about that Lord, that they'll

00:48:46.905 --> 00:48:49.245
come back and talk to me during
an invitation or after service.

00:48:49.905 --> 00:48:51.345
And so Lord, just pray
this in your family name.

00:48:51.825 --> 00:48:52.155
Amen.
