00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.970
We'll go ahead and jump
into the word today.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.370
Who's ready to finish up first.

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.440
Timothy, anybody, anybody
ready to finish up first?

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.030
Timothy Jonas.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.930
Okay, Noah.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.530
Okay, great.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.460
We got Lisa here.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.000
I feel like we got an auction here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.001
We're gonna.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.090
Bit it down.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.960
Well, I'm excited to be able
to finish up this letter, uh,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.210
that Paul wrote to Timothy.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.840
And, uh, there's a lot of reflection
that I've taken in this week, just

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.780
thinking through, uh, what we've learned.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.310
And as I begin to think through, um,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.760
There's been one person that's
guaranteed been in this room every

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.050
single week and heard every message.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.560
And that was me.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.590
And I'm still struggling to remember
everything that we took we covered.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.040
But in reflecting, one of the challenges
that we're gonna learn today is that

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.870
it's, it's important for us to think back
over what God has taught us in this book.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.915
Um, and I started thinking through this
thought, um, What's some of the last

00:00:57.915 --> 00:01:01.754
words that someone says before they
leave your house or get off the phone.

00:01:01.754 --> 00:01:03.644
What are some of the last words
that somebody usually says?

00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:05.265
And maybe it's somebody
that you're close to.

00:01:05.444 --> 00:01:07.425
What are some of the last words that
you say to somebody before you leave

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.685
their house or their, their home?

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:09.345
What you got?

00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:10.815
I love you.

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:11.414
That's a good one.

00:01:11.414 --> 00:01:12.075
What's another one.

00:01:12.884 --> 00:01:13.545
See you later.

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:13.875
Okay.

00:01:14.025 --> 00:01:16.785
What's some of the actions in which
somebody shows right before they

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:17.715
leave, especially someone they care.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.620
Wave.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.070
Okay.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.620
What's a more intimate a hug, right?

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.190
I would say this a lot of times, some
of our last statements and last actions

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.600
before we leave home, or we get off
the phone or we say by they're, they're

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.210
very what I would say important words,
because you're leaving a person or you're

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.100
gonna stop talking to a person in which.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.170
You'll see later, but
you're gonna miss them.

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.679
Right?

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.100
So you're showing some form of love or,
you know, I I'm gonna see you sooner.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.149
I'll miss you, whatever.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.759
So I started thinking about this
in this letter that Paul is writing

00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:52.229
to Timothy we're at the end of it.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.470
And Paul's gonna write, um,
a couple of different things.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.990
Number one, he's he is gonna talk to us
about two different things, but the first

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.320
one he's gonna talk about is he's gonna
be kind of summarizing up chapter six

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.550
and chapter six is talking about that.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.810
We need to understand the idea behind
godliness with contentment is great.

00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:11.925
Um, really dealing with this idea of these
false teachers who were trying to push,

00:02:12.285 --> 00:02:15.165
um, making money through being godly.

00:02:15.195 --> 00:02:15.645
Right.

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:19.905
Um, and, and trying to try, Paul's
trying to actually teach a really us

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:24.675
and Timothy and the people of Ephesus
to not focus on, uh, the love of money.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.740
And we're gonna continue to talk about
that, but he ends this letter really

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.440
with kind of summarizing this idea of,
to reject what the false teachers have

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:39.240
been pushing and to focus on what Paul
has been speaking to him and sharing

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.370
with him through, um, the word of God.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.000
And so, uh, it's this challenge, what I
would say this, these words are important

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
for us to say, Hey, let's listen to this.

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:52.695
As though they're some of the most
important words that Paul would have wrote

00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:54.674
to Timothy and that he's writing to us.

00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:58.635
And then take that with us to
say those words mean a lot to

00:02:58.635 --> 00:02:59.804
reflect on this whole book.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.125
Those words mean a lot to be able
to take with us to leave today and.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.260
And so with that thought, um, I
want us to look at just a little

00:03:07.265 --> 00:03:08.580
bit about what we covered last week.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.030
Last week, we talked about fighting
the good fight of faith, and there

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.150
was three things that we learned
that we could do to protect our

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.400
faith and our witness for Christ.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.340
And it was to flee, to
pursue and to fight.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.010
And if you remember, Paul
was saying to flee from these

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.800
false teachings and to pursue.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.500
Godly living to be more like Christ
godliness and to fight for our faith,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.230
knowing that we're in a battle every
day, that we need to continue to

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.700
fight for our faith, knowing how
important it is to not give up.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.470
And, and so he said to flee these things
because they would wreck your faith.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.940
And I I've said this, like nobody
goes into the way that they live.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.310
Choosing to wreck their
faith of their life.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.850
I think most of the time it happens
where we begin to drift and all of

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.940
a sudden we wreck our faith or all
of a sudden we make these decisions

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.440
that we go, how did we get here?

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.650
And majority of the time
it didn't happen overnight.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.330
It, it happened over a small, what I
would say is poor decisions over time.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.140
And so Paul's to fight against
making those poor decisions,

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.140
fight against following these
teachers and listening to them.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.630
And maybe beginning to, to do some
of the things they think or begin to

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.100
pursue some things you shouldn't pursue.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.630
And he says to take.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.930
And flee from those things
and to pursue the things in

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.970
which God calls you to pursue.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.900
And so I wanna kind of jump in off of
last week into the text we're in today,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.430
and then we'll cover the next section.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.040
So there's gonna kind of be
a two parts to this, which is

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.480
covering the end of chapter six.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.190
And then, then Paul's last statement.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.580
Um, and we'll kind of cover them separate
and then summarize it together at the end.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.020
So we're in first Timothy.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.360
Chapter six, we're gonna be
starting in verse 17 and I'll go

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.250
ahead and read through verse 21.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.900
And then we'll just start back at 17.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.070
So it says this, it says instruct
those who are rich in the

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.410
present age, not to be arrogant.

00:04:56.115 --> 00:05:01.815
Or to set their hope on the uncertainty
of wealth, but on God who richly

00:05:01.815 --> 00:05:07.275
provides us with all things to enjoy,
instruct them to do what is good to be

00:05:07.275 --> 00:05:11.565
rich in good works to be generous and
willing to share storing up treasures

00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:15.465
for themselves as a good foundation
for the coming age, so that they

00:05:15.465 --> 00:05:18.465
may take hold of what is truly life.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.520
Timothy guard.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.660
What has been entrusted to you?

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.490
Avoiding irreverent and empty speech
and contradictions from what is falsely

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.410
called knowledge by professing it, some
people have departed from the faith.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.080
Grace be with you all.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.890
So let's pray.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.000
Lord Jesus.

00:05:36.005 --> 00:05:37.140
We thank you for today.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.490
And we thank you for your word.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.510
Lord.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.230
I pray that this word sinks down in our
hearts, that each one of us can learn

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.730
today from your word to be challenged,
uh, to apply these things to our lives

00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:52.800
Lord, and then begin to live them out and,
uh, to begin to share those with others.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.990
And so Lord, uh, we pray
this in your heavily name.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.800
Amen.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.330
I mean, so the first thing that we
see as Paul is instructing the rich

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.090
as he instructs them to be humbled.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.070
So to humble themselves.

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:07.200
And so you'll see this in this
first part of the verse has instruct

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.620
those who are rich to in the
present age, not to be arrogant.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.320
So the opposite of
arrogant is to be humble.

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.640
Um, and so ask this question, how
many in here think you're rich?

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.510
See that's the problem in life.

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.859
Many of us think we're not rich.

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.109
So let ask this question,
put a number on it.

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:28.919
Somebody gimme a number.

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:30.570
What would you call rich?

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:31.979
How much do you gotta
make a year to be rich?

00:06:32.775 --> 00:06:37.395
200,300,000 million dollars.

00:06:37.395 --> 00:06:38.565
That's what you would call rich.

00:06:39.495 --> 00:06:39.825
Right?

00:06:40.455 --> 00:06:45.554
Well, what if, what you make and what
you have to the majority of the world

00:06:45.554 --> 00:06:48.284
is like a million dollars truth.

00:06:48.284 --> 00:06:56.205
Be told most of us in America compared
to the world live and have a million

00:06:56.205 --> 00:06:57.945
dollars in other people's perspective.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.580
We are rich.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.490
And the reason why I wanna bring that
up at first is, is we can look at this

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.090
text and we can say, Paul's instructing
Timothy to tell the church and to church

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.210
of today, those who are rich, do these
things, the moments you hear that,

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.650
and you don't define yourself as rich.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.940
You're gonna check out today.

00:07:12.359 --> 00:07:14.099
And if you don't check out
today, you're taking notes.

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:15.479
So you can go tell the rich what to do.

00:07:16.635 --> 00:07:18.075
so I wanna draw you back in.

00:07:18.794 --> 00:07:19.755
I want you to remember this.

00:07:19.815 --> 00:07:24.104
You are rich materially, but
I would also say spiritually

00:07:24.405 --> 00:07:25.724
because you have Christ, right?

00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:27.945
So Paul is speaking directly to us.

00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:32.505
So I'm glad that each one of you are back
in and you can now begin to look at this

00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:34.005
the way that I had to look at it as well.

00:07:34.364 --> 00:07:35.655
And so he talks about that.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:37.094
We should not be arrogant.

00:07:37.484 --> 00:07:42.705
And so the question is, why should
we not be arrogant when we are rich?

00:07:42.765 --> 00:07:43.635
Why shouldn't we be arrogant?

00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:44.534
Anybody have just.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.840
Great statement.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.219
Why shouldn't we be arrogant?

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.990
If we're rich,

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:55.680
somebody tell me what arrogant is.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.490
What is arrogant?

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.960
Prideful, boastful, right?

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.810
You almost like I earned this.

00:08:03.815 --> 00:08:04.590
It's all about me.

00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:08.159
Well, Deuteronomy eight 18 tells us this.

00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:13.980
It says, but remember that the Lord, your
God gives you the power to gain wealth.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.800
In order to confirm his covenant.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.480
He swore to your ancestors as it is today,
but he says, remember that the Lord, your

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.570
God gives you the power to gain wealth.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.800
He's the one that gave you the ability
to have whatever wealth you have, whether

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.990
you determine that to be rich or not, you
have it because the Lord gave it to you.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:39.000
If somebody gives that to you, you are
almost under really their authority

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.570
and, and, and, and really up to them,
whether they gave it to you or not.

00:08:43.395 --> 00:08:48.105
So for all of us to be arrogant,
well, to be act like you didn't

00:08:48.105 --> 00:08:51.314
gain your wealth from the Lord, but
that you gained it from yourself.

00:08:51.525 --> 00:08:53.085
And so he's saying don't be arrogant.

00:08:53.085 --> 00:08:55.425
You need to recognize
that God gave that to you.

00:08:55.425 --> 00:08:58.905
So it's important for us to
remember that we are not owners

00:08:58.965 --> 00:09:01.965
of our resources, but stewards.

00:09:02.194 --> 00:09:05.355
We're not owners of our
resources, but stewards.

00:09:05.954 --> 00:09:10.365
So if you know that you are a steward,
Of the resources in which God gives you.

00:09:10.365 --> 00:09:13.095
And so I'll just talk about resources,
time, talents, and treasures.

00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:14.595
Let's bring all those into the page.

00:09:15.045 --> 00:09:17.595
If every one of those are
given to you by God, and he has

00:09:17.595 --> 00:09:19.215
given them to you to steward.

00:09:20.115 --> 00:09:22.605
How does that change your
perspective with what you have?

00:09:24.195 --> 00:09:26.745
Does that change it for you
when you realize it's not yours?

00:09:26.745 --> 00:09:31.455
It's God's I mean, I think it
changes it for me because when it's

00:09:31.455 --> 00:09:33.075
mine, I'm a little bit selfish.

00:09:33.555 --> 00:09:34.965
Anybody here selfish at times.

00:09:36.735 --> 00:09:37.395
I know I am.

00:09:37.995 --> 00:09:41.145
And when I know something's
mine, I don't wanna give it up.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.285
Let me give you a great example.

00:09:42.495 --> 00:09:45.975
There's times when we go out to
eat with the kids and the kids get

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.745
their kids meals and I get the steak
and here's what my kids ask me.

00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:51.915
Dad, can I have a bite?

00:09:52.455 --> 00:09:54.345
No, it's my steak.

00:09:55.485 --> 00:09:55.785
It's the thing.

00:09:55.785 --> 00:09:57.105
Cost $25.

00:09:57.585 --> 00:09:58.335
I'm gonna eat it.

00:09:59.235 --> 00:10:00.615
And all of a sudden, the Lord convicts me.

00:10:01.785 --> 00:10:02.775
It's not your stake.

00:10:03.255 --> 00:10:06.075
God gave us like, so it's,
it's sometimes I'm selfish.

00:10:06.615 --> 00:10:08.625
You guys probably relate.

00:10:09.285 --> 00:10:14.385
But when we realize what we have is ours
in the, and because of God's giving it to

00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:16.275
us and then he is called us to steward it.

00:10:17.415 --> 00:10:19.065
Then that changes our perspective.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.325
And I want to kind of
answer this question.

00:10:20.325 --> 00:10:21.165
What is a steward?

00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:25.485
Someone who is responsible for
someone else's stuff, resources or.

00:10:26.775 --> 00:10:30.045
So the wealth that the Lord gives
us should humble us, not make

00:10:30.045 --> 00:10:32.415
us prideful or arrogant, right?

00:10:32.415 --> 00:10:35.025
So we should be giving
God glory, not ourselves.

00:10:35.445 --> 00:10:40.275
When we realize the wealth, the time the
talents and treasures are gods given to

00:10:40.275 --> 00:10:43.365
us to be used for his glory and our good.

00:10:43.815 --> 00:10:47.055
So I started thinking about this,
the breath that I have, the breath

00:10:47.055 --> 00:10:50.775
that you have, the abilities that
you have, cuz here's the cool part.

00:10:50.955 --> 00:10:54.345
As I get to know more and more of you,
you guys are gifted and passionate.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.670
You've got a heart for Jesus and a heart
for a lot of people that is amazing.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:05.430
But every bit of that is
from God to be stewarded.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:09.960
Well, it's not your own, it's
his, that changes our perspective.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:16.590
So how, how do you begin to now change
this mentality that the wealth in

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.740
which you have is actually God's.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.180
How do you attribute that?

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:21.990
How can we even know.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.850
I think it's that point of realizing
that, you know, and I've told this to,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.210
to a lot of people is how we have to
realize is that what we have is, is

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.680
not God's cuz I had, what was that?

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.400
Where, where was I at?

00:11:32.405 --> 00:11:34.980
There was some kid that I said
something, God makes everything the

00:11:34.985 --> 00:11:37.710
kid said, no, he doesn't, he doesn't
make, I don't remember what it was.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.310
And I was like, well.

00:11:38.685 --> 00:11:41.745
He makes the resources to have that
is in order for us to understand

00:11:41.745 --> 00:11:44.535
everything we have is from God,
is we have to start realizing

00:11:44.535 --> 00:11:46.455
that God created everything right.

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:50.355
If we go to the basis, if God
created every single thing, that

00:11:50.355 --> 00:11:53.805
means he created every ability for
you to have the resources you have.

00:11:53.805 --> 00:11:55.455
Most of us say, well, God,
didn't gimme the resources.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.115
I work hard.

00:11:56.805 --> 00:11:58.395
Well, who gave you the
ability to work hard?

00:11:58.725 --> 00:11:59.115
God.

00:11:59.805 --> 00:12:02.055
So you have to kind of come
back to that to realize that.

00:12:02.295 --> 00:12:06.195
So there's a couple of ways
that we can look at the idea of.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.599
This, this idea behind
having riches or wealth.

00:12:09.599 --> 00:12:11.729
And again, going back to this, he
says, instruct those who are rich

00:12:11.729 --> 00:12:15.630
in the present not to be arrogant
or humble is we can be rich in this

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.390
life on our own and be selfish.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.120
And we had the option
if to do that, right.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.020
We can be selfish.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.579
We can claim that it's all of our own.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:27.915
The rich in this life with that mentality
will give us a poor life in eternity.

00:12:28.365 --> 00:12:31.725
Well, then we can also be poor in
this life and be rich in eternity.

00:12:31.725 --> 00:12:31.965
Right.

00:12:31.965 --> 00:12:34.755
Which means we can just be generous
and we can give everything away.

00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:38.834
But then there's some people that try
to use that as if I'm poor, then that's

00:12:38.834 --> 00:12:42.765
what justifies me, but that's not what
God wants, but I believe there's a

00:12:42.765 --> 00:12:44.355
way for us to be rich in this world.

00:12:44.685 --> 00:12:49.814
And in the next, if we're rich in
building up God's kingdom, we'll

00:12:49.814 --> 00:12:51.765
be rich in seeing God's kingdom.

00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:56.865
Luke 2 12 18 says this from
everyone who has been given

00:12:56.865 --> 00:12:59.205
much, much will be required.

00:12:59.475 --> 00:13:04.175
And from the one who has been entrusted
with much even more will be expected.

00:13:05.235 --> 00:13:08.295
Every single one of us in
this room has been given much.

00:13:09.675 --> 00:13:12.825
We're all rich in this world, whether
you believe or not, you're rich in this

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:17.115
world financially, but I would also say
spiritually, if you've heard the gospel,

00:13:17.205 --> 00:13:19.045
then you've been given a message of hope.

00:13:19.845 --> 00:13:23.475
They can never be taken away from
you, whatever little we may have, we

00:13:23.475 --> 00:13:27.255
can use it to glorify God and invest
in the eternal riches we can gain.

00:13:28.185 --> 00:13:29.115
So how do we do that?

00:13:29.835 --> 00:13:32.205
It starts by humbling ourselves
and recognizing that all

00:13:32.205 --> 00:13:33.225
we have is from the Lords.

00:13:33.225 --> 00:13:35.955
And so going back to this, Paul and
instructs, those who are rich to

00:13:35.955 --> 00:13:39.855
humble themselves, not be prideful
and arrogant to live every day.

00:13:39.855 --> 00:13:45.015
As though God has given you your breath,
your life, your abilities, your resources,

00:13:45.015 --> 00:13:48.735
and your time to you to steward well.

00:13:49.515 --> 00:13:53.474
The second thing that he instructs those
for rich is to put their hope in God.

00:13:53.474 --> 00:13:55.995
And this is where we see
the second part of, uh, 17.

00:13:55.995 --> 00:14:00.704
So he says, instruct those who are rich in
the present age, not to be arrogant or set

00:14:00.704 --> 00:14:06.104
their hope on the uncertainty of wealth,
but on God who richly provides all things.

00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:11.745
So he says, do not put your hope in the
uncertainty of wealth, but on God who

00:14:11.745 --> 00:14:14.354
richly provides for everything, right.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.704
Provides us with all things.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:21.510
You guys ever try, um, or not try you
guys ever struggle with being generous.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:29.280
I mean, like where you see somebody that
has a need and you're like, eh, I, I

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.839
could use that money on something else.

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:35.610
I mean, again, I, I know I'm stepping
out there to challenge you on this idea,

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.550
but like sometimes we just struggle
to really trust God that, that if we

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.640
gave it away, would we have enough
leftover to do what we need to do?

00:14:42.689 --> 00:14:45.510
I look at this same thing as that's
the idea of trust, the same thing

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.630
with our money, but it's also do
you trust giving away your time?

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.229
There's sometimes where somebody asks
me, Hey, will you go to lunch with me?

00:14:52.229 --> 00:14:53.040
Will you hang out with me?

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.280
Where?

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.109
And I go, is it worth it?

00:14:56.459 --> 00:14:58.050
Because I, I have all these
other things I wanna do.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.910
And then I realize, okay, what's
the return on it is, is God

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:03.900
gonna give this back to me?

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.359
And I started thinking,
God stepped the sun.

00:15:06.359 --> 00:15:06.750
Didn't he.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.750
To for a battle to be won again.

00:15:09.755 --> 00:15:11.130
If you don't know the story,
go back to the old Testament.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.450
He literally stopped the son.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.510
So the battle could be won again.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.170
If the Lord leads you, he's given you the
resource of time, talents, and treasures,

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:24.570
then we should give it knowing that the
Lord, if, if need will have that time to

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.180
finish that up, let me ask this question.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.180
Are you struggling to find hope and
God, and to trust him with all the

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.740
high gas prices inflation going on?

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.540
I mean, you must be blind if you haven't
went to a gas station lately and realized

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:41.760
that your pain doubled the amount
you paid not long ago, and all of a

00:15:41.765 --> 00:15:45.660
sudden your budget goes out the window
and you're like, what are you doing?

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.490
God, you must have gotten this wrong.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.199
Go back and change it.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.800
Right.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.610
But we trust, we, we struggle to
trust God in these situations.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.480
So why do you guys believe
that we struggle to trust God,

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.290
cuz this is what he's saying.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:02.339
Those who are rich should put their
hope in God we're rich, but we

00:16:02.339 --> 00:16:05.130
struggle to put our hope in God in
the areas of, of finance, especially

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.670
whenever it comes to things, we feel
like that, that we can't control.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.680
How, how, why do we lose trust?

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.670
Why do we struggle to have trust in.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.450
Because we're weak.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.280
I heard you kinda let you gotta speak up.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:17.880
I'm gonna call you.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.420
That's good.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:18.990
Yeah.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:19.360
Yeah.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:19.740
Okay.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:20.460
That's good.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:21.600
What else?

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:23.880
Lack of faith.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.900
We don't understand.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.780
We think we have control.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.150
That's a great one guys.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.570
I'm I'm, I'm telling you, I'm
one of the worst at control.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.300
I love having control of
things and you know what?

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:36.810
God does.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:38.010
Many times he laughs at.

00:16:38.775 --> 00:16:41.415
Now you, you think, do you
actually hear God laughing at you?

00:16:41.595 --> 00:16:44.745
Yes, because when I fall flat of
my face, because I can't control

00:16:44.745 --> 00:16:46.665
something, God goes, ha told you so.

00:16:47.115 --> 00:16:49.755
And it's not because he's
like wanting, he's like really

00:16:49.755 --> 00:16:50.805
wanting me to remember that.

00:16:50.985 --> 00:16:55.935
I need to put my hope in God, not in
myself or in resources, but we typically

00:16:56.385 --> 00:17:01.065
don't put our hope in God or our trust
in God, because we think we have control.

00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:03.045
We think we can fix it.

00:17:04.964 --> 00:17:07.635
But I realized this, that
our perspectives are limited.

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:12.974
When we wonder what God's doing, our
perspectives are limited when we don't

00:17:12.974 --> 00:17:16.244
wanna be generous, our perspectives
are limited, but do you know whose

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:17.984
perspective is not limited to anybody?

00:17:18.974 --> 00:17:24.194
God's God knows eternity past forward.

00:17:24.285 --> 00:17:25.365
He knows the present.

00:17:25.575 --> 00:17:28.905
God cares more about your
tomorrow than you do.

00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:32.565
And I'm worried tomorrow
might be gas at five 15.

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:35.114
Maybe it's gonna be $5 and 30 cents.

00:17:35.115 --> 00:17:35.805
Maybe it's gonna be six.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:36.435
I don't know.

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.765
But there's days where I
begin to stress about that.

00:17:39.765 --> 00:17:43.515
And it's because I'm focusing on what
I can control, which means I only have

00:17:43.515 --> 00:17:47.955
a certain amount of money, but God
has unlimited amount of resources.

00:17:48.705 --> 00:17:51.495
So it's not like we're going to be
crazy, but we have to realize that

00:17:51.495 --> 00:17:55.155
we need to put our trust and hoping
God, whose perspective isn't limited.

00:17:55.425 --> 00:17:56.655
So let me give you two examples.

00:17:56.745 --> 00:17:58.725
I just wanna challenge you in this again.

00:17:59.685 --> 00:18:03.555
Examples of where I stressed out and
didn't put my trust in God and then God

00:18:03.555 --> 00:18:08.385
came through and I always say the, these
examples of, of does God always have to

00:18:08.385 --> 00:18:10.395
come through and bless you like crazy.

00:18:10.395 --> 00:18:11.355
No, he doesn't.

00:18:11.565 --> 00:18:12.645
But he, he, he comes through.

00:18:12.645 --> 00:18:15.555
So I mentioned, I think at one
point in, in my message about,

00:18:15.764 --> 00:18:18.465
in the midst of building a
home, we decide to build a home.

00:18:18.465 --> 00:18:21.375
We signed the contract
interest rates are like 2.99.

00:18:21.375 --> 00:18:22.125
This is great.

00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:23.385
Let's go.

00:18:23.745 --> 00:18:25.395
But like, why don't you lock in later?

00:18:25.425 --> 00:18:26.965
I'm like, yeah, let's lock in later.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:32.220
So all of a sudden interest rates
are 5% and I'm freaking out every

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.540
day, I'm following interest rates.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.790
I'm talking to Brittany,
I'm calling banks.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:36.750
What can you do?

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:37.530
You know what?

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.310
They're no help.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.440
Stressing was no help.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.010
All it did was cause me to be
distracted all of a sudden,

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:44.880
here's what the Lord said.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.900
Do you trust me here?

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:52.200
It's always interesting what God will
remove or not give you clarity in.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.330
And here's what he's
doing when he does that.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:55.120
Do you trust me?

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.730
And I'm just telling you at times
going, no Lord, I don't trust you there.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.230
And he is like, I know, but will
you and there came that moment

00:19:07.235 --> 00:19:08.220
where like, Lord, I trust you.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.090
It's like April.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.020
I'm like, I trust you.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.700
I stopped looking at interest rates.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.480
Like I'm done until the moment that
we needed to lock this rate in,

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.990
I'm done call back at 45 days out.

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.340
I'm like, all right, what can we.

00:19:21.254 --> 00:19:23.535
Somehow they worked it out and got
our interest rates sound, you know,

00:19:23.535 --> 00:19:27.375
our payment's literally gonna be what
we've been saving back each month.

00:19:27.675 --> 00:19:30.585
I don't know how, like, I don't
know how, but God does that

00:19:30.615 --> 00:19:31.754
because my perspective was limited.

00:19:31.785 --> 00:19:32.475
I was stressing out.

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:36.254
I was trying to figure out how to get 10
more jobs and to find a way to probably

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.955
cuss out the interest rate people
because that would've worked right.

00:19:39.075 --> 00:19:41.865
And that would've been ungodly,
but I had to trust God and

00:19:41.865 --> 00:19:42.885
realize that's not the way to go.

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:43.815
Cause that was ungodly.

00:19:44.205 --> 00:19:46.215
And to trust him, It's just truth.

00:19:46.755 --> 00:19:51.615
I go back to even moments like this that I
think are, are, are in, in all reality, go

00:19:51.615 --> 00:19:54.345
back to, um, my daughter that was Tegan.

00:19:54.345 --> 00:19:56.025
If you don't know her,
Teagan's our youngest daughter.

00:19:56.355 --> 00:20:00.015
Um, whenever she was young,
she life flighted emergency

00:20:00.015 --> 00:20:02.295
room and her life was bleak.

00:20:02.325 --> 00:20:03.705
It looked like she was not gonna live.

00:20:03.705 --> 00:20:04.665
And I remember those moments.

00:20:04.665 --> 00:20:07.155
We were just crying out to God
saying, God, what are you doing?

00:20:08.175 --> 00:20:09.525
Like, God, this is stupid.

00:20:10.725 --> 00:20:13.004
But in those moments, you know
what God gave us peace with.

00:20:13.274 --> 00:20:18.405
He said, in her life, or in her death,
he's gonna do something through it.

00:20:18.615 --> 00:20:21.135
We were able to have a piece
in the midst of that, because

00:20:21.135 --> 00:20:22.425
our perspective was limited.

00:20:22.425 --> 00:20:24.014
We didn't know why God would do this.

00:20:24.284 --> 00:20:25.064
God saved her.

00:20:25.274 --> 00:20:28.004
And you know, in the end of end
result, I'm so thankful he did.

00:20:28.004 --> 00:20:31.245
But in that middle of that, we
trust that God was doing something

00:20:31.245 --> 00:20:34.514
more through that story than
just saving our daughter or not.

00:20:35.745 --> 00:20:37.725
And how did we end up
seeing that perspective?

00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:41.205
We begin to trust God and God
begin to, to lead people into

00:20:41.205 --> 00:20:42.825
our lives that their faith grew.

00:20:42.945 --> 00:20:46.275
We got to have spiritual conversations
with doctors that we never would've had.

00:20:46.425 --> 00:20:50.565
Our church showed up through prayer
and through giving and all these

00:20:50.565 --> 00:20:53.295
things to meet the needs that
we would've never experienced.

00:20:53.805 --> 00:20:55.755
Apart from that I'm telling you.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.240
I know those are two examples that says,
God blessed you, God provided for you.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.150
And on the other side of that,
there are other examples where

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:04.710
God hasn't shown up in my life.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.640
And what I mean by that is he didn't
answer the prayer the way I wanted to.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.150
But you know what I realized my
perspective was limited because if

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.570
he would've given me that resource,
if he would've given me that job, if

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:19.920
he would've given me that, whatever,
I would've regretted it, he withheld

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.270
it because he knew it was better.

00:21:22.005 --> 00:21:26.265
I say all that to say this, we are
rich, this is what Paul's saying.

00:21:26.355 --> 00:21:27.525
We are rich.

00:21:28.365 --> 00:21:33.105
And we sure to put our hope in God,
because we have a limited and narrow

00:21:33.105 --> 00:21:35.595
mind of the perspective of our lives.

00:21:35.745 --> 00:21:39.405
Our lives are more important to
God because we are his resource.

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:44.115
He is literally left the
gospel message with us to share

00:21:44.115 --> 00:21:45.225
and to spread to the world.

00:21:45.795 --> 00:21:47.265
Do you think he cares about you?

00:21:48.045 --> 00:21:48.765
100%?

00:21:48.765 --> 00:21:49.395
He does.

00:21:49.755 --> 00:21:51.135
So when you're stressing out.

00:21:52.065 --> 00:21:53.175
No, you're not the only one.

00:21:53.175 --> 00:21:58.095
Number one, number two, know that your
heavenly father knows what you need

00:21:58.605 --> 00:22:00.735
and he will provide what you need.

00:22:01.485 --> 00:22:04.995
And sometimes what we need is
different than what we think we need.

00:22:05.835 --> 00:22:06.765
That's a tough one to hear.

00:22:08.895 --> 00:22:12.855
So Luke 12, 13 through 21 says this,
this is a good, long, long verse.

00:22:12.855 --> 00:22:17.145
Luke, Luke, Luke 12, 13 through 21
says this, someone from the crowd

00:22:17.145 --> 00:22:21.465
said, te said to him, Tell my brother
to divide the inheritance with me.

00:22:21.705 --> 00:22:22.965
And this is Jesus responding.

00:22:22.965 --> 00:22:27.284
He says friend, he said to
him who appointed me judge,

00:22:27.284 --> 00:22:28.605
or arbitrator over you.

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:34.274
He then told them, watch out and be on
guard against all greed because one's life

00:22:34.514 --> 00:22:36.554
is not in the abundance of possessions.

00:22:37.004 --> 00:22:38.155
Then he told them a parable.

00:22:38.685 --> 00:22:42.435
A rich man's land was very productive
and he thought to himself, what should

00:22:42.435 --> 00:22:46.425
I do since I don't have anywhere
to store my crops, I will do this.

00:22:46.425 --> 00:22:49.305
He says, I will tear down my barns
and build bigger ones and store

00:22:49.305 --> 00:22:50.595
all my grains and goods there.

00:22:50.805 --> 00:22:54.765
Then I'll say to myself, you have many
goods stored up for many years, take it

00:22:54.765 --> 00:22:57.075
easy, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.

00:22:57.375 --> 00:22:59.745
But God said to him, you
fool this very night.

00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:04.125
Your life is demanded of you and
the things you have prepared whos.

00:23:04.125 --> 00:23:04.705
Will they be.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.760
That is how it is with the one who
stores up treasures for himself

00:23:08.939 --> 00:23:10.379
and is not rich towards God.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.260
So here's this challenge with that verse.

00:23:13.379 --> 00:23:16.800
The reason why I'm sharing that is when
we forget that God is the one of the

00:23:16.804 --> 00:23:18.689
provider of the riches that we have.

00:23:19.379 --> 00:23:23.820
And he is the one that is not called us to
store them up and keep them to ourselves.

00:23:24.179 --> 00:23:28.020
We have to remember who member
who the giver of wealth is.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:28.770
It's not us.

00:23:28.919 --> 00:23:30.540
It's not only under our control.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.560
It's under, God's.

00:23:32.639 --> 00:23:35.730
So when we begin to store it up,
we don't trust God we'll provide

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.930
more to accomplish his work.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.010
This is where I'll come back to.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:41.760
I've told people this all the
time, you need to give financially.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.490
So you're saying, Hey, the pastor
from the pulpit saying to give a

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.170
tithe, I'm challenging you to tithe.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.399
I'm challenging you to give why?

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:51.030
Because I personally have seen that
every single time that I've given

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:53.730
that I've never lacked resources.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:54.960
Why?

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.370
Because I've trusted.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:01.649
God, God was the one that gave the
100% and I've given back a portion of.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.530
So ever since me and Brittany
back, whenever we were young in

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.020
our faith, we started going to
church and we started deciding to

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.030
tithe and give 10% of our income.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:13.740
I've always told people this God has given
us more with 90% than he ever did with the

00:24:13.745 --> 00:24:14.910
a hundred percent that we would've kept.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.130
My, my thought with that.

00:24:17.135 --> 00:24:19.680
My, my challenge with that
is try the Lord in this.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:20.230
Be generous.

00:24:21.225 --> 00:24:23.415
Again, are we talking about,
you're gonna go get a Porsche

00:24:23.415 --> 00:24:24.465
next week because you're generous.

00:24:24.465 --> 00:24:25.695
That's not what I'm pushing here.

00:24:25.695 --> 00:24:28.125
And I believe that's not what Paul's
saying here either, but when we

00:24:28.125 --> 00:24:33.794
think that we have control over the
resources, we have, we, we forget that

00:24:33.794 --> 00:24:38.685
we're stewards it's God's and we have
the ability to meet needs and change

00:24:38.685 --> 00:24:40.064
lives by the way, in which we give.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:43.215
And I wanna challenge you even more,
more than finances, your time and your

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.665
talents and your treasures are even
more what God gives you every day.

00:24:46.725 --> 00:24:47.925
Give what you have.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.110
Give what you have.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:53.790
So Warren WEBY said this, he says,
if God gives us wealth, we should

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.310
trust him the giver, not the gifts.

00:24:56.315 --> 00:25:00.390
And so I'll say it this way, too many
times, we trust the creation money

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.160
rather than the creator, the one who
created money and the ability to possess

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.580
money's just paper that we've made value.

00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:11.595
God is the one that created everything.

00:25:11.985 --> 00:25:14.775
So we need to trust the
creator, not the creation.

00:25:15.285 --> 00:25:18.315
So Paul instructs, those who are rich
to be humble, to put their hope on

00:25:18.315 --> 00:25:20.055
God, not themselves for their wealth.

00:25:20.205 --> 00:25:21.225
And here's the fun part.

00:25:21.675 --> 00:25:23.445
He says to enjoy what God gives them.

00:25:23.445 --> 00:25:25.995
And so you'll see this, I'm gonna
read this verse all together on 17.

00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:30.315
He says, instruct those who are rich
in the present age, not to be arrogant

00:25:30.675 --> 00:25:34.425
or to set their hope on uncertainty
of wealth, but on God who richly

00:25:34.425 --> 00:25:37.425
provides us with all things to enjoy.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.150
There's times.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:43.110
I I'll just be honest with you young in
my faith, the moment that I gave my life

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.960
to Christ, I thought I couldn't enjoy
the possessions I had because I thought

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.070
God only wanted people who were poor,
who had nothing gave everything away.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.600
And that's what we should be happy with.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.710
Now if that's what God leads you to
do, do it, but that's not the truth.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.320
He actually says to enjoy
what God has given you.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:03.360
It's not bad to enjoy it, but here's
what he's trying to warn against,

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:09.240
but we should not worship in those
things or trust them as though they're

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.860
more important than the creator.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:15.300
Not as that, if it leads us
to sin, we should avoid that.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:15.600
Right.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.130
We should not enjoy those things.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.150
If it leads us away from the.

00:26:19.395 --> 00:26:20.745
and I always tell people
the great example.

00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:23.685
If you have a boat, this is not
against you, but you get a boat.

00:26:23.685 --> 00:26:24.435
What, what happens then?

00:26:24.435 --> 00:26:26.055
Now you gotta have a place to store it.

00:26:26.535 --> 00:26:27.525
You gotta keep insurance on it.

00:26:27.525 --> 00:26:29.625
Most of the time you don't use it, right.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:34.065
Then you gotta upkeep every year and
it becomes to, and that's just one of

00:26:34.065 --> 00:26:36.765
great example, but we begin to purchase
things and buy things and all this

00:26:36.765 --> 00:26:38.715
wealth that takes away so much of our.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.100
We have no time left for God.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:42.840
We have no resources left for God.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.940
So he is saying like, enjoy what God gives
you, but don't let those things distract

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.340
you from what God's called you to in that.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.930
So we can, yes, we can enjoy those things.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:57.360
And even Ecclesiastes 2 24 says there
is nothing better for a person than

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.340
to eat, drink and enjoy his work.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.000
I have seen that even the lure or
even this is from the God's hands.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.420
And I would even say this, this
is why we give thanks during mill.

00:27:07.665 --> 00:27:10.334
Is because we can enjoy
the food that we have.

00:27:10.395 --> 00:27:12.705
I do like steak, even when
I have to give someone to my

00:27:12.705 --> 00:27:15.435
kids, I do like drinking Pepsi.

00:27:15.794 --> 00:27:16.034
Okay.

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:16.455
Yes.

00:27:16.725 --> 00:27:17.415
Sweet tea too.

00:27:17.419 --> 00:27:18.675
But I try to avoid those things.

00:27:18.794 --> 00:27:21.675
I enjoy some of those things and he says
to enjoy those, but won't let those.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.450
Distract you from what
God's called you to.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.429
I know I've struggled
with this in the past.

00:27:26.639 --> 00:27:30.419
I know many of you may struggle with this
as well, but God has given us these things

00:27:30.419 --> 00:27:33.149
to enjoy, but not to worship over him.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:37.950
So I realized as we've be given these
resources, they're first to serve him.

00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:41.740
And then the second is to enjoy and thank
him for what he's allowed you to have.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:42.990
With that.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.530
So Paul instructs, those who are rich
to humble themselves, put their hope

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.600
in God, enjoy what God gives them in.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.980
The last part of this section is to use
what God gives them to build his kingdom.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.600
And this is in verses 18 and 19.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:00.840
So it says this instruct them to do what
is good to be rich and good works to be

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.710
generous and willing to share storing
up treasures for themselves as a good

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:09.480
foundation for the coming age, so that
they may take hold of what is truly.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.570
So we've been given these three
resources that we talked about,

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.190
time, talents and treasures.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.400
We need to put these to
work for the glory of God.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.650
So he says to instruct
them to do what is good.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.640
And this is what I love about averse
that really lays itself out really well.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:25.950
It says instruct them to do what is good.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:27.030
Well, what is good?

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.520
He says to be rich in good works.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.040
How do you define good works?

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.110
How would you define good works

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:39.090
anybody?

00:28:42.405 --> 00:28:42.945
Serving.

00:28:43.034 --> 00:28:43.395
Okay.

00:28:47.385 --> 00:28:48.165
Benefits others.

00:28:48.165 --> 00:28:48.495
Right.

00:28:48.524 --> 00:28:48.794
Okay.

00:28:48.824 --> 00:28:49.274
Good.

00:28:50.415 --> 00:28:51.225
Anything else?

00:28:54.855 --> 00:28:55.665
Glorifies God.

00:28:55.725 --> 00:28:58.965
Yeah, those are the two pieces I
would say, right when he talks about

00:28:58.965 --> 00:29:02.085
to be rich in good works it's things
that don't benefit necessarily us,

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.435
but they benefit others, right.

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:06.945
Things that benefit the God's
kingdom, showing others Christ.

00:29:07.514 --> 00:29:09.585
And then he says to be
generous and willing to share.

00:29:10.679 --> 00:29:11.909
So, how can we be generous?

00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:12.990
We've already talked about that, right?

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.290
To be giving not only to the church,
but also to those around us and

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.979
meeting the needs of the people around
us that God has placed in our life.

00:29:20.429 --> 00:29:22.620
So he says be generous
and willing to share.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.219
And so does anybody know
what it takes to be generous?

00:29:26.219 --> 00:29:33.330
Anybody just be generous again, we
we've probably all put a number on it.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.790
If I made X, I would give,
if I had, I would do this.

00:29:40.379 --> 00:29:43.830
But it literally just takes generosity
to be generous, no matter what

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.679
your income level is, no matter
how much time you have, no matter

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:49.560
whatever talent you have, you can be
generous with what God's given you.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.340
Because again, we have to realize
that we are rich in Christ

00:29:53.969 --> 00:29:54.840
and compared to the world.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.830
We're definitely rich.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.679
So then the last one in verse 19, he says
storing up treasures for themselves as

00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:03.689
a good foundation for the coming age.

00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:06.315
So that they may take hold
of what truly is life.

00:30:06.885 --> 00:30:09.555
So if you just start with this
first part, you know, it's,

00:30:10.155 --> 00:30:11.445
he's saying it's good works.

00:30:11.445 --> 00:30:12.835
It's a store of treasures for yourself.

00:30:13.275 --> 00:30:16.935
That doesn't sound right, but
he's talking about where are

00:30:16.935 --> 00:30:18.075
we storing those treasures up?

00:30:18.165 --> 00:30:21.975
And if you look at it, they're storing
up treasures for themselves as a

00:30:21.975 --> 00:30:27.435
good foundation for the coming age
building God's kingdom, investing in

00:30:27.435 --> 00:30:29.745
things that will build God's kingdom.

00:30:29.745 --> 00:30:31.635
Not yours, not ours.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.930
So it's that challenge.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.990
If what we do is good, will it store
up treasures for the glory of God,

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:44.670
not money or gold, but for souls, for
Christ, those who don't know Jesus, he

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.350
says that you may take hold of the life.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:46.890
That is real.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:52.710
And I love this statement that it may
take hold of a tr of what is truly life.

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.770
Every one of us is breathing air.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.260
And we would probably say we're
living, which is life, right.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:03.960
But what is truly life is that life
in which we are living for a future

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.899
in heaven with God and an eternity.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.770
And so when we think about this,
this life is a purpose filled life

00:31:11.189 --> 00:31:14.730
that will not only last this side of
heaven, but will last in eternity.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:20.370
That's what he's calling us to is to
invest and do good works that will

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:24.120
invest in more than just a life change
here, but in life change in eternity.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.640
So that's that section where
he is covering the last part.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.650
Chapter six and saying, Hey, make sure
we understand that guidelines with

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:38.610
contentment is great gain that, that the
riches of the world is not what should

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:42.120
consume us, but that we realize that
God is the giver of everything that we

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.140
have, and that we are to be generous.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.720
That is building God's kingdom.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:50.100
But his final words here are so
important and verse 20 and 21.

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:51.820
And he uses the word Timothy.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:52.840
I'm gonna kinda read these verse again.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.730
So we're kind of jumping in this, but
Paul's final word says Timothy guard.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.020
What has been entrusted to you?

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.100
Avoiding irreverent and empty speech
and contradictions from what is falsely

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.910
called knowledge by professing it, some
people have departed from the faith.

00:32:06.915 --> 00:32:08.080
Grace be with you all.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.590
I love how Paul uses
the word Timothy here.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:12.730
Parents.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:15.940
You probably have used that name of your
kids whenever you're getting onto 'em.

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.100
You know, typically
it's a two name, right?

00:32:18.105 --> 00:32:18.940
Chaining James.

00:32:19.245 --> 00:32:22.155
Peyton Alexis it's typically cuz
we're trying to get their attention.

00:32:22.605 --> 00:32:23.175
That's what we do.

00:32:23.175 --> 00:32:27.855
Well, I feel like Paul's in this text
at the end is almost like, all right,

00:32:27.855 --> 00:32:30.135
Timothy, you may have checked out
a little bit from this long letter,

00:32:30.495 --> 00:32:33.645
but Timothy, listen up, hear me out.

00:32:33.645 --> 00:32:34.635
Don't miss this.

00:32:35.445 --> 00:32:36.764
So this is my challenge to you.

00:32:37.274 --> 00:32:38.355
Listen up.

00:32:38.475 --> 00:32:39.435
Don't miss this.

00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:41.385
And then the next word's so important.

00:32:41.385 --> 00:32:43.544
He says Timothy guard.

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.375
What has been entrusted to you?

00:32:47.145 --> 00:32:47.594
Guard?

00:32:47.594 --> 00:32:48.435
What has been entrusted?

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:54.510
When I think of a guard, I think of
a big dude, couple of bouncer dudes

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.820
hanging out, making sure nobody gets
in that shouldn't be getting in.

00:32:56.825 --> 00:32:58.260
Right, right, exactly.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:59.070
Right.

00:32:59.075 --> 00:33:00.360
Maybe some guard dogs.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:05.190
I remember as a kid, my grandma had some
friends that they had these two huge

00:33:05.195 --> 00:33:07.470
dogs and they were their guard dogs.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:10.560
And I never wanted to enter in and go
over their house, but my grandma would

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.030
make me go and I was always so scared.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:12.300
Right.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.920
So in saying guard.

00:33:15.284 --> 00:33:18.915
What I have taught you, not only
in this letter, but Paul has

00:33:18.915 --> 00:33:21.794
spent a ton of time with Timothy
and he says, guard everything.

00:33:21.794 --> 00:33:23.294
I've taught you in journal.

00:33:24.165 --> 00:33:27.675
When we think about guarding something,
guys, we have been walking through

00:33:27.675 --> 00:33:32.264
this book and we've been given so many
practical things about how we should

00:33:32.264 --> 00:33:36.705
conduct ourselves in the church, but
then also how we should reject false.

00:33:37.875 --> 00:33:40.455
The things in which we've learned in
this book, if you don't remember them

00:33:40.455 --> 00:33:43.665
all, I encourage you to go read them
this week again, and I want you to

00:33:43.665 --> 00:33:45.855
begin to guard them, protect them.

00:33:45.855 --> 00:33:51.165
And I even think about this Joshua,
um, was challenged by God to meditate

00:33:51.525 --> 00:33:56.295
on the law day and night so that
his word would not depart from him.

00:33:56.805 --> 00:33:58.935
My challenge to you is to guard something.

00:33:59.235 --> 00:34:03.105
We've gotta know what we're guarding, and
if you don't know what you're guarding,

00:34:03.105 --> 00:34:04.515
you'll never know if you've guard.

00:34:05.205 --> 00:34:05.955
Does that make sense?

00:34:05.955 --> 00:34:07.095
I know this kinda level of confusing.

00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:10.035
So in order to know what to
guard that Paul's talking about

00:34:10.035 --> 00:34:11.775
here, we need to know the truth.

00:34:12.315 --> 00:34:13.845
So we need to meditate on God's words.

00:34:13.845 --> 00:34:15.195
We need to study it.

00:34:15.435 --> 00:34:16.365
We need to know it.

00:34:17.505 --> 00:34:18.765
We need to know it for more.

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:19.965
And this is what's so important.

00:34:20.745 --> 00:34:24.465
Timothy was not guarding this just to
keep it to himself and give him pep talks.

00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:27.465
Give himself pep talks every day,
even though we need that sometimes.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.840
He was guarding it for this, that
will learn in second Timothy.

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:34.770
And second Timothy two to, it says this,
Paul speaking to Timothy, what you have

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:38.610
heard from me in the presence of many
witnesses commit these to faithful men

00:34:38.615 --> 00:34:40.230
who will be able to teach others also.

00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:45.720
So Paul had given Timothy this challenge
to take this knowledge and guard it

00:34:45.725 --> 00:34:47.250
so that he can give it to others.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:52.290
He needed to protect it so that it
wouldn't get warped or changed into

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:53.400
the false teaching that was being.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:35:01.720
We now are part as inspiring hope church,
as followers of Jesus are now stewards

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.030
of the message of first Timothy to
take the messages and the truths that

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:09.930
we've heard and that we've learned, and
that we pass them onto someone else.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.070
We need to meditate on 'em.

00:35:11.075 --> 00:35:13.110
We need to memorize them
and we need to share them.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:16.110
We need to live them out
as examples to others.

00:35:17.504 --> 00:35:20.444
But if you don't remember, cause I I've
brought this up at the beginning, I

00:35:20.444 --> 00:35:23.834
literally preached every message and I'm
asking the question, what all did I learn?

00:35:24.464 --> 00:35:25.754
What do I need to apply?

00:35:25.904 --> 00:35:28.154
And I could give you a list
and you'd may forget as well.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.964
My challenge to you is take some
time this week, walk back to

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:36.464
the book of first Timothy, write
down what God is speaking to you.

00:35:36.794 --> 00:35:42.225
The grab, hold on to guard and to protect
so that you can share with others.

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:45.930
So he says to guard these things, right?

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:47.790
Why does he need to guard these things?

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.610
I think about this, Paul's
speaking about the positive first.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.080
Think about something you need to
be focusing on first guard, these

00:35:55.085 --> 00:35:56.880
things I've taught you focus on these.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:03.090
And then he says to avoid irreverent
and empty speech and contradictions

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:05.280
from what is falsely called knowledge.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.240
So he says now to avoid
anything that teaches contrary

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.170
to the things in which is.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.970
Guys, if we get that flipped around
and we're just trying to say no, no,

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.299
no avoid, avoid, avoid all of a sudden
we, what are we trying to avoid?

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.660
We don't remember what we're trying to,
cuz we didn't know what we were guarding

00:36:21.665 --> 00:36:25.380
and all of a sudden we're just lost
my challenge to, you know what you're

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:31.860
guarding, put your eyes on Jesus, then
reject or avoid these things that are

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.779
contrary to the teachings of God's word.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.640
It's a lot easier in that.

00:36:35.645 --> 00:36:37.590
That's why we believe Paul
is teaching it in this.

00:36:38.445 --> 00:36:42.615
So he is cautioning Timothy in the
church and us to avoid these type of

00:36:42.615 --> 00:36:48.495
teachings because verse 21 tells us, it
says this, it says by professing it, some

00:36:48.495 --> 00:36:53.025
people have departed from the faith when
they got caught up in these irreverent

00:36:53.085 --> 00:36:56.385
and empty speeches and contradictions
from what was falsely taught, they

00:36:56.385 --> 00:36:58.485
begin to walk away from their faith.

00:36:58.605 --> 00:37:04.095
They begin to believe in the things that
were not truth challenged for all of

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.725
us is that we need to know the truth.

00:37:09.555 --> 00:37:10.785
Always go back to the statement.

00:37:11.985 --> 00:37:14.355
If we can learn this from the government,
there's one thing we can learn.

00:37:14.925 --> 00:37:18.615
People who are trying to get rid of all
the fake money, the counterfeit money,

00:37:18.645 --> 00:37:20.265
they don't focus on the counterfeit money.

00:37:20.265 --> 00:37:23.745
They focus on what the real money
is, so that they can notice the

00:37:23.745 --> 00:37:25.035
counterfeit money when it comes in.

00:37:25.275 --> 00:37:26.985
This is not truth.

00:37:27.675 --> 00:37:33.405
The only way you're gonna know to reject
false teaching is to know what truth is.

00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:35.175
What is truth?

00:37:36.045 --> 00:37:36.975
It's in God's word.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:42.390
It's anything that puts Jesus first,
anything that says it is Jesus by

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:45.900
his grace and mercy, that saves
us that guides and directs us and

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.400
challenges us to go about our faith.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.000
And the more and more that I'm reading
as I'm walking through the book of,

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:54.330
uh, I think it was in, uh, second
Peter first, Peter is really talking

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:58.590
about false teachers and it is being
specific about what false teachers

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.420
are trying to lead us away from that.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:06.180
Jesus is not the way that grace is not
the way and that we need to lean into.

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:07.890
Who Jesus truly is.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.360
So what's our take home today.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:12.810
Obviously part one, we covered part
two pretty quickly, but part one

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.680
was just that conclusion of Paul's
instruction on those who are rich, right?

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:22.650
And we are those who are rich instructing
us to humble ourselves, put our hope

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:26.460
in God to enjoy what God gives us, but
to ultimately use what God has given

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:30.390
us to build his kingdom time, talent,
and treasures within Paul's final

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:34.259
words, it's to challenge us, to guard
and protect all that we have learned.

00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:38.505
All that we have learned not just on
Sunday mornings when you're in your quiet

00:38:38.505 --> 00:38:45.765
time guard and protect that so that you
can teach others so that you can reject

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:49.845
false truth so that you can know how to
conduct yourself as a follower of Christ.

00:38:50.775 --> 00:38:55.665
So as we have a time of invitation,
I always love just this time of

00:38:55.665 --> 00:38:57.615
reflection, cuz it's so important.

00:38:57.855 --> 00:39:01.545
This is what I do every single time that
I get an opportunity to write a message.

00:39:02.175 --> 00:39:03.585
I usually finish the message.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:05.595
I print it off and then I begin to pray.

00:39:06.075 --> 00:39:09.045
What is my take home as a pastor?

00:39:09.615 --> 00:39:12.225
What is it that God is teaching me?

00:39:12.645 --> 00:39:14.205
If we don't take time to reflect.

00:39:15.315 --> 00:39:19.605
Many of us will sit through classes just
like we did in college or high school.

00:39:19.605 --> 00:39:21.765
And we'll go, yeah, we get that.

00:39:21.765 --> 00:39:22.665
That's awesome.

00:39:22.755 --> 00:39:24.884
We walk out the door and
we forget everything.

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:27.375
If we were to take a test a week
later, we would forget everything.

00:39:27.555 --> 00:39:30.585
The only way you would've been ready
for that test is if you studied.

00:39:31.904 --> 00:39:35.895
So to me, this is time for you to reflect,
maybe take a little bit of time and take

00:39:35.895 --> 00:39:39.525
a spiritual inventory and write down
some things that God is teaching you.

00:39:40.215 --> 00:39:43.365
So I wanna challenge you during
this time of invitation to reflect.

00:39:43.995 --> 00:39:47.654
Maybe for you, it's to humble yourself,
to put your hope in God, in the

00:39:47.654 --> 00:39:49.605
area of finances, time and talents.

00:39:51.134 --> 00:39:54.674
It's easy to get distracted by those
things where we're not humble, what

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.444
we're prideful by what we have.

00:39:56.805 --> 00:40:00.255
And we begin to take it for granted
and we think we have control over

00:40:00.259 --> 00:40:04.605
that, but God's ultimately the one
that does maybe the second thing you

00:40:04.605 --> 00:40:08.295
need is that you need to use what God
has given you to build his kingdom.

00:40:08.295 --> 00:40:09.285
Maybe you've been avoid.

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:13.470
Giving your time, talents
and treasures to God.

00:40:14.009 --> 00:40:16.350
And today's the day where you're
like, Nope, I'm gonna take a step of

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:21.299
faith and I'm gonna begin to trust God
in those areas, trust that God will

00:40:21.299 --> 00:40:26.160
do more with what he leaves you to
steward right than what you give away.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.430
And if you give it away, knowing
that God will give it back again,

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:33.810
that time talents and treasures,
maybe part two for you that we talked

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:35.430
about here is that we need to apply.

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.310
Some of the principles about
conducting yourself in the church

00:40:38.315 --> 00:40:40.710
are how to avoid false teaching,
all the things that you've learned.

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:43.620
So maybe during this time invitation, you
need to reflect on what God has taught

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:50.700
you, and you need to commit to taking
what God has taught you and applying it

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.510
and sharing it with others around you.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:59.070
Memorize it, reread it, act on it.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:03.780
Think of the person that you're around
each day that needs to hear those truth.

00:41:04.695 --> 00:41:07.935
Write their name down and
say, I need to go talk to Joe.

00:41:07.935 --> 00:41:10.125
I need to go talk to Tammy, whoever it is.

00:41:10.125 --> 00:41:12.495
I need to go tell them the
truth that I've learned.

00:41:13.845 --> 00:41:17.085
The last one is for some of us
we've been walking through first

00:41:17.085 --> 00:41:21.105
Timothy, but maybe you've been
walking through life without Jesus.

00:41:22.065 --> 00:41:23.985
You've been walking
through life without hope.

00:41:24.345 --> 00:41:27.165
You've been missing out
on this freedom in Christ.

00:41:27.375 --> 00:41:30.375
Maybe you've been avoiding taking the
next step in your faith to give your

00:41:30.375 --> 00:41:35.265
life to Jesus, to be baptized, to take
your next step of faith, whatever it is.

00:41:35.625 --> 00:41:40.545
If that's you today during this time
of invitation, you can, you can pray

00:41:40.545 --> 00:41:44.445
and ask God to give you the boldness
to say yes to take that next step.

00:41:44.565 --> 00:41:45.855
You don't have to do it alone.

00:41:45.855 --> 00:41:47.205
That's what I love about a church.

00:41:47.565 --> 00:41:48.945
You don't have to do this alone.

00:41:48.945 --> 00:41:50.205
We can do this together.

00:41:50.865 --> 00:41:54.525
Linking arms encouraging one
another to take whatever next step

00:41:54.525 --> 00:41:55.665
that God is calling you to take.

00:41:56.384 --> 00:42:00.615
But I can't think of a greater
day than today to make that step.

00:42:02.025 --> 00:42:04.665
Don't let another day go by
before you take that step.

00:42:04.665 --> 00:42:07.935
So I'm gonna pray for us and then
we'll have a time of invitation.

00:42:08.595 --> 00:42:09.254
Lord Jesus.

00:42:09.259 --> 00:42:10.694
We just thank you Lord for today.

00:42:12.165 --> 00:42:13.395
And we thank you for your word.

00:42:13.395 --> 00:42:14.924
We thank you for first Timothy.

00:42:15.194 --> 00:42:19.395
We thank you, Lord that you gave
Paul the knowledge and the wisdom.

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:25.680
To write this letter to Timothy and that
it would also be written to us even today.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.669
So Lord, I just pray that
our hearts are opened.

00:42:30.629 --> 00:42:34.740
Um, Lord, that we have heard truth
during this, uh, serious Lord.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:40.319
I pray that even today that every person
can walk outta here being challenged

00:42:40.325 --> 00:42:45.899
in their faith, including myself,
Lord, help us, help us be humble.

00:42:47.129 --> 00:42:48.180
Lord, help us.

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:52.890
Place our trust in you and not in our
resources or the things in which we

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:55.500
have, or Lord let us trust in you.

00:42:56.430 --> 00:43:01.110
But ultimately, Lord, I just, I pray
over each person, Lord, I, if they

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:04.200
haven't given their lives to Christ,
they haven't given their lives to you.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:06.480
Lord, I pray that they do that today.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:11.280
Lord, that they put their hope and
faith in you and they say yes, and

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.480
they begin to take steps of faith.

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:13.560
Lord.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.710
I pray also for the person in this
room, Lord that is struggling to, to

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:19.710
take that next step of faith in their
boldness of, of just living out their

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:23.790
faith, to those around them, Lord,
whatever you're calling them to do.

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:27.060
Lord, I pray that they take it today
and Lord that they realize that

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.850
they have a church family to walk
alongside them to take that step.

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:35.010
So Lord, we love you and we praise you and
we pray all of this in your heaven name.

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:35.880
Amen.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:36.510
Amen.

00:43:37.755 --> 00:43:37.995
Right.
