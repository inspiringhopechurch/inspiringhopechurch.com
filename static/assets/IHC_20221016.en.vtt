Go ahead and jump in, uh, to today's text.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.910
If you wanna turn with
me, we'll be in Acts two.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.560
Uh, we're gonna be reading
versus 30, th 37 through 47.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.820
Uh, we'll spend the majority of our time
in versus 42 through 47, but we'll be

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.690
reading Acts chapter 2 37 through 47.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.895
Um, so last week we discussed,
um, The first part of our series.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:31.875
So our series is talking about next steps.

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:35.475
And one of the things, uh, because
obviously I'm consistently see

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:37.754
each and every week, we have
different people in and out that

00:00:37.754 --> 00:00:39.644
I'm gonna send these messages out.

00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:42.855
So, um, to those who aren't here,
and if you weren't here last

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:45.254
week, my encouragement is to go
listen to last week's message.

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:48.735
But in this next step series,
we're really walking through as a

00:00:48.735 --> 00:00:51.555
church, um, our strategy, right?

00:00:51.555 --> 00:00:53.025
We've been talking about
our mission, right?

00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:54.435
Our mission is to inspire.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.590
By helping people discover God's purpose
for their life through a relationship with

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.420
Jesus, we truly believe that the greatest
way that we can help people do that is

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.670
by following Jesus, living in community.

00:01:06.164 --> 00:01:09.044
Serving those around us and
expanding God's kingdom.

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:11.264
Um, and so that's kind of what
we've been walking through.

00:01:11.264 --> 00:01:15.554
So last week was following Jesus, and,
uh, Britt has been serving in kids last

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:19.544
week and this week, and she listened to my
message and she said, Well, here's a good

00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:21.104
thing about your message this last week.

00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:23.234
She said, You, you said
the name of Jesus a lot.

00:01:23.264 --> 00:01:25.755
And I said, Well, praise God
if I got something right.

00:01:25.994 --> 00:01:26.895
I did say that.

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:29.535
So, um, that is who we are as a church.

00:01:29.535 --> 00:01:32.714
And I would tell people this
is, um, we are unashamed.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.290
In, in our, our thoughts and our
conversations and what we talk

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.110
about, that Jesus changes our life.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.380
That everything we do flows out
of that relationship with Jesus,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.640
and that that's exactly why our
strategy is to follow Jesus.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.690
And that sounds so simple, yet so
complicated, all in the same sentence.

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:55.905
That's why we're here during
this series, to talk about why

00:01:55.905 --> 00:01:57.045
is it important to follow Jesus?

00:01:57.045 --> 00:01:58.995
What does that step,
what does that look like?

00:01:58.995 --> 00:02:02.055
And we talked about that last week,
but we get to talk about what I call

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:08.595
as the next step after following Jesus,
which we see the new believers in acts

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:12.555
and how they responded, what their
next step was after following Jesus.

00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:15.405
So we're gonna kind of jump into
that, and that is really when we

00:02:15.405 --> 00:02:17.625
talk about living in community.

00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:19.035
Living in community.

00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:23.145
And so I went out and looked at Webster's
Dictionary and it defines community

00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:29.805
as a unified body of individuals, such
as a group of people with a common

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.155
characteristic or interest living
together within a larger society.

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:38.205
So I'm gonna say that again, A unified
body of individuals, such as a group of

00:02:38.205 --> 00:02:43.575
people with a common characteristic or
interest living together in a larger.

00:02:45.015 --> 00:02:48.645
In just looking in that, I
think we can see obviously the

00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:50.655
idea behind community, right?

00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:56.135
A group of people that have common
interests and, and usually it's a, a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.915
group living within a larger group.

00:02:58.305 --> 00:03:01.995
And we at Inspiring Hope, talk
about the idea of living in

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:04.365
community as our inspired groups.

00:03:04.365 --> 00:03:07.335
We have inspire groups during the week
and we took off during the summer, but

00:03:07.335 --> 00:03:08.265
we're getting ready to start those back.

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.540
Um, and something that I lay to each one
of your seats somewhere around there.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.630
Um, and again, I'm gonna give this out
to everybody else that wasn't here today.

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.430
Um, but these cards are an opportunity
for you to fill out what night of the

00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:23.350
week might be good for you to be able
to be a part of an inspire group.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.600
And so what I do know is that it is
difficult to find a night for everybody.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.820
And so we are not necessarily
saying, Hey, if you mark down that

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.040
we're gonna create an inspire group
for you every night of the week.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.460
But what we're saying is we'd like to
know, number one, if you could attend

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.370
an Inspire group, which I would say
this, most of us could, if we could

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.320
choose the night or day in time, right?

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.400
So choose a couple of days and
options and then that lets us know.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.330
One, you're interest in the groups,
but two, the nights that you can do it.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.270
And then we're gonna see what we can
do to either have a group on that

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.210
night and if we can't, we're still
going to talk about how to waste to

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.770
connect with you on those nights.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.140
Um, but anyways, as we look at how
important community is, one of the cool

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.280
parts about Jesus, and this is what I
would say, like when I go and study God's

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.020
word, I go and see what did Jesus do?

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.460
Well, Jesus lived in community.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.650
See, after he started his
ministry, the first thing.

00:04:34.695 --> 00:04:38.625
All right, we'll wait a minute and see
if we can get everything rebooted back.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.500
I don't know.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.030
Should I even go on

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.410
Let there be light.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.040
There it is.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.530
In the beginning I didn't
start early enough in creation.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.250
Yes.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.610
Now we didn't do Okay.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.450
Okay, so Jason, do we have sound again?

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.870
Are we.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.580
At least got sound.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.060
I know that video's probably loading
back up and that may take a few minutes.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.290
You're good on video too.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.480
Okay, we're good on sound
cuz I don't hear anything.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.560
So that's the only thing I was gonna say.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.930
You got anything?

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:22.350
There we go.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.830
Hello.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.210
Okay, we are back.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.710
All right.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.430
Live in action.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.090
Where we go here.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.680
So Jesus, after.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.170
He started his ministry, right?

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.040
He was baptized, he was,
um, tested for 40 days.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.860
He came back and last week we saw, rather
than doing ministry alone, he said,

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.930
Let me go gather a community of people.

00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:48.870
And so he began to invite these men to
follow him in this community, to go be

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.100
a part of this awesome mission that each
one of us have been called to right?

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.230
To expand the gospel, to let people
know the love of Jesus around the world.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.990
So Jesus obviously had community.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.820
The only time you saw Jesus out of
community was when he was going away

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.650
to spend time with his father, right?

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.740
And so this is what we could say is,
so the only reason why we could justify

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.920
ourselves being away from community is
if we're alone with the Father, right?

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.370
We're alone with Jesus and we're growing
our personal relationship with Christ.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.430
But outside of that, he was
consistently in community.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.370
And we see even in the New Testament,
that same thing in the Book of

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.930
Acts and so on and so forth.

00:06:25.484 --> 00:06:30.825
I think when we look at this, that Jesus
taught us that we are better together.

00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:34.934
We're stronger together, where
it's an essential part of following

00:06:34.934 --> 00:06:36.945
Jesus', living in community together.

00:06:37.424 --> 00:06:41.474
And I look at this as Sundays as
one of those opportunities, and

00:06:41.474 --> 00:06:42.434
we'll learn more about that today.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.054
But really we would look at that.

00:06:44.054 --> 00:06:46.275
It's every day we have that opportunity.

00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:49.664
Um, and so, uh, I wanted
to ask this question.

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:51.015
I love asking questions to you.

00:06:51.015 --> 00:06:51.465
Why?

00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:52.755
What is the benefit?

00:06:54.015 --> 00:06:55.635
Of living in community with other people.

00:06:55.635 --> 00:06:56.475
What's the benefit?

00:06:59.655 --> 00:07:01.035
Support, What else?

00:07:07.005 --> 00:07:10.335
What's the benefit of living
in community with other people?

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:13.695
Accountability.

00:07:14.115 --> 00:07:14.625
What else?

00:07:18.135 --> 00:07:19.725
Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:20.505
What else?

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.050
Anything else?

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:28.710
Fun.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.020
Yeah, The hangout have fun, right?

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.130
Friendship, Um, encouragement,
spiritual growth and learning.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.410
So as, as we begin to think about
this, cuz I do things every day

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.190
because I see value in them and
the things I don't do every day are

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.930
the things I don't see value in.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.230
So at some point when we look
at this idea behind community

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:54.285
or living in community together,
It'll never be a part of our life.

00:07:54.285 --> 00:07:59.775
It'll never be an important part of our
life until we see how valuable it is.

00:08:00.195 --> 00:08:03.105
And so this is where we're gonna continue
to build off this idea that God has

00:08:03.105 --> 00:08:05.715
designed us for community, not isolation.

00:08:06.225 --> 00:08:09.375
And that's why we look at, even in the
beginning when he created Adam, he says

00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:10.875
it wasn't good for Adam to be alone.

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:11.025
Right.

00:08:11.025 --> 00:08:12.315
And that's where he created Eve.

00:08:12.795 --> 00:08:14.805
But even bigger than,
this is the cool part.

00:08:15.165 --> 00:08:20.055
When God sent Jesus to save us from our
sins, he created the body of Christ.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.720
You all know this, right?

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.140
We, we can't just function with
one part of our body working.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:31.590
The body works together best when
we're working together in community.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.080
And I go back to that definition.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.030
I know I haven't even started
really in the text yet, right?

00:08:36.034 --> 00:08:37.260
But I wanna set this up.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.650
Going back to that definition,
it's a unified body of individuals.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:41.610
This is a community, right?

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.940
A unified body of individuals,
such as a group of people with a

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.060
common characteristic or interest
living together within a larger.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:54.660
So the idea behind community is, and
the body of Christ is that we work

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.960
best functioning and living together.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.689
And that's exactly why God
created this idea behind community

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.900
and the body of Christ and how
important it is for each one of us.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.230
Um, and I wanna just, I just
just wanna think back to this

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.189
before we jump into this text.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.720
How critical to me when I started
thinking about living in community,

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.100
that piece has been in my.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:23.160
I believe I am who I am today because of
the communities that I've been a part of.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.250
Whenever I first gave my life to
Christ, the church that we were going

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.640
to, we started going to, um, we called
it small groups on Sunday morning,

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.230
and we went to a young Marri's class.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.620
And that was a class where me and
Britney really grew in our faith

00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:35.760
and we were really challenged.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.510
And out of that we went with another,
uh, couple and we started a group.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.070
And out of that we started another group.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.750
And out of that we started
another group and we started

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.050
one more group before we moved.

00:09:44.745 --> 00:09:45.855
It's so cool.

00:09:45.855 --> 00:09:49.485
Those communities, I begin to think
about that we were a part of, Not

00:09:49.485 --> 00:09:53.415
only were me and Britney so impacted
and I am the person I am today, but

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.345
I begin to realize the people that
I was able to impact and meet like

00:09:57.345 --> 00:10:00.855
those stories will be with me forever
because those communities change me.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.785
So whenever I look at this, and I
really wanna challenge those of you

00:10:04.785 --> 00:10:07.935
that are here tho, those of you who
end up seeing this video when I send it

00:10:07.935 --> 00:10:13.635
to you, cuz I believe the strength of
inspiring hope going forward will be.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.840
The devotion that we put in living
in community together outside of

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.130
Sunday mornings, doing life together,
encouraging one another, believing in

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.290
one another, supporting one another.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.020
That is where the strength will
happen, and we're gonna see

00:10:28.025 --> 00:10:29.430
that today in today's text.

00:10:30.195 --> 00:10:33.795
We're gonna see how they model what
living in community looks like.

00:10:33.795 --> 00:10:37.665
So we're gonna jump into this again, and
this starts in verse 37 and all the way

00:10:37.665 --> 00:10:42.135
down to 47 in Acts chapter two, and I'll
kind of catch you up a little bit here.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:47.475
What what's happened is, is um, Peter
and the Apostles had waited, you

00:10:47.475 --> 00:10:48.645
know, for the Holy Spirit to come.

00:10:48.645 --> 00:10:51.975
The Holy Spirit came and they went out
and they began to preach the gospel.

00:10:52.725 --> 00:10:54.314
All these people came to faith in Christ.

00:10:54.314 --> 00:10:57.615
Over 3000 were coming to faith into
Christ, and this is the the point in

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:58.905
which they're coming to faith in Christ.

00:10:58.905 --> 00:11:02.895
They'd shared the gospel and it picks
up in verse 37, it says, When they heard

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:08.505
this, They were pierced to the heart
and said to Peter and the rest of the

00:11:08.505 --> 00:11:11.115
Apostles Brothers, what should we do?

00:11:11.685 --> 00:11:16.395
And Peter replied, Repent and be baptized,
each one of you and the name of Jesus

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.195
Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.

00:11:18.615 --> 00:11:23.145
And you will receive the gift of the uh,
of the Holy Spirit for the promise is for

00:11:23.145 --> 00:11:28.245
you and your children and for all those
who are far off, as many as the Lord are.

00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:33.459
Will call, and with many other words, he
testified strongly and urged them, saying,

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.010
Be saved from this corrupt generation.

00:11:36.339 --> 00:11:40.600
So that who accepted this message
were baptized, and that day, about

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.310
3000 people were added to them.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.150
And then it says that they
devoted themselves to the apostles

00:11:46.155 --> 00:11:50.290
teaching, to the fellowship, to the
breaking of bread and to prayer.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.569
Everyone was filled with all and
many wonders and signs were being

00:11:54.569 --> 00:11:56.430
performed through the apostles.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.060
Now, all the believers were together
and held all things in common.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.170
They sold their possessions and
property and distributed proceeds

00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:07.140
to the to all as any had need.

00:12:07.709 --> 00:12:10.949
Every day, they devoted themselves
to meeting together in the temple

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.430
and breaking bread from house to
house that ate their food with

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.540
joyful and sincere hearts, praising
God and enjoying the favor of all.

00:12:19.455 --> 00:12:23.985
Every day the Lord added to their
number, those who are being save.

00:12:24.195 --> 00:12:25.485
Let's take a moment to pray.

00:12:26.055 --> 00:12:28.725
Lord Jesus, we just pray, Lord
that our hearts are open today.

00:12:28.905 --> 00:12:30.135
My Lord mind included.

00:12:30.585 --> 00:12:35.385
Um, that we see the value, Lord, we see
the opportunity we have in community.

00:12:35.385 --> 00:12:38.565
We see Lord, that it is a next
step that every one of us.

00:12:39.165 --> 00:12:42.225
Is being invited in to take and
to make priority in our life

00:12:42.225 --> 00:12:45.765
because it is valuable, not only
for us, but for those around us.

00:12:46.095 --> 00:12:49.605
Lord, I pray that you continue to
walk with us as a church as we begin

00:12:49.605 --> 00:12:51.345
to continue to take next steps.

00:12:51.345 --> 00:12:56.025
Lord and I pray that we continue
to see life change, um, and Lord,

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:58.605
that we will continue to give you
praise because of that life change.

00:12:59.025 --> 00:13:00.705
And so, Lori, just pray
this in your Heaven name.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:07.680
So we see here as we, we kind
of almost even, uh, look at the,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.910
the first couple of verses there.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:15.360
37 through, uh, 41, we see obviously
them responding to the gospel.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.200
These 3000 people respond to the gospel
and I begin to look at, that's the

00:13:19.205 --> 00:13:21.210
moment they begin to take next steps.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.870
These people heard the
gospel and they repented.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.710
They were baptized and they received
the spirit of God inside of.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.570
But they didn't stop there, right?

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:31.650
Those were next steps.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.760
They were pined of their sins.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.830
They were baptized, they
received the spirit of God.

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.560
They live inside them,
and they didn't stop.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.520
They, they continued to to take
next steps by living in community.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.800
So what does community look like?

00:13:43.805 --> 00:13:47.280
And I believe this text clearly tells us
what community looks like, is devotion.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:53.760
He says this in verse 42 and 46,
that they devoted themselves to these

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.300
things, and I even wouldn't look at
another word other than devotion,

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.370
is they dedicated themselves.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.980
They committed themselves to these things.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.370
And if you would even see here,
most of the time it was daily.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.199
It wasn't a one time thing.

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:10.079
It wasn't a occasional,
it was a daily act.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.650
And so whenever I started looking at
this, I started saying, Okay, the first

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.825
step of obedience outside of salvation
and baptism, Was to live in community.

00:14:19.455 --> 00:14:20.445
If you wanna know why.

00:14:20.445 --> 00:14:23.205
As a church, we've set that
up as a strategy to follow

00:14:23.205 --> 00:14:24.285
Jesus and live in community.

00:14:24.285 --> 00:14:27.105
We believe that's the
way the church started.

00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:32.775
It was a good way to start and we should
continue that way as a church is to

00:14:33.015 --> 00:14:35.175
to prioritize community after faith.

00:14:35.355 --> 00:14:37.214
And so that's why we talk
about living in community.

00:14:37.214 --> 00:14:42.495
So let's see what they devoted themselves
to and how that applies to us as well.

00:14:42.495 --> 00:14:45.584
So these new followers of Jesus
devoted and dedicated themselves

00:14:45.589 --> 00:14:46.724
to the apostles teaching.

00:14:46.995 --> 00:14:49.365
Well, just so you know,
there's no more apostles other

00:14:49.365 --> 00:14:50.714
than the word of God, right?

00:14:50.714 --> 00:14:52.245
So they're devoted to that.

00:14:52.454 --> 00:14:53.564
They're devoted to what?

00:14:53.564 --> 00:14:54.314
I would even say this.

00:14:54.405 --> 00:14:55.094
Why is.

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:58.650
because they were new in their faith.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.579
They knew, Hey, we don't really fully
understand all this, so we're gonna

00:15:02.579 --> 00:15:04.530
devote ourselves to wise teaching.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.079
And so that's really what we see
here when they devoted themselves

00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:08.040
to the apostles teaching.

00:15:08.459 --> 00:15:11.160
Here's the part I love, I've, I've
read it in different versions, but

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.469
in the csb, here's what it says.

00:15:13.469 --> 00:15:15.569
It says they devoted themselves
to the apostles teaching.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.329
And two, the fellowship.

00:15:18.719 --> 00:15:22.650
And I stopped because the initially,
when I look at this, this is what I.

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:26.579
They devote themselves to fellowship,
and I believe that's a part of it, right?

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.819
Fellowship, which means is the,
the hanging out and the part

00:15:29.819 --> 00:15:32.610
of the breaking of bread and,
and doing life together, right?

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.530
That's the first part
that most of us think of.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.160
But this is the part that I really
want us to think through, and I want

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.089
us to be challenged to think they
devoted themselves to the fellowship.

00:15:42.689 --> 00:15:46.410
Well, the fellowship means they
were dedicated themselves to one.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.314
. Right.

00:15:48.555 --> 00:15:52.064
And I think that's a different
picture, guys, because to, to

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.325
dedicate myself to just attending a
community group or an inspire group

00:15:56.325 --> 00:15:58.155
and hanging out is a good thing.

00:15:58.155 --> 00:15:59.715
And I believe that's the
part that they're saying they

00:15:59.715 --> 00:16:01.215
dedicated themselves to that too.

00:16:01.814 --> 00:16:06.045
But when they dedicated to themselves to
one another, that was like a marriage,

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:12.225
that was like a, a union that God
designed the body to put together.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.290
So I see this as such an important part.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.780
They dedicated themselves to one another.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.230
And I remember making this
statement in Brockington.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.949
You may remember this.

00:16:22.955 --> 00:16:25.170
I remember the group that we
had with Nathan and Christine.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.420
I would make this statement
pretty consistently when I get

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.710
the opportunity to teach in there.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:35.010
What if your attendance in this community
group, this small group, wasn't just here

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.810
to change your life but somebody else's?

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.360
By you being here, you're
encouraging somebody else.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.199
And for me, most of the.

00:16:41.055 --> 00:16:44.475
Brock and Jenna's presence encouraged
me because they cared enough to come.

00:16:44.475 --> 00:16:46.485
They saw it as valuable, right?

00:16:46.485 --> 00:16:51.825
So like when we are dedicated to
each other in fellowship, like

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:56.915
there's a relationship there guys
that is strong, that is valuable,

00:16:56.955 --> 00:16:59.535
that God has designed us for.

00:16:59.825 --> 00:17:04.605
And so I love that picture that we're
dedicated to one another because what

00:17:04.605 --> 00:17:09.285
if your involvement in Inspire group
is what changes someone else's lives?

00:17:09.915 --> 00:17:11.925
Here's, let me just, let
me challenge you with this.

00:17:12.135 --> 00:17:16.784
Your dedication to those things
will change someone's else's life.

00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:17.954
Yours, right?

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:21.794
Because you're there, but there's someone
there that needs your encouragement,

00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:24.675
your dedication to them to care.

00:17:25.395 --> 00:17:28.635
And I, my, my challenge is, and we're
gonna continue to talk about this with

00:17:28.635 --> 00:17:32.205
Inspire groups and as those who lead out
new Inspire groups, is that we create

00:17:32.205 --> 00:17:36.875
communities That's just not the leader's
responsibility to be dedicated to the.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:41.580
And like checking in on him and investing,
but it's the group's responsibility

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.620
to, to take care of one another.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.970
And even those, what?

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.570
I'll just even say this, so you know
what, If my schedule doesn't match

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.690
up with an Inspire group, if your
schedule doesn't match up with an

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.570
Inspire group, you're still going
to be a part of an inspire group.

00:17:54.575 --> 00:17:58.230
You may not get to 10 attend,
but those people will have

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.100
you as part of their group.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.720
They will connect themselves.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.230
They will dedicate themselves to
you as a group to invest in you.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.400
Pray for you, encourage.

00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:08.205
Because that's the church we wanna be.

00:18:08.265 --> 00:18:11.505
We wanna be just like the
church that started here.

00:18:12.255 --> 00:18:15.375
So we, as they continue on, it says that
they were devoted to breaking bread.

00:18:15.405 --> 00:18:19.155
Everybody loves eating food,
so why wouldn't you dedicate

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.445
yourself to that while you meet?

00:18:20.565 --> 00:18:21.405
We love food.

00:18:21.615 --> 00:18:22.515
That's why we eat.

00:18:22.755 --> 00:18:26.925
But I would even say this, some of
the best conversations, some of the

00:18:26.925 --> 00:18:29.745
most funny things happen over a mill.

00:18:30.045 --> 00:18:30.855
I like laughing.

00:18:30.855 --> 00:18:32.025
I, I like hanging.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.330
I would even say this, a lot of the mills
I've even had since we've been here at

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.510
Inspiring Hope, have been some of the
coolest meals because a lot of times those

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:44.610
mills were part of me inviting people to
come be a part of inspiring Hope, right?

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.370
Like, we're gonna hang out and we're
gonna talk about some cool things.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.430
So I love, that's why we have
lunch with, you know, lunch, right?

00:18:50.435 --> 00:18:51.330
When we have the next steps.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:51.780
Lunch.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.610
It's because it's just
cool to hang out with food.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.640
So I think we're just being godly
when we break bread together.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:57.090
Okay.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.590
Then most even believe this,
that at the end of those mills

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.920
that they would celebrate a
communion, um, with that as well.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.880
And so it even talks to the idea
behind having communion together.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.640
Um, and then it says this,
he talks about that they were

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.710
dedicated themselves to prayer.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.930
So prayer for one another.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.330
And this is truly a place to be vulnerable
and to share what's going on in our lives.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.930
And I would even say this, this is
something that I want to continue to teach

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.730
myself and I wanna continue to teach our.

00:19:28.035 --> 00:19:32.025
We undervalue the power and
the importance of prayer.

00:19:32.595 --> 00:19:36.345
It was an essential part in these
new believers' lives, right?

00:19:36.345 --> 00:19:39.675
To teaching, to fellowship, to
breaking a bread into prayer.

00:19:39.675 --> 00:19:44.085
It was a key part, and I think
many times this is just being me.

00:19:44.745 --> 00:19:47.715
I don't mention prayer request because
I feel embarrassed by some of the

00:19:47.715 --> 00:19:52.365
things I want you to pray for me about,
or I don't even mention our prayer

00:19:52.365 --> 00:19:54.925
request because I'm not trusting God.

00:19:55.815 --> 00:19:57.705
Enough in the areas to even have one.

00:19:57.794 --> 00:19:58.485
I don't have one.

00:19:58.935 --> 00:20:00.705
I'm not prayer request, cuz
I've got it all figured out.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:01.274
I'm good.

00:20:01.815 --> 00:20:05.355
So it's like, to me, I think that's
part of this, as we look at living in

00:20:05.355 --> 00:20:10.155
community together, we need to dedicate
ourselves to prayer and the more idea

00:20:10.159 --> 00:20:15.105
behind the purpose of prayer, to be more
like God, to be able to be vulnerable

00:20:15.105 --> 00:20:16.635
with one another and to encourage one.

00:20:17.595 --> 00:20:21.585
So we see that just in those, that
first, first of verse 42 here.

00:20:21.945 --> 00:20:24.284
But let's just continue on cuz it
goes down and I'm, I'm gonna kind

00:20:24.284 --> 00:20:26.145
of split this up into section of 46.

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:29.235
And he says, And every day
they devoted themselves, right?

00:20:29.235 --> 00:20:33.524
So they continue to devote themselves
and dedicate themselves to doing what

00:20:33.855 --> 00:20:37.304
it says that they devoted themselves
to meeting together in the temple.

00:20:38.235 --> 00:20:43.274
So this is just, again, if you think about
the temple, pre Jesus, the temple was

00:20:43.274 --> 00:20:45.705
the place where the presence of God was.

00:20:47.445 --> 00:20:49.365
I started thinking, Well, they
don't need to go to the temple

00:20:49.365 --> 00:20:51.915
anymore because the presence of
God doesn't hang out there anymore.

00:20:52.575 --> 00:20:54.825
But then I kind of laughed
and corrected myself.

00:20:56.145 --> 00:21:00.135
When we come to the temple, a
place of gathering, the presence of

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:01.425
God is there because we're there.

00:21:02.445 --> 00:21:06.315
So why would we, you know, look
at this and go, Well, you know,

00:21:06.345 --> 00:21:09.195
they don't need the temple, that
Christ lives inside of them.

00:21:09.705 --> 00:21:12.085
They're saying we needed a big
enough place to hang out with each.

00:21:12.885 --> 00:21:14.445
So they needed the big community.

00:21:14.445 --> 00:21:17.055
That's why you hear us, like
we have Sunday mornings, Why

00:21:17.055 --> 00:21:17.775
do we have Sunday mornings?

00:21:17.775 --> 00:21:18.525
And I know you're looking at 'em.

00:21:18.615 --> 00:21:19.875
This isn't much of a big community.

00:21:19.995 --> 00:21:22.065
It's a bigger community than
what you would normally see

00:21:22.065 --> 00:21:22.965
in an inspire group, right?

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.165
When we have everybody here.

00:21:24.495 --> 00:21:27.105
So that bigger community is to
come together, to meet together and

00:21:27.105 --> 00:21:31.425
see the whole church, to encourage
the whole church to, to gather and

00:21:31.425 --> 00:21:33.975
learn in God's word into praise.

00:21:33.975 --> 00:21:34.305
Right?

00:21:34.305 --> 00:21:37.395
So they were dedicated to
that same thing as we are as.

00:21:38.985 --> 00:21:41.715
Then they were also dedicated
to meeting house, to house.

00:21:41.715 --> 00:21:43.845
This is where we talk
about community, right?

00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:46.335
This is the community that we're
saying, doing life together.

00:21:46.635 --> 00:21:49.485
When you meet in somebody's home, I
look at it at two different places.

00:21:49.485 --> 00:21:52.635
I, I've had groups at the church
and I've had groups in my home.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.100
Groups at the church are great,
but I don't feel like that there

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.300
is comfortable and as relaxed
and as inviting as a home is.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.250
Home is where family comes.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.300
I would say this, this is a challenge
that, that I have been reminded

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.110
of even recently, that when we
invite people under a home, we've

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.820
given them refrigerator rights.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.450
You know what a refrigerator rights are
that they can walk in, they can open your

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.040
refrigerator and take anything out of it,
and you're not gonna go, What are you?

00:22:19.105 --> 00:22:19.200
, Right?

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.850
It's that it's that moment where they're
family that you have, as we go back

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:32.520
to, as you have dedicated yourself to
one another, they're as, as have as

00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:34.080
much access as you do to your home.

00:22:34.875 --> 00:22:39.705
That's the type of life that these
people, after they had just, this is

00:22:39.705 --> 00:22:40.965
the beginning of the church y'all.

00:22:40.965 --> 00:22:45.044
This is whenever the spirit of God began
to, in dwell on people and people begin to

00:22:45.044 --> 00:22:50.054
get to saved they dead educated themselves
to living in community together.

00:22:50.955 --> 00:22:53.504
That's what God has called us to do.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.010
That's why we need to continue to
find ways to do that as a church

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.870
and to follow after these examples.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:01.950
And this is the cool part.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.260
I don't have to go out and recreate this.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:05.760
It's right here.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.429
The, the apostles are
speaking to me right now.

00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:11.730
They're speaking to you right
now to tell us how to do life,

00:23:11.939 --> 00:23:15.720
how to live as followers of
Jesus, not because we have to.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.740
This is the cool part, is because
they devoted them, devoted,

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.840
devoted themselves to these things.

00:23:23.145 --> 00:23:26.925
There was a natural
outflow of this, right?

00:23:26.925 --> 00:23:28.305
Let me, let me, let me talk about this.

00:23:28.485 --> 00:23:31.455
The result of dedicating themselves
to this is these next couple of

00:23:31.455 --> 00:23:35.835
verses, The overflow of living in
community is versus 43 through 45,

00:23:35.835 --> 00:23:37.875
and a couple of things in 46 and 47.

00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:39.285
So 43 says this.

00:23:39.825 --> 00:23:45.285
It says Everyone was filled with
all and many wanders and signs were

00:23:45.285 --> 00:23:47.385
being performed through the Aus.

00:23:48.555 --> 00:23:53.415
I look at this way when we look at verse
43, because they de dedicated and devoted

00:23:53.415 --> 00:23:55.905
themselves to living in community.

00:23:57.045 --> 00:23:59.475
These people were inspired by God, right?

00:23:59.475 --> 00:24:02.925
We, I know he's sitting here saying
that they, the, the apostles were

00:24:02.925 --> 00:24:06.105
doing wanders and signs and at times,
I'll just tell you guys this, when

00:24:06.135 --> 00:24:10.754
you live in community enough, you're
gonna see God move in miraculous ways.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:14.280
These people were inspired by God.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.840
They were so transformed.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.910
They was drawing out of them
what they knew that they were

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.320
created for, which was community.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.890
They got to see God move, right?

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.130
And then we see in verse 44, it
says, Now all the believers were

00:24:26.135 --> 00:24:27.870
together and held things in common.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:34.650
So out of the overflow of devotion to
community, these believers were unified.

00:24:35.595 --> 00:24:39.105
They were, It's says they held all things
in common, and this is where we'd say is

00:24:39.675 --> 00:24:41.025
they didn't see their stuff as their own.

00:24:41.025 --> 00:24:42.855
They had refrigerator rights, Right.

00:24:43.365 --> 00:24:44.775
Their stuff wasn't their own.

00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:45.975
They were theirs.

00:24:46.305 --> 00:24:50.085
Were the communities and the
unified, We talk a lot about this.

00:24:50.325 --> 00:24:52.545
Unified is not uniforming.

00:24:52.545 --> 00:24:54.405
It doesn't mean we all look the same.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:57.765
We all have the same tastes and all
the same emotions and all the same.

00:24:57.765 --> 00:24:58.425
You know what?

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:04.815
But we are unified under what Christ,
the transforming life of Jesus in our

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.455
lives and flowing out of our lives.

00:25:07.755 --> 00:25:08.955
And so I, I go back.

00:25:10.185 --> 00:25:14.265
When we dedicate ourselves to these
things living in community together,

00:25:14.505 --> 00:25:17.115
there's a natural outflow from it.

00:25:17.385 --> 00:25:19.875
And I know you guys probably get
tired of my great examples of

00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:21.375
this, but I love working out.

00:25:21.375 --> 00:25:22.155
I just do that.

00:25:22.155 --> 00:25:22.965
I'm the crazy person.

00:25:22.965 --> 00:25:26.895
I love working out, but the result
of dedicating myself to working out

00:25:27.165 --> 00:25:31.275
produces the outflow of strength and
more endurance, and it's something

00:25:31.365 --> 00:25:32.565
that fuels me and excites me.

00:25:32.565 --> 00:25:33.045
I love it.

00:25:33.045 --> 00:25:33.435
I'm sorry.

00:25:33.435 --> 00:25:38.115
I do, but I do that not because
I just, you know, I love pain.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.669
But it's, it's, I actually
en enjoy those things.

00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:45.990
I dedicate myself to see the result cuz
we, we dedicate ourselves, we devote

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:50.550
ourselves to community, not just for
our benefit, but for the benefit of

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:54.600
the kingdom of God, for the benefit
to see other people experience the

00:25:54.605 --> 00:25:56.669
transforming hope that you've experienced.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.620
So when we come back to this, every
one of us has an excuse why we

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.990
don't wanna live in community or why
we struggle to live in community.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.480
And it may be just so you know, I get it.

00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:09.000
It may be because your
schedule's a lot like mine.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.110
I don't really know much of an evening
right now that I have free, but I started

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:17.070
asking myself this question, but why
would I wanna prioritize community?

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.139
Because it is valuable not only for
me and for other people in that.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.110
And so we're gonna get to more
Is community only inspire groups?

00:26:25.115 --> 00:26:26.490
No, it's not.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.690
We're gonna, we're gonna
continue with that.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:31.379
There's more to it, but let's just
continue on with, with this here.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:34.679
Um, in verse 45, right?

00:26:34.679 --> 00:26:36.629
Those 44 or 43 and 44.

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.320
So in 45 it says this, it says
they sold their possessions and

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.419
property and distributed, um, the
proceeds to all who had need, right?

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:50.429
And so we look at this as is,
as they function together as

00:26:50.429 --> 00:26:55.740
one, they were unified, They saw
each other's needs as their own.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.780
And this is the cool part that I've seen.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.409
Inspiring hope I, I've seen this
actually fleshed out in our church.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:08.760
It excites me that we see our community
of believers and as those who are new in

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:13.440
our church, as part of our family, as part
of our responsibility to take care of not

00:27:13.445 --> 00:27:19.410
only from a selling property right to to
provide a need, but even meeting needs as

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:25.560
mills meeting needs as coming and helping
move to doing all kinds of things like.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.830
They did that same thing, right?

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:31.580
They did whatever they could, their time,
their talents, and their treasures, and

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.890
they gave that to those who had need.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.210
And I just challenge you.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.810
That's why we also give as a church,
because as we give as a church, we don't

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:42.710
only invest in each other, we invest in
our community and meet those same needs.

00:27:44.145 --> 00:27:48.705
Then we look at the first part of 46,
uh, or excuse the second part of 46, cuz

00:27:48.705 --> 00:27:50.175
we kind of covered the first part of 46.

00:27:50.175 --> 00:27:52.545
But it says this, every day they
devoted themselves to the meeting

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:55.665
together in the temple and breaking
up bread from house to house.

00:27:55.875 --> 00:28:00.975
And the result of those dedications,
those devotions, was they ate their

00:28:00.975 --> 00:28:03.945
food with joyful and sincere hearts.

00:28:04.185 --> 00:28:05.625
Joyful and sincere hearts.

00:28:05.774 --> 00:28:06.975
Guys, I'll just tell you this.

00:28:07.335 --> 00:28:14.040
When you spend time in community,
The overflow from that is joyful

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:18.030
hearts and, and it's just in the
simple things of eating food.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:19.620
I mean, I like food, y'all.

00:28:19.625 --> 00:28:23.220
I do, but not am I always
just joyful about it.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:26.310
They were joyful about it because
they understood that everything

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.600
they have is a blessing from God.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.649
They understood everything that they have
is a blessing from God, so they could

00:28:31.649 --> 00:28:36.570
see joy even if, and, and many of these
people aren't rich people that just.

00:28:37.095 --> 00:28:37.845
Food all the time.

00:28:38.055 --> 00:28:40.605
But these people, most of them were
joyful because we just saw the verses

00:28:40.605 --> 00:28:45.465
before their needs were being met,
like they've never been met before.

00:28:45.735 --> 00:28:46.965
They begin to praise God.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.225
We see this in verse 47.

00:28:48.225 --> 00:28:51.735
The result of living a community
is praising God and enjoying

00:28:51.735 --> 00:28:53.115
the favor of all people.

00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:56.415
So God receive praise.

00:28:57.555 --> 00:29:00.165
For people living in community
because he was working in and

00:29:00.165 --> 00:29:01.395
through them, and I love this.

00:29:01.395 --> 00:29:03.435
He says they enjoyed
favor from all people.

00:29:03.795 --> 00:29:06.285
Man, I don't think I'm living
in enough community at times.

00:29:06.285 --> 00:29:09.375
Whenever I think I'm wondering, I'm
probably not receiving favor from all

00:29:09.375 --> 00:29:14.535
people, but what I would say in this,
people begin to see God working in that

00:29:14.535 --> 00:29:17.925
community and they were interested.

00:29:18.585 --> 00:29:21.105
They, they were receiving favor
because typically what you would

00:29:21.105 --> 00:29:25.335
even see in the Old Testament is even
people who didn't believe in God.

00:29:25.935 --> 00:29:30.105
Would know that God's hands
was on a people and and they

00:29:30.105 --> 00:29:31.665
would be envious of them.

00:29:31.665 --> 00:29:34.514
They would, they would be in
favor with them because they

00:29:34.514 --> 00:29:35.955
didn't wanna mess anything up.

00:29:36.285 --> 00:29:38.985
Well, we see the same thing as God
was working through these people.

00:29:39.135 --> 00:29:40.754
They had favor with all kinds of people.

00:29:40.754 --> 00:29:43.425
And I would even say this guys, as
we continue to live in community

00:29:43.455 --> 00:29:46.695
with one another, as we continue
to serve our community, which we'll

00:29:46.695 --> 00:29:51.645
talk about next week, we have already
seen favor in our city because of.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.620
And we look at this and
we see what does God do?

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.080
God works through living in community.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.800
And I would say this, how many of y'all
like to hang out with people, right?

00:30:01.805 --> 00:30:03.510
Like we, we, we enjoy it.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:04.290
We do.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:08.010
But at times, I know this just
take inspire group, but times,

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.590
whenever we were doing inspir
group, I felt like it was a chore.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.240
We know why.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.250
Cuz it didn't see the value in it.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:19.080
I only saw the difficulty
of creating the environment.

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.270
I missed the joy in it.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:24.090
And so I started looking and pouring
over this, and I started reflecting

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.800
on all the groups I've been a part of.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.080
Guys, this is the craziest thing.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:34.080
Our church started as a community
at home and Riley on Zoom and

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.280
Brock and Jenna just moved here.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:39.240
That was how it started, and somehow
a couple more people showed up and

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.730
a couple more people showed up,
and a couple more people showed up.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:47.010
And we lived in community and we laughed
and we ate and we hung out, and we prayed

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.290
and we devoted ourselves to one another.

00:30:50.895 --> 00:30:52.605
Do you know that hasn't changed?

00:30:53.235 --> 00:30:55.545
That commitment as a
church hasn't changed yet.

00:30:55.695 --> 00:30:59.805
We have now more groups and we
have now the, the temple meeting

00:31:00.285 --> 00:31:01.845
that that shouldn't change.

00:31:01.995 --> 00:31:05.625
And those relationships though,
maybe in different groups now,

00:31:05.625 --> 00:31:07.335
cuz y'all know this, right?

00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:13.245
The hardest part of starting
multiple groups is saying bye to

00:31:13.245 --> 00:31:16.875
the other group that you spent all
this time with, and remembering

00:31:16.995 --> 00:31:17.955
that that group's still gonna be.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:22.500
In the big time and occasional
times together, but that group needs

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.210
to continue to reach new people.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:27.480
While this new group's reached into new
people, I'm just telling you it was the

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.570
hardest thing to do for me and Brittney
when we helped start four different

00:31:30.575 --> 00:31:34.380
groups, we left, well three because the
last group we, I guess we technically left

00:31:34.385 --> 00:31:38.310
two, but it was difficult to lead those
groups because we loved those people.

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.580
But you know what motivated
us to go start new groups?

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.490
You wanna know, know what motivated Brock
and Jenna to go start a crazy group with

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:46.950
us and then move across the world with us.

00:31:47.864 --> 00:31:52.995
Because they saw the people that they
would go impact the people that we

00:31:52.995 --> 00:31:57.854
would go impact as a greater burden
than the burden of leaving friends

00:31:58.754 --> 00:32:00.314
burden, of leading those relationships.

00:32:01.215 --> 00:32:05.054
All of us, if they weren't
good friendships, you probably

00:32:05.054 --> 00:32:05.955
weren't in a good group.

00:32:06.524 --> 00:32:07.514
So it's gonna hurt.

00:32:07.794 --> 00:32:11.475
But what I would say with this, and I'm
just, I'm wanting us to come back to

00:32:11.475 --> 00:32:14.564
this idea of, and we're getting ready
to get to the, the fruit of community.

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:21.420
Is that as we live in community,
we will have new communities start

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:26.940
where we aren't as close, but those
communities can become the communities

00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:30.900
that we started with as a church
when we started in our home, If we'll

00:32:30.905 --> 00:32:32.220
dedicate and devote ourselves to them.

00:32:33.345 --> 00:32:37.485
At times it's difficult, but in the
difficult work, some of the greatest

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.315
results, what are those great results?

00:32:39.315 --> 00:32:43.875
We see this in the last part of 47,
The Fruit of Living in Community,

00:32:43.905 --> 00:32:45.165
The Fruit of Living in Community.

00:32:45.165 --> 00:32:47.925
It says this on the last part of verse 47.

00:32:48.345 --> 00:32:51.825
It says, Every day the
Lord added to their number.

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:53.115
Those who are being.

00:32:54.879 --> 00:32:57.990
I, I want you to see this as a church.

00:32:58.409 --> 00:33:02.610
I, I've heard these statements from other
people and I, I warrant them because I,

00:33:02.615 --> 00:33:04.139
I understand the burden that they fill.

00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:06.090
But I love our little community.

00:33:06.439 --> 00:33:07.919
I, I love our little group of church.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.460
If we add any more people, we'll
lose touch with one another.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:16.949
And my challenge is, don't forget.

00:33:17.865 --> 00:33:21.495
That this community reached you and, and
the value that you find in this community,

00:33:21.585 --> 00:33:26.265
and that you see that there, there are
other people, there are other people out

00:33:26.265 --> 00:33:32.535
there wanting that community, wanting
people who will meet their needs, people

00:33:32.535 --> 00:33:35.445
who will show them the love of Christ,
people who will prey with them, People

00:33:35.625 --> 00:33:38.625
who will commit themselves to one another.

00:33:39.255 --> 00:33:40.005
They're waiting on.

00:33:41.085 --> 00:33:45.165
To go live in community with one
another and to go start new communities

00:33:45.315 --> 00:33:47.025
so that we can see the fruit.

00:33:47.264 --> 00:33:51.585
More people come to experience that
same experience that you've experienced.

00:33:52.065 --> 00:33:56.775
Right, Because these believers lived in
community and did life with one another.

00:33:56.835 --> 00:33:58.995
The lives of those around
them were being changed.

00:34:01.215 --> 00:34:05.835
They were, they were being a picture
to the lost and hurting world around.

00:34:07.215 --> 00:34:11.295
This is, I'll just tell you, I, I,
if I could define inspiring hope,

00:34:11.355 --> 00:34:18.405
I wanna define us as a community
that lives together just like this.

00:34:18.645 --> 00:34:22.034
Guys, if we can't dedicate to
this, I don't know if I wanna

00:34:22.034 --> 00:34:23.355
be dedicated to anything else.

00:34:23.925 --> 00:34:24.525
I really don't.

00:34:24.525 --> 00:34:26.655
And that's really the burden that
God's been putting on my heart.

00:34:26.804 --> 00:34:30.554
If we don't get back to the genuineness
of living in community together and

00:34:30.554 --> 00:34:33.645
starting more communities to invite
people into, we're gonna miss the.

00:34:34.335 --> 00:34:36.315
Of why God's called us
to plant this church.

00:34:37.304 --> 00:34:38.355
This community needs it.

00:34:38.355 --> 00:34:39.284
Your neighbors need it.

00:34:39.284 --> 00:34:40.335
Your family needs it.

00:34:40.995 --> 00:34:41.625
We need it.

00:34:43.365 --> 00:34:44.235
What is it gonna take?

00:34:44.775 --> 00:34:51.645
Dedicating it and devoting ourselves to
these things, not out of a burden, but

00:34:51.645 --> 00:34:55.185
out of excitement, out of an opportunity.

00:34:56.655 --> 00:35:00.705
So the greatest way to experience growth
in your personal walk and God's kingdom

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.025
is to live in community with one.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.190
So I want to circle back to this.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:08.310
Is there only one way to live in
community together in inspire groups?

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:10.470
Cuz you know, it says that in the
Bible it's only in inspire groups.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.400
No.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.600
Yes, there's discipleship relationships
and there's work relationships and

00:35:15.605 --> 00:35:16.860
there's neighbor relationships.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.740
But I wanna, I wanna point
out one specific thing here

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:21.210
that he does talk about.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.770
He is talking about believers
gathering together in communities.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.720
So yes, we should have.

00:35:28.305 --> 00:35:31.575
Some groups where we have a lot of lost
people involved, or we're hanging out

00:35:31.575 --> 00:35:32.715
with neighbors and doing those things.

00:35:32.715 --> 00:35:34.635
And that's part of community living that.

00:35:34.815 --> 00:35:38.385
But this community was specifically for
the believers to build one another up.

00:35:38.385 --> 00:35:40.245
We go back to encourage one another up.

00:35:40.725 --> 00:35:43.095
And yes, there was people being
added to them daily because they

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.915
were seeing it and they were
invited into it and experiencing it.

00:35:46.665 --> 00:35:50.745
So inspire groups is the way that we see
as a way to commit to fleshing that out.

00:35:50.745 --> 00:35:54.375
And so I, I wanna say this, if
you don't plan for something,

00:35:54.975 --> 00:35:56.085
we all have great intentions.

00:35:56.085 --> 00:35:57.225
Y'all have great intentions of eating.

00:35:58.065 --> 00:36:01.335
Until you look in your fridge and you
see cheesecake rather than, you know,

00:36:01.335 --> 00:36:03.705
something healthy and you eat cheesecake.

00:36:04.965 --> 00:36:08.085
I, I, my guess I'm just
gonna throw a guess out here.

00:36:08.115 --> 00:36:11.775
Everybody in this room probably desires
to live in community with one another.

00:36:11.955 --> 00:36:14.355
Maybe you're already doing it, but
you desire and you desire to see

00:36:14.355 --> 00:36:15.435
other people live in community.

00:36:16.515 --> 00:36:19.095
But what's the difference between
leaving out here and being a part

00:36:19.095 --> 00:36:22.335
of that community and helping
others be involved in it or not?

00:36:23.205 --> 00:36:26.655
It's actually putting something
down to hold you accountable to.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.930
If you'll commit to being a
part of an inspire group once

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.180
a week, it's there every week.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.680
It's a group of people that are expecting
you, that are gonna hold you accountable,

00:36:37.685 --> 00:36:40.350
that's gonna help you grow in your
faith and to be a part of this thing.

00:36:40.355 --> 00:36:42.570
And, and yes, I want you
to do more than that.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:46.320
I want you to hang out with people at your
work and, and live in community with them.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.180
And I want you to hang out with
your neighbors and those things.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.970
And for me, right now, I'm gonna hang
out with people on the football field.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.760
I don't know what I'm doing, but
I can hang out with those people

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.930
cuz they're crazier than I am.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.510
But I'm trying to figure out
how to do community there too.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.290
But I believe God's called us to
a community of believers as well.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:04.200
That's why we have that, that's
why we're launching these groups

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.020
again, that's why we're wanting
to prioritize that as a church.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.670
So we have to make it a consistent thing.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:12.900
So I'm, I'm gonna finish up this way.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.190
I, I'm gonna be done, I promise.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:18.780
So, as we seek God's word to
see how we should live our lives

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.250
after giving your lives to Jesus.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:26.160
We see that living in community is the
next logical step, the next logical step

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.510
for them and for us not to begrudgingly
do it, because that's what we have to do.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:34.080
Because I'm just telling you, if
you have that heart, oh, just tell

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.630
me and I'm gonna pray for you and
we're gonna talk about not having the

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.280
heart of this is what I have to do.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:44.070
No, we saw today the benefits
of being a part of c.

00:37:45.089 --> 00:37:48.089
That's why we are a part of
community, because we see that

00:37:48.089 --> 00:37:50.640
as we devote ourselves, there's
this fruit that comes out of it.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.370
And there's these things that we
get to experience these, these

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:56.220
things that we would've never
experienced apart from that community.

00:37:56.430 --> 00:38:02.250
I hope today you are being drawn
in and, and wanna be a part of

00:38:02.254 --> 00:38:03.720
community to experience that.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.750
So during our time of invitation, this
is one I wanna challenge you with.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.100
What's stopping you
from being a part of c?

00:38:09.645 --> 00:38:11.505
So, so I wanna speak to everybody.

00:38:11.565 --> 00:38:13.575
Hey, well, when we start back up
groups, I'll be there every week.

00:38:13.575 --> 00:38:14.235
Okay, great.

00:38:14.235 --> 00:38:17.175
What's stopping you from being
committed to that community?

00:38:17.175 --> 00:38:17.715
Even more.

00:38:18.645 --> 00:38:22.275
Because we can attend community
for me, or we can invest in the

00:38:22.275 --> 00:38:23.205
community that we're a part of.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.305
And that's the part I wanna
continue to challenge everybody.

00:38:25.395 --> 00:38:27.555
Everybody has a next step.

00:38:27.945 --> 00:38:30.735
It may not all look the same,
but everybody has an next step.

00:38:30.735 --> 00:38:35.385
For some of you, what's stopping you
from being a part of community right?

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:38.035
To, to experience this overflow of c.

00:38:38.985 --> 00:38:42.105
Is it because there isn't a night
that we do an inspire group together,

00:38:42.105 --> 00:38:44.235
Is it because you don't have a
group of people to do life with?

00:38:44.505 --> 00:38:48.075
And if that's true, that's why you
have a card there to fill out and say,

00:38:48.075 --> 00:38:49.605
Hey, there's even notes down there.

00:38:49.605 --> 00:38:51.765
You can write down, Hey, none of
these nights work, None of these

00:38:51.765 --> 00:38:54.885
days work because my life's crazy
busy, but I desire community.

00:38:54.945 --> 00:38:55.695
You know what we'll do?

00:38:56.415 --> 00:38:58.485
We'll reach out and we'll talk about
how can we create community with you.

00:38:58.905 --> 00:39:02.415
If you circle a night that we don't
have an inspired group, what can we do?

00:39:02.415 --> 00:39:04.485
Just like what we talked
about every inspire.

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:07.590
Once we have these things going,
we'll have three inspire groups.

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:11.250
Every one of those groups will have
people attached to them that may

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:13.470
never attend that group because it
doesn't match up with their night.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:14.970
But they're going to minister to you.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:18.180
They're gonna invite you into
community as you have opportunity

00:39:18.185 --> 00:39:19.650
to, and we're gonna create that.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.220
Guys.

00:39:20.225 --> 00:39:24.300
The future of Inspiring Hope is
focusing on living in community.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:29.340
The overflow of that will change your
life, change this church's life and will

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.380
change this community's life, I believe.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:34.620
That's why we are talking about this.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:38.520
This is why I am who I am, because the
communities that I've been a part of have

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:43.410
made me the person I am today because
Jesus worked through those communities and

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:48.120
I can't help but wanna be a part of the
next person that gets to experience the

00:39:48.125 --> 00:39:52.770
community that I've been a part of and be
changed to be a part of another community,

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:53.880
to be a part of another community.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:56.130
So what's stopping you
from being a part of that?

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:57.750
I also challenge you with this.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.520
Maybe you've never even taken the.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.560
Of giving your life to Jesus.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.290
What's stopping you from
giving your life to Jesus?

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.560
Only you know that, and Jesus knows that.

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.790
So during invitation, I challenge you
to ask God what it looks like to take

00:40:11.795 --> 00:40:18.090
a next step to follow Jesus, or a next
step to be in community with one another.

00:40:18.095 --> 00:40:19.560
Please fill out those cards.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.570
Write down where you're interested
in being a part of a group.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.670
But I'll just tell you
this, Don't make an excuse.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.410
Everybody has 'em.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.300
But community is more important
than whatever excuse we can make

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.530
because God wants to work in your
life and the lives of those of

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:41.700
the community you're a part of.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.290
So let's pray.

00:40:43.295 --> 00:40:44.100
Lord Jesus.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:48.030
Lord, we thank you Lord
because you are good.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.100
We thank you because your word is truth.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:56.490
And Lord, as we, as a church look deep
into your word and as we go back to

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.100
really our, our, our roots of, of why we.

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:06.420
We are reminded, Lord, the
number one we are to follow you.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:12.180
We are to lay down everything that is
hindering our, our walk on our life.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.430
And we follow after you Lord.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:19.259
And as we look at your example, your
example was set when you first begin

00:41:19.259 --> 00:41:22.259
your ministry, where you brought
a community in to live life with,

00:41:22.529 --> 00:41:24.540
do life with encouraged to teach.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.549
But then, Lord, whenever.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.120
Left this earth and left the
Holy Spirit to live in our lives.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.830
You set another example of community that
the next logical step after following

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:37.170
you is to do life with one another.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:45.029
To be devoted to these things, to Weis
teaching, to prayer, to the fellowship,

00:41:45.029 --> 00:41:50.160
to one another, to breaking up bread,
to meeting together in the temple,

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:54.750
to meeting together in each other's
homes to experience the outflow.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:59.730
Of those things, Lord, to
see people's needs being met.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.190
Many wanders and signs being done.

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:05.460
More people coming to faith in you.

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:10.260
Praise and worship, Lord, these are
things that we desire to see as a

00:42:10.265 --> 00:42:13.800
church, and I believe every person in
this room desires to experience that.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.100
But Lord, there is something that
may be hindering them from that.

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:18.870
Lord, will you remove it today?

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.650
Lord, I'm asking you right.

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:29.490
Not in my power, Lord, by desire
is that you remove whatever it is

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:32.790
that is hindering anybody in this
room to be a part of community.

00:42:33.029 --> 00:42:35.640
If it's work, Lord, will you remove it?

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:39.960
If, if it's an unwillingness to
be vulnerable because it's just

00:42:39.964 --> 00:42:42.960
a struggle to be part of a small
group, Lord, will you remove it?

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.150
If it's just anxiety, if it's, if
it's busyness, I, Lord, I don't know,

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:49.350
but whatever it is, Lord, will you.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.580
Lord, will you take those
who weren't even here today?

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.280
And Lord, as I get an opportunity
to share this message with them this

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.580
week, and as they begin to contemplate,
Lord, what their next step is, Lord,

00:42:59.585 --> 00:43:01.230
will you remove the barriers there?

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.930
Lord I, I know this.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:10.740
We've done all that we can and it's
nothing compared to all that you can.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:16.050
And so that, Lord, that's why we're
praying, that's why we're using your

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:18.990
word to remind us of who we are.

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.710
Because apart from your word,
apart from you, and apart from

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:24.810
prayer, Lord, we can do nothing.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:32.340
So, Lord, my desire, our desire as
a church is to know you more and to

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:37.500
experience the community that you've
called us, to devote ourselves to Lord,

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:43.500
to give us the passion and desire and the
inspiration, Lord, to go out and to to

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:46.980
share that with other people and to invite
them into the community that we have.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:51.960
Lord, we are praying for
life change in our community.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.360
We're praying for one more person.

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:59.490
One more person has experienced your hope,
Lord, that's the last thing that I wanna

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:03.960
pray today, is that if there is a person
in this room that has not given their

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:07.200
life to you, Lord, may they not leave
today before they give their life to you.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:12.210
Lord, may they repent their sins,
May they confess you as Lord.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:13.980
May they take a next step of.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:18.120
Them and may they begin the journey of
living in community with one another.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:21.930
Lord, if there's a person in this room,
Lord, I pray that they come back and

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:26.130
talk to me after service, Lord, that they
share with me their need to follow you.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.980
Lord, if there's a person in this room
whose relationship with Jesus has been

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.780
hindered, Lord, may you forgive them.

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:36.120
May you restore that relationship and
may you continue to take us Lord from

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:40.590
here as individuals and as a church
to live in community together because

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.720
you have so called us to do that.

00:44:45.299 --> 00:44:46.620
Lord, we thank you for today.

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.870
We thank you for everything
that you'll do in our lives,

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:50.270
and we pray this in your head.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:51.669
Amen.
