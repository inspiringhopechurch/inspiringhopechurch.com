learn more about god's word but um we'll be in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.760
matthew 28 today and i just want to share this&nbsp;
um one of the things that we value as a church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:44.800
is timeless it is truth um one of the things&nbsp;
that i quote all the time it's john 17 17 that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.280
says his word is truth and so because god's word&nbsp;
is truth we have the ability to gain wisdom from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.880
it knowledge to apply to our lives um and so i&nbsp;
just really want to encourage you if you haven't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.000
been spending time in god's word or maybe you've&nbsp;
never opened up god's word before um to do it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.120
to begin to just explore what is in god's word and&nbsp;
today we'll do that as well um so again we'll be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.520
in matthew 28 we'll start in verse one in just&nbsp;
a second but today we're gonna be talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.920
how hope is alive and it was interesting um as&nbsp;
a church um we actually you know probably most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.920
churches around i saw about 20 different churches&nbsp;
promote online that they were having easter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.680
services and one of the things is as we promoted&nbsp;
our church easter service um i had people tagging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.520
my hopes always alive almost like questioning&nbsp;
that i had just made the statement that hope's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.720
only alive today and no other day so just to&nbsp;
be clear hope's alive every day obviously today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.480
we're celebrating that that hope that we have in&nbsp;
jesus is is alive and so um just want to share&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.400
this with you when i begin to think about hope&nbsp;
um hope is basically a failure and expectation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.560
um and a desire for certain things to happen from&nbsp;
a biblical standpoint um our hope is desire um is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.760
really a desire based upon the promises of god so&nbsp;
our hope is in god our hope is in the truth that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.960
god gives us through his word and the promises&nbsp;
that he says he will never leave us or forsake us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.760
i hope that we'll have a life beyond this life&nbsp;
as well and so i just want you to think through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.200
just a few things before we get started um and&nbsp;
again i think we've all have probably lived in in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.560
an interesting world over the last year so let me&nbsp;
let me ask you this question and just to give you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.600
your own self-assessment you can answer you&nbsp;
don't have to answer out loud for this but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.240
um how many of you over the last year had a point&nbsp;
where you felt hopeless maybe there was something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.480
that was out of your control that you thought&nbsp;
you always had controls you feel hopeless anyway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.760
i know i have um what about this is is there some&nbsp;
things or some people in your life that maybe have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.520
let you down specifically in the last six months&nbsp;
maybe even uh when we think about what's let us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.320
down maybe it's just it really could be family but&nbsp;
it really could even be those that we're close to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.320
uh in our work but also i would even say just in&nbsp;
our world right in the control that we thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.320
we had as a as a country when it comes to&nbsp;
sickness when it comes to political issues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.080
we've felt probably hopeless so let me ask&nbsp;
this last question how many of you all know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.840
that there is hope to be found outside&nbsp;
of the things that maybe we have lost

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.480
i hope that you do know that i hope if you don't&nbsp;
know that but by the end today you will know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.440
but hope is alive um and really despite your&nbsp;
circumstances despite what we've all gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.160
through and what we may continue to go through&nbsp;
that doesn't change and here's the reason why i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.880
want to mention this um does the sun stop shining&nbsp;
when it gets dark anybody this is probably it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.400
doesn't it's always shining just maybe not here&nbsp;
just on the other side of the world see that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.920
the hope that we have in jesus that jesus is&nbsp;
always present despite the darkness that maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.480
we have in our lives i'm thankful for the presence&nbsp;
of jesus today and so today i'm going to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.800
reading again matthew 28 verses 1 through 8. and&nbsp;
this is what it says it says after the sabbath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.720
as the first day of the week was dawning mary&nbsp;
magdalene and the other mary went to view the tomb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.320
and there was a violent earthquake because an&nbsp;
angel of the lord had descended from heaven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.720
and approached the tomb he rolled back the&nbsp;
stone and was sustained air was sitting on him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.560
his appearance was like lightning and his clothing&nbsp;
was as white as snow and the guards were so shaken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.200
by fear of him that they became like dead men the&nbsp;
angel told the woman or the women don't be afraid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.160
because i know you are looking for jesus who was&nbsp;
crucified he is not here for he has risen just as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.440
he had said come and see the place where he lay&nbsp;
then go quickly and tell his disciples he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.960
risen from the dead and indeed he's going ahead&nbsp;
and used galilee well you will see him there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.280
listen i have told you so departed quickly from&nbsp;
the tomb with fear and great joy they ran to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.120
his disciples the news let's take some time to&nbsp;
pray lord jesus again we're thankful for today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.600
thankful for the opportunity to open your word&nbsp;
and lord i just pray that your presence is here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.040
um that you meet with each person lord&nbsp;
individually lord i pray that as they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.680
walking through and processing or what you have to&nbsp;
tell them i pray that they individualize the lord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.080
that they are challenged lord to continue to live&nbsp;
their lives out for you and lord if they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.720
know you i pray that they come to know you before&nbsp;
they leave today and so will we just pray this

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:40.400
amen before we jump into this text i want to&nbsp;
catch you up see there's every you ever get in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.440
the middle of a story where somebody's sharing&nbsp;
with somebody else and you're like whoa you got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.840
to back up that was the moment i felt whenever&nbsp;
i began to prepare for today's message was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.080
hey wait where were we how did we even get to this&nbsp;
point where hey he's risen hope's alive right how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.920
do we get to that point so i'm just going to kind&nbsp;
of do a quick summary of really what has happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:06.160
at this point um and if you notice this is this is&nbsp;
a challenge to you you ever hear something so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.760
times you're like yeah i've heard that before&nbsp;
i pray today that you think of the story that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.720
i'm getting ready to share with you from a new&nbsp;
perspective let it be refreshing i believe that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.080
there is power remembering what god has done right&nbsp;
so in the beginning god created everything right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.360
god created everything this world everything that&nbsp;
we see us his greatest creation was you and me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.160
and obviously in the beginning that was out of&nbsp;
need right in the beginning god walked in peace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.480
with man and that was his goal right but what we&nbsp;
all know or if you've been around maybe church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.240
enough that sin came into the world right adam and&nbsp;
eve chose to disobey god and in the midst of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.200
disobedience god can be in the presence of sin&nbsp;
and so what did he do he obviously he kicked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.720
them out of the garden i mean but he didn't leave&nbsp;
him in that condition see that's where the broken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.320
relationship between god and man happened long&nbsp;
time ago but here's the thing we still haven't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.240
solved that right permanently there's&nbsp;
still a broken relationship between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:10.720
god and man except for the son jesus that he&nbsp;
sent to be able to help that broken relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:18.320
and so what did god do god after sending adam&nbsp;
and eve out of the garden he began to run after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.000
everyone he created because he loved them so&nbsp;
much he says i don't want to see this broken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.040
relationship stay this way so he says the only&nbsp;
way for this to be solved is to send my son jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.920
so this is where we get jesus right who is jesus&nbsp;
jesus is the son of god who came down from heaven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.480
fully god and fully man so that's hard to&nbsp;
understand this side of heaven honestly i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.440
still can't quite explain every bit of it but i do&nbsp;
understand this he was fully god which means that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.040
it means this jesus could have came and he had&nbsp;
all the power of god and chose to not use that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.440
he chose to come as a man just like us so he&nbsp;
struggled with the same things we struggle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.080
with so think about the hopelessness maybe you&nbsp;
felt before or some of the struggles you had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.720
jesus felt those he experienced those same things&nbsp;
now without sin without sin so let me just even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.520
start there so what is sin right sin is anything&nbsp;
you think say do or don't do that displeases god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.440
and that sounds like a very very childish way to&nbsp;
think but here's what i would say to this this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.680
something i hope that really speaks volumes to you&nbsp;
know what sin really is it's just not god's best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.600
sin is what separates you from god but really&nbsp;
it's not god's best but god has so much more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:29.280
to live a life that is full and free of the the&nbsp;
sin that so easily entangles us and lays us down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.800
so god's not sitting there saying oh you're such&nbsp;
a horrible person nobody say oh gosh i want you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.320
have something so amazing which is freedom from&nbsp;
that sin so god sent his son jesus to walk this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.720
earth as a again completely human as we understand&nbsp;
the same feelings we had but without sin why did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.600
jesus have to walk without sin on this earth&nbsp;
because in order to be able to pay for our sins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.080
there had to be a perfect sacrifice and here's&nbsp;
what god knew we couldn't walk in we couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.840
live perfect and because of that he didn't say&nbsp;
hey forget it if you can't live perfect then i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.000
you're not going to be able to have a relationship&nbsp;
with me it's been an eternity with me he said no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.120
i'll send my son who can walk a perfect life&nbsp;
and be the perfect sacrifice for you so jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:19.280
was hung on a cross for you and me for everyone&nbsp;
that was ever created god sent jesus to hang on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:25.040
a cross to suffer but die for us and that's a&nbsp;
hard concept and i'm not maybe expecting you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.240
understand that to a complete t today but what&nbsp;
i would say this is that that was the payment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.280
of our sin in order to come before god again&nbsp;
and have a relationship with god we had to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:41.280
have a perfect sacrifice and that was jesus&nbsp;
but here's the thing not only his death was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.040
the main part of this it was his resurrection&nbsp;
that's why we're talking about the resurrection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.440
today because if jesus didn't come back to life&nbsp;
he'd be like all the other gods that you hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.880
about that have died and never came back to life&nbsp;
but knowing our god jesus came back to life to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:00.400
conquer what death hell in the grave he conquered&nbsp;
your sin through a relationship with jesus by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.800
repenting of your sins and turning your life over&nbsp;
to him and asking god to use you and come and live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:10.320
with you and give you a life and a purpose you&nbsp;
can experience freedom from your sin so today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.720
that's how we got to the story and i know i just&nbsp;
did a quick summary and god's word really gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.520
you clarity on a lot more of those details that&nbsp;
i didn't share today but it's important to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.480
that his resurrection is part of the process&nbsp;
right to complete the process that he conquered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.640
again our sin and to give us hope despite maybe&nbsp;
our circumstances despite what we're physically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:36.320
going through or spiritually going through&nbsp;
god obviously loves us and he's pursued us

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.400
so i could have easily stopped there and said&nbsp;
okay hey we know what the resurrection's for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.720
we know god's story let's go home maybe we're&nbsp;
already ready to eat some lunch i don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.680
maybe we are but um there's more to this story&nbsp;
that i hope that you get out of this text that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.960
we're getting ready to jump into and we're going&nbsp;
to really start with verse 5 here and look at how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.880
these two ladies and this is what i love&nbsp;
about god's words is god's going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:11.440
people who really i would say this that speak to&nbsp;
us in a way that we can relate so when it comes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.200
ladies the ladies are always the first ones at the&nbsp;
party is that right the guys are always lagging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.840
behind that's what we see here today is the ladies&nbsp;
came into the party first so we know it's both of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.720
the mary's um in this but he says this in verse&nbsp;
five this is again the angel speaking of which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.920
just stop for a moment think about this imagine an&nbsp;
angel speaking to you that'd be pretty shocking so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.280
i think that's a pretty cool thing so the angel's&nbsp;
speaking to these two ladies and he says this the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.640
angel told the women don't be afraid because i&nbsp;
know you were looking for jesus who was crucified&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.280
these ladies were walking to the tomb expecting&nbsp;
to see a dead savior right the one that they had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.760
put all their hope and they spent all these years&nbsp;
following jesus saying hey he's the messiah he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.920
the one that's going to save us from our sins&nbsp;
and he died on the cross and their hope was gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:00.480
their hope was gone so they were going bringing&nbsp;
spices to be able to finish the burial process and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.560
and why would the angels say hey don't fear well&nbsp;
one because they were afraid that jesus's body had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:11.600
been taken away and i want to want to show this&nbsp;
verse from a different again the four gospels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.960
matthew mark luke and john give a different&nbsp;
account of this process but this is another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.520
verse where it gives us a little bit more of a&nbsp;
clarity here in john 20 uh verses 11 through 13 it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.720
says this but mary stood outside the tomb crying&nbsp;
and as she was crying she stooped in to look in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:34.880
the tomb and she saw two angels in white sitting&nbsp;
there where jesus's body was lying and at the head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.720
and at the other at the feet and they&nbsp;
said to her woman why are you crying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.880
and she said because they had taken my lord away&nbsp;
she told them and i don't know where they put them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:49.600
so you had that point her hope was still lost&nbsp;
she was worried about where jesus's dead body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:55.280
was that that she was hopeless and does anybody&nbsp;
remember where the disciples were at this point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.200
they weren't there uh even even after jesus&nbsp;
rose from the dead they were even caught out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.480
fishing again they wouldn't kind of back&nbsp;
their old ways of life for a while see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.000
they had lost hope as well so these ladies&nbsp;
were the only ones that had lost hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.800
and so at the moment of jesus death everyone&nbsp;
lost hope and everything they had put trust&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.840
in they'd lost hope but so let's just take some&nbsp;
time here and you may find this unique the more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.720
time that you spend with us here at inspire hope&nbsp;
you'll realize that uh i'm not the only one that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.320
wants to talk to it so let me get you guys&nbsp;
a bit involved in this when you think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.360
something you've lost hope and maybe it's just&nbsp;
not this last year maybe it's just in your life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.840
um what are some things that you've lost&nbsp;
hope in over the last year or in your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.800
lifetime maybe you're like you put all of&nbsp;
your hope in and you realized it couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.360
come through so what's something maybe you&nbsp;
put your hope in and it's falling through

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:57.040
security security security what let's just&nbsp;
expand on that health health okay so security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.800
of health right especially when you're young&nbsp;
you think you have all the control in the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.440
right so that's a great one what's another one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.200
what's something else when you put&nbsp;
your hope in and fail other people

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:15.600
yes other people will fail you and&nbsp;
i think if you if you've lived long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.440
enough and you haven't experienced that&nbsp;
oh my gosh but i'm telling you people will

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.840
what else keep going

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.920
anybody put your trust in maybe a job or money&nbsp;
next thing you know you lost it i know there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.360
lot of people in this past year that did the same&nbsp;
thing and man they're struggling right now right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:49.280
anybody and we won't jump off this anybody who&nbsp;
put their faith in the government there's a mess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.840
right so i hope you didn't but obviously that&nbsp;
right so there's a lot of things that that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.720
have put our hope in maybe in our lifetimes and&nbsp;
it's filled us see these ladies are not the only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:06.240
ones that's felt hopeless before and honestly&nbsp;
when we think about even believers that follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:12.800
jesus at times felt hopeless because of the&nbsp;
things we can control so just like these ladies we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.920
felt hopeless they were there for the tomb&nbsp;
because that all the hope that they put in jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.440
had dissipated in that moment but it didn't stop&nbsp;
there right this is the cool part this is the fun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:29.280
part i think of easter's it didn't stop in the&nbsp;
hopelessness and just to be real with you it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.400
doesn't stop in the hopelessness maybe that you&nbsp;
have and the things that maybe you've lost hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:41.920
in and so we look here at verse 6 and he says&nbsp;
this he is not here for he has risen just as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:49.840
said come and see the place where he lay at&nbsp;
that moment those lady realized hope is alive

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.240
i just i'd sit there and i&nbsp;
think and imagine this moment

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.280
of just hopelessness and then all of a&nbsp;
sudden they realize that it's flipped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:13.920
what he's risen what he's alive what does that&nbsp;
mean so again standing outside the tomb and just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.600
seeing the angel speaking one's shocking enough&nbsp;
but two to see that what jesus had said he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.400
gonna do he did now again i didn't see him and&nbsp;
this is the story where i love this statement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:31.520
right about god and if you live long enough and&nbsp;
you follow jesus you're gonna have a lot of god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:36.160
moments in your life moments where you thought&nbsp;
you were hopeless you thought everything was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.400
over or things were ruined i can't i don't know&nbsp;
how i'm gonna get over this i don't know how i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.080
gonna come back for this i don't know how to&nbsp;
trust people again i don't know how i'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.640
to understand to trust god again but god and his&nbsp;
mercy and grace ephesians 2 is one of my favorite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.400
um chapters in the bible where it talks about we&nbsp;
were dead in our transgressions right we were dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.680
apart from christ but he says in verse three&nbsp;
or four he says but god in his love and mercy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.520
see today we get to celebrate the god&nbsp;
right because god loves us so much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.920
he sent his son jesus not to just die on the&nbsp;
cross for our sins but to rise again to give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:19.280
us a hope that one day we will rise again in&nbsp;
eternity in heaven but here here's the thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:26.320
you'll hear here again more about our church we&nbsp;
really believe that if god has saved you that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.400
he's not saying just wait till you get to heaven&nbsp;
to go live the great life right to go figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.720
what it is in eternity to live sinless and to&nbsp;
have all these great things know god gives you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.720
the ability today to experience that hope today&nbsp;
to experience no matter your circumstances the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:48.640
hope that we have despite everything else that's&nbsp;
going on in our world amen so whenever i thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.920
about these ladies in the moment that that that&nbsp;
it changed in their perspective that hope was dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.800
and now hope is alive oh for you again it could&nbsp;
be a time where you think back and you're like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.360
man we're on our last diet and the next&nbsp;
thing you know you get a check in the mail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:09.760
maybe you get a job maybe it's a person who didn't&nbsp;
get sick this past year and they weren't doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:15.600
well and then something changed and maybe they&nbsp;
were obviously healed and you're sitting there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.920
going okay man hope's alive i was hopeless but&nbsp;
hope's a lot i think about this situation and i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:25.280
going to try to be very brief with this but um our&nbsp;
youngest daughter tegan i remember whenever she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.920
was a month old she was rushed to the emergency&nbsp;
room she was life flighted to another hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.280
and her condition was bleeding this is again&nbsp;
trying to be short version here but she had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.960
some lung issues that we had no clue about she&nbsp;
was on a ventilator she was on oscillator she was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:47.760
completely it was just amazing to see that they&nbsp;
could even keep her alive at one month old in less&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:54.880
than 24 hours we were celebrating at church a good&nbsp;
day at church to hopelessness i remember monday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.920
morning monday morning the doctor pulled us in a&nbsp;
separate room and sat us down here's what he said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.840
he said he need to start preparing for&nbsp;
the worst and that moment we were hopeless

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.960
but it seemed like day after&nbsp;
day you should begin to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.120
defy the hopelessness and we begin to see that&nbsp;
hope was alive and one of the things that that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.640
god grew us in our faith me and my wife's faith&nbsp;
was this that god was going to be glory to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.280
life of her death and we gave that all to god we&nbsp;
surrender that to all to god and god by getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:33.840
his his mercies and his miracles he saved her&nbsp;
and we realized in that instance hope was alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.000
and here's my thing with this guys not everybody's&nbsp;
story ends that way just because you have enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.920
faith god's grace and mercy allowed us to&nbsp;
experience that but i go back to that moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.880
because i think about these ladies hope was my&nbsp;
monday morning hopelessness was my monday morning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:56.880
just like these ladies going to the tomb uh&nbsp;
we were hopeless what is going on here to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:03.440
the moment that we realized there was hope right&nbsp;
like that that's the feeling where i think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:09.600
what god has given us we should wake up every day&nbsp;
going hope is alive hope is a lie because jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:15.600
has conquered the grave hope is alive is because&nbsp;
i don't care if my life ends today my hope is in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:21.920
jesus upon apart from this life like that that's&nbsp;
the things that i think of it in this instance and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:27.360
and it is difficult when some of our circumstances&nbsp;
seem hopeless when when when somebody doesn't get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.000
healed the way we want them to get healed or maybe&nbsp;
we don't get the job before we are deep in debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.360
right those are the moments where we're saying&nbsp;
okay well is there really hope in god and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:41.680
answer is yes god promises this at the moment&nbsp;
of salvation when you give your life to jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:48.880
he says he will never leave nor forsake you&nbsp;
if anybody gets to know jesus and those who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:54.400
followed him in the bible we realized that most&nbsp;
of them were in circumstances that were not very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.160
good but yet they found that hope was alive let&nbsp;
me give you a good example of paul the apostle if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.520
you begin to study any of his letters to churches&nbsp;
most of those letters he was writing from prison&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.960
he was writing from prison and you know most of&nbsp;
those didn't say hey please come get me out break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.880
me out pray for me you know what most of them were&nbsp;
saying hey no jesus is actually getting more glory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:23.360
through my imprisonment than as if i were free and&nbsp;
you know we are actually walking through the book&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.920
of ephesians on wednesday nights as a direction on&nbsp;
wednesday nights as sunday mornings as a group we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:34.560
just took a break and here's what paul's saying&nbsp;
he's actually prayed twice for the church not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.760
to get material blessing but to get a spiritual&nbsp;
blessing to understand all that god had given them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.000
and then for them to walk in that and to live&nbsp;
their lives as though they received the hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:52.560
that jesus gives so despite our circumstances&nbsp;
hope is alive and so both of these ladies teach us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.000
something when we look at this verse this is the&nbsp;
part i really want to look at he says he is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.040
here for he has risen just as he said you know&nbsp;
it's hard sometimes in life to trust the word of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:10.080
someone do they really mean it here's what jesus&nbsp;
did he backed up what he meant and so let me give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.640
you a couple of verses that he had shared with&nbsp;
his disciples and some of his followers before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.200
his death he said this in matthew 16 21 from then&nbsp;
on jesus began to point out to his disciples that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.320
it was necessary for him to go to jerusalem&nbsp;
and to suffer many things from the elders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.440
chief priests and scribes to be killed&nbsp;
and to be raised on the third day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.400
see jesus had already told them this was going to&nbsp;
happen and so the angel points back and he says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:42.000
remember jesus rose again just like he said he&nbsp;
would but it also says in john 10 17 through 18 it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.040
says this this is why the father loves me because&nbsp;
i lay down my life so that i may take it up again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:52.000
no one takes it from me but i lay it down&nbsp;
on my own i have the right to lay it down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.360
and i have the right to take it up again i&nbsp;
have received this command from my father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.920
so these ladies are sitting here listening to the&nbsp;
angels saying jesus followed through on this word&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:09.840
why earlier did i say god's word is truth because&nbsp;
god's word is trustworthy to cling to his promises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:18.480
to teach us that it's important to renew our minds&nbsp;
every day that god's word is good for us and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:23.440
i've been challenging even lately to some of our&nbsp;
team members that we have to to look at god's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.920
word daily because we have to renew our minds&nbsp;
daily because it's easy to get distracted that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:34.320
we're hopeless that our jobs are horrible and&nbsp;
there's no point in them and i don't know how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.080
we're going to make it through right maybe it's&nbsp;
again a financial situation or a relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:44.080
god's word helps us know that's not true and and&nbsp;
this is a statement i've heard from greg rochelle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.000
lately that just challenged me and says your life&nbsp;
is heading the direction of your strongest thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.240
well if you're renewing your&nbsp;
mind on your worries it'll be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:57.120
worthy and being consumed by what you can't&nbsp;
control if you'll renew your mind on god's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:02.720
word it will be god's word and his truth that&nbsp;
gives you the hope that you need every day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.880
so when we experience this hope from jesus through&nbsp;
a relationship with him what does that hope give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.800
us that our lives are meant for something more&nbsp;
than this life i just want you to know this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:19.200
that despite what happens to you on this&nbsp;
side of heaven god's got a purpose for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.000
that our life's purpose is more than just&nbsp;
ourselves guys we are so consumed by ourselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.440
and here's the thing yes we have to wake up&nbsp;
and take care of ourselves and be ourselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.960
but god has someone on the other side&nbsp;
of your obedience your walk with jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.240
that needs to see your relationship lived out&nbsp;
that hope lived out so there's a purpose for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:48.000
you not just for yourself but for somebody else to&nbsp;
see in you what what god has put in you that hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:55.120
the despire our circumstances god is with us that&nbsp;
we have peace that surpasses all understanding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:00.480
love that god forgives us right and he welcomes&nbsp;
us in our brokenness i'm just telling you this if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.720
you're in the state today and you're like you know&nbsp;
what i just don't have it together jesus can't use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:11.680
me no i would beg to differ that's exactly where&nbsp;
he can use you in your brokenness so here's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:18.560
last thing that that is so important in this text&nbsp;
they were hopeless and now they had hope that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:23.840
jesus was alive that he had said what he was going&nbsp;
to do he did and they remembered that again all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.800
those flooding emotions of all that god had told&nbsp;
them or jesus had told them he's fulfilling them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:36.320
but what are they doing what do you do with the&nbsp;
hope that you've experienced with jesus from jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:42.720
well i think it's clear when angel says this in&nbsp;
verse seven he says then go quickly and tell his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.440
disciples he has risen from the dead and indeed&nbsp;
he is going ahead of you to galilee and you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.960
see him there and listen i have told you and then&nbsp;
he says this in verse 8 so departing quickly from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:59.600
the tomb with fear and great joy they ran to&nbsp;
tell his disciples the good news so based upon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:07.600
what this angel told the ladies to go do with the&nbsp;
message that hope is alive that jesus has risen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:17.040
what should you do what should you do this is&nbsp;
what go tell how quickly should you go tell them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:25.760
like right away like you should be running i&nbsp;
mean now if you guys don't run then just briskly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:34.000
what works for you we see these ladies are a great&nbsp;
example they're sitting there and they're hearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.600
we've experienced this hope they didn't just sit&nbsp;
down and go this is great let's celebrate praise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:47.360
you jesus now i think we should stop and celebrate&nbsp;
but we should run we should run and we should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:53.120
scream hope is alive our lives should scream&nbsp;
hope is alive and they may say but but what i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:57.920
see in your life there's brokenness and and you're&nbsp;
suffering and you're struggling and maybe it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:03.600
financial issue whatever it is but but there's&nbsp;
hope in your life yes there is why because my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.520
hope is not determined but what happens on this&nbsp;
side of heaven but what has already happened

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.720
that god has already won that i've been given a&nbsp;
promise that i will be with him in heaven forever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:21.120
but i will also be used for god's glory this side&nbsp;
of heaven because i'm just i'll just tell you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.720
i shared this story a couple weeks ago there was&nbsp;
a time when i wasn't chosen for a t-ball team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.560
and i'm just doing this for a short because i&nbsp;
shared the voicemail i wasn't chosen to be on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.960
a teamwork team and i felt so defeated because&nbsp;
you know what that basically said you're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.040
good at baseball that's basically what you said&nbsp;
you're not going to baseball that defeated me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.600
you ever feel defeated that god couldn't&nbsp;
use you because maybe you're just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.760
not good enough or you don't know enough or&nbsp;
maybe you you have too much brokenness in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.240
your life or you're an introvert whatever&nbsp;
you are or not god's saying i can use it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:53.920 --> 00:29:02.480
i wonder why because it's god's power in you it's&nbsp;
not yours it's god's power in you it's not yours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.600
so this last couple of verses that&nbsp;
we looked at we have to go tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.960
we should run with joy to our neighbors our&nbsp;
co-workers and our city to tell them that hope is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.760
alive that the god of the universe desires to have&nbsp;
a personal relationship with them despite what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.760
they've done see jesus says in matthew 11 28 he&nbsp;
says come to me all you who are weary and burdened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.760
and i will give you rest i know about&nbsp;
y'all but i love going to sleep at night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:35.360
because i enjoy rest the hope that god gives&nbsp;
is rest in a world that sometimes is just so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:40.160
chaotic and the things i can't control but&nbsp;
i need that rest the rest that i have in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:45.440
jesus and how god's changed me is why i'm&nbsp;
standing here today moved from oklahoma&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.360
to proclaim that hope is alive because god has&nbsp;
changed me that much not because of what i've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.680
done but because of what he's done in me and&nbsp;
wants to do through me and through this church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.680
god is for you again god desires for&nbsp;
every person to come to faith in christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:08.240
and and this is just to get a challenge why are we&nbsp;
planting inspiring hope church because we believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:13.040
that the story that we have needs to be told to&nbsp;
every single person we know where did we start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.480
we started with those we knew we're going&nbsp;
to continue to start with those we know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.400
we're going to continue to share that with our&nbsp;
neighbors we're going to need to connect and serve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:26.320
our city because we love our city and we want them&nbsp;
to know that jesus is alive and jesus has a hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:32.480
for them despite whatever they're walking through&nbsp;
so for you this is just my challenge for you today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:38.000
maybe you felt hopeless maybe you're still in&nbsp;
that mistake of hopelessness maybe you're just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.720
wondering where is god you're wondering what the&nbsp;
next step is in your life and i could be speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.480
to somebody who doesn't know jesus but maybe&nbsp;
you do know jesus and you still feel that way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:55.040
don't beat yourself up see that's what we do is we&nbsp;
we look inwards and we say we're horrible people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.160
and uh we can't do anything but you know what god&nbsp;
does he looks at you and he says you know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:07.200
i can use you i can use you because i can&nbsp;
change you i can give you hope in the midst&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.000
of your hopelessness so if you felt that&nbsp;
way god is really just saying this today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:19.200
you can't change your circumstances&nbsp;
but i can so stop looking at yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.800
to fix whatever's going on and start just&nbsp;
surrendering to god and saying i need you

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:34.640
see i think at times we get sidetracked and&nbsp;
i think it's easy to forget how good god is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.720
and so maybe you've been living maybe&nbsp;
you walked away from god for a season&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.920
god is still saying my grace is sufficient for&nbsp;
you his love is made perfect in your weakness and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:52.480
your brokenness that's the god i love i need them&nbsp;
every day to forgive me as a church we exist to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:59.280
inspire hope to help people discover god's purpose&nbsp;
for their life through relationship with jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:04.400
and today that's the last thing i want to tell&nbsp;
you is that today god desires to have a personal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.520
relationship with you if you have never given your&nbsp;
life to christ today is a great day to do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:16.160
because there's no day better than a day like&nbsp;
today why because you're not promised tomorrow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:23.040
that that if you think about all that god wants&nbsp;
to give you in the fact of a relationship in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.840
the hope and the joy why would you wait one&nbsp;
more day i mean i don't know what you guys i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.640
when we get ready to go on a vacation i start&nbsp;
getting anxious for vacations a week before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:37.040
usually i get sick right before i go on vacations&nbsp;
because i'm so anxious to go on vacation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.240
see if if somebody would tell me&nbsp;
well you can go now i would leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:49.680
and go then right because i'm so anxious to get&nbsp;
to the vacation why would you wait one more week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.840
one more sunday because you gotta i mean that was&nbsp;
my story i gotta get it all together before coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:59.200
to jesus and no jesus says this no you come to&nbsp;
me and i'll help you get all together anyway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.360
you probably won't be all the way together for the&nbsp;
rest of your life because we still live in a world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.240
that we have struggles with sin but i'm going&nbsp;
to walk through that with you in your brokenness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:14.800
so today i just want to offer this i'm going to&nbsp;
be up here later back here at the connect table&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.920
next steps table if you have any questions&nbsp;
about following jesus giving your life to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:25.440
jesus what does it mean to even study god's word&nbsp;
what does it mean to pray i i whatever questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.960
you have to taking next steps towards jesus i&nbsp;
want to talk to you that's what we're here for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.000
um and here's the other challenge again if you've&nbsp;
given your life to christ and maybe you're saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.960
today was a message need to be here to to get&nbsp;
your life back on track i just pray today that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:48.560
repent of your sins and you you turn back to god&nbsp;
and you say god use me use me and if you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.400
know how can god use you you can come talk to me&nbsp;
it's not like i've got the great solution what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.760
i'm going to do is i'm going to share with you&nbsp;
biblical truths that god says how he can use you

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.480
god desires a relationship with all&nbsp;
of us that's why we celebrate today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:09.520
he didn't do that just to do it he did it&nbsp;
for a purpose he did it for you so let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:18.400
pray lord jesus we're so thankful in the war&nbsp;
your word lord as these ladies went to the tomb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:25.920
hopeless weren't they left with hope&nbsp;
realizing lord that you were alive and well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.680
and that proved to them lord that you did&nbsp;
not leave them or abandon them lord but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:37.760
it proved to them lord that you chose them&nbsp;
that you desire to spend eternity with him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:46.400
and so lord today i pray that everyone was&nbsp;
lord that heard your word today that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.120
walk away with that same excitement maybe&nbsp;
we walked in hopeless but we walk out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:59.520
hopefully or that we walk away changed&nbsp;
by the gift of salvation and the gift of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:04.160
a relationship daily with you through your&nbsp;
word through gathering together as a group

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.880
lord we all need you we know that so&nbsp;
lord do what only you can do today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:18.080
in changing lives lord we pray for the city we&nbsp;
pray for our neighbors we pray for those who work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:25.840
thanks to lord i pray that each one of us&nbsp;
takes it serious to run to share the hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.120
that we have so that others can experience&nbsp;
the same exact thing that we've experienced

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.800
lord we pray this amen
