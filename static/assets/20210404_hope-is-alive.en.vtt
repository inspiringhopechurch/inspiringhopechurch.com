00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.040
um so if you have your bibles with you today we're 
going to turn to matthew chapter 28. if you don't  

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.040
have a bible with me here's my encouragement i use 
um the holy bible app on my phone so if you don't  

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.040
have one with you you can download that um go to 
matthew28 if you don't have a bible with you and  

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.040
you want one before you leave or right now there's 
also one back here that we'd love for you to take  

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.000
one home with you again that's a great way to 
learn more about god's word but um we'll be in  

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.760
matthew 28 today and i just want to share this 
um one of the things that we value as a church  

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:44.800
is timeless it is truth um one of the things 
that i quote all the time it's john 17 17 that  

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.280
says his word is truth and so because god's word 
is truth we have the ability to gain wisdom from  

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.880
it knowledge to apply to our lives um and so i 
just really want to encourage you if you haven't  

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.000
been spending time in god's word or maybe you've 
never opened up god's word before um to do it and  

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.120
to begin to just explore what is in god's word and 
today we'll do that as well um so again we'll be  

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.520
in matthew 28 we'll start in verse one in just 
a second but today we're gonna be talking about  

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.920
how hope is alive and it was interesting um as 
a church um we actually you know probably most  

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.920
churches around i saw about 20 different churches 
promote online that they were having easter  

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.680
services and one of the things is as we promoted 
our church easter service um i had people tagging  

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.520
my hopes always alive almost like questioning 
that i had just made the statement that hope's  

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.720
only alive today and no other day so just to 
be clear hope's alive every day obviously today  

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.480
we're celebrating that that hope that we have in 
jesus is is alive and so um just want to share  

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.400
this with you when i begin to think about hope 
um hope is basically a failure and expectation  

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.560
um and a desire for certain things to happen from 
a biblical standpoint um our hope is desire um is  

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.760
really a desire based upon the promises of god so 
our hope is in god our hope is in the truth that  

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.960
god gives us through his word and the promises 
that he says he will never leave us or forsake us  

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.760
i hope that we'll have a life beyond this life 
as well and so i just want you to think through  

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.200
just a few things before we get started um and 
again i think we've all have probably lived in in  

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.560
an interesting world over the last year so let me 
let me ask you this question and just to give you  

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.600
your own self-assessment you can answer you 
don't have to answer out loud for this but  

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.240
um how many of you over the last year had a point 
where you felt hopeless maybe there was something  

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.480
that was out of your control that you thought 
you always had controls you feel hopeless anyway  

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.760
i know i have um what about this is is there some 
things or some people in your life that maybe have  

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.520
let you down specifically in the last six months 
maybe even uh when we think about what's let us  

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.320
down maybe it's just it really could be family but 
it really could even be those that we're close to  

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.320
uh in our work but also i would even say just in 
our world right in the control that we thought  

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.320
we had as a as a country when it comes to 
sickness when it comes to political issues  

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.080
we've felt probably hopeless so let me ask 
this last question how many of you all know  

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.840
that there is hope to be found outside 
of the things that maybe we have lost

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.480
i hope that you do know that i hope if you don't 
know that but by the end today you will know that  

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.440
but hope is alive um and really despite your 
circumstances despite what we've all gone  

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.160
through and what we may continue to go through 
that doesn't change and here's the reason why i  

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.880
want to mention this um does the sun stop shining 
when it gets dark anybody this is probably it  

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.400
doesn't it's always shining just maybe not here 
just on the other side of the world see that's  

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.920
the hope that we have in jesus that jesus is 
always present despite the darkness that maybe  

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.480
we have in our lives i'm thankful for the presence 
of jesus today and so today i'm going to start  

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.800
reading again matthew 28 verses 1 through 8. and 
this is what it says it says after the sabbath  

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.720
as the first day of the week was dawning mary 
magdalene and the other mary went to view the tomb  

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.320
and there was a violent earthquake because an 
angel of the lord had descended from heaven  

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.720
and approached the tomb he rolled back the 
stone and was sustained air was sitting on him  

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.560
his appearance was like lightning and his clothing 
was as white as snow and the guards were so shaken  

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.200
by fear of him that they became like dead men the 
angel told the woman or the women don't be afraid  

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.160
because i know you are looking for jesus who was 
crucified he is not here for he has risen just as  

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.440
he had said come and see the place where he lay 
then go quickly and tell his disciples he has  

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.960
risen from the dead and indeed he's going ahead 
and used galilee well you will see him there  

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.280
listen i have told you so departed quickly from 
the tomb with fear and great joy they ran to tell  

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.120
his disciples the news let's take some time to 
pray lord jesus again we're thankful for today  

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.600
thankful for the opportunity to open your word 
and lord i just pray that your presence is here  

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.040
um that you meet with each person lord 
individually lord i pray that as they are  

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.680
walking through and processing or what you have to 
tell them i pray that they individualize the lord  

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.080
that they are challenged lord to continue to live 
their lives out for you and lord if they don't  

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.720
know you i pray that they come to know you before 
they leave today and so will we just pray this

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:40.400
amen before we jump into this text i want to 
catch you up see there's every you ever get in  

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.440
the middle of a story where somebody's sharing 
with somebody else and you're like whoa you got  

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.840
to back up that was the moment i felt whenever 
i began to prepare for today's message was  

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.080
hey wait where were we how did we even get to this 
point where hey he's risen hope's alive right how  

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.920
do we get to that point so i'm just going to kind 
of do a quick summary of really what has happened  

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:06.160
at this point um and if you notice this is this is 
a challenge to you you ever hear something so many  

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.760
times you're like yeah i've heard that before 
i pray today that you think of the story that  

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.720
i'm getting ready to share with you from a new 
perspective let it be refreshing i believe that  

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.080
there is power remembering what god has done right 
so in the beginning god created everything right  

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.360
god created everything this world everything that 
we see us his greatest creation was you and me  

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.160
and obviously in the beginning that was out of 
need right in the beginning god walked in peace  

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.480
with man and that was his goal right but what we 
all know or if you've been around maybe church  

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.240
enough that sin came into the world right adam and 
eve chose to disobey god and in the midst of that  

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.200
disobedience god can be in the presence of sin 
and so what did he do he obviously he kicked  

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.720
them out of the garden i mean but he didn't leave 
him in that condition see that's where the broken  

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.320
relationship between god and man happened long 
time ago but here's the thing we still haven't  

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.240
solved that right permanently there's 
still a broken relationship between  

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:10.720
god and man except for the son jesus that he 
sent to be able to help that broken relationship  

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:18.320
and so what did god do god after sending adam 
and eve out of the garden he began to run after  

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.000
everyone he created because he loved them so 
much he says i don't want to see this broken  

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.040
relationship stay this way so he says the only 
way for this to be solved is to send my son jesus  

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.920
so this is where we get jesus right who is jesus 
jesus is the son of god who came down from heaven  

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.480
fully god and fully man so that's hard to 
understand this side of heaven honestly i  

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.440
still can't quite explain every bit of it but i do 
understand this he was fully god which means that  

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.040
it means this jesus could have came and he had 
all the power of god and chose to not use that  

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.440
he chose to come as a man just like us so he 
struggled with the same things we struggle  

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.080
with so think about the hopelessness maybe you 
felt before or some of the struggles you had  

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.720
jesus felt those he experienced those same things 
now without sin without sin so let me just even  

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.520
start there so what is sin right sin is anything 
you think say do or don't do that displeases god  

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.440
and that sounds like a very very childish way to 
think but here's what i would say to this this is  

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.680
something i hope that really speaks volumes to you 
know what sin really is it's just not god's best  

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.600
sin is what separates you from god but really 
it's not god's best but god has so much more  

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:29.280
to live a life that is full and free of the the 
sin that so easily entangles us and lays us down  

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.800
so god's not sitting there saying oh you're such 
a horrible person nobody say oh gosh i want you to  

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.320
have something so amazing which is freedom from 
that sin so god sent his son jesus to walk this  

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.720
earth as a again completely human as we understand 
the same feelings we had but without sin why did  

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.600
jesus have to walk without sin on this earth 
because in order to be able to pay for our sins  

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.080
there had to be a perfect sacrifice and here's 
what god knew we couldn't walk in we couldn't  

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.840
live perfect and because of that he didn't say 
hey forget it if you can't live perfect then i'm  

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.000
you're not going to be able to have a relationship 
with me it's been an eternity with me he said no  

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.120
i'll send my son who can walk a perfect life 
and be the perfect sacrifice for you so jesus  

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:19.280
was hung on a cross for you and me for everyone 
that was ever created god sent jesus to hang on  

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:25.040
a cross to suffer but die for us and that's a 
hard concept and i'm not maybe expecting you to  

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.240
understand that to a complete t today but what 
i would say this is that that was the payment  

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.280
of our sin in order to come before god again 
and have a relationship with god we had to  

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:41.280
have a perfect sacrifice and that was jesus 
but here's the thing not only his death was  

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.040
the main part of this it was his resurrection 
that's why we're talking about the resurrection  

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.440
today because if jesus didn't come back to life 
he'd be like all the other gods that you hear  

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.880
about that have died and never came back to life 
but knowing our god jesus came back to life to  

00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:00.400
conquer what death hell in the grave he conquered 
your sin through a relationship with jesus by  

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.800
repenting of your sins and turning your life over 
to him and asking god to use you and come and live  

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:10.320
with you and give you a life and a purpose you 
can experience freedom from your sin so today  

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.720
that's how we got to the story and i know i just 
did a quick summary and god's word really gives  

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.520
you clarity on a lot more of those details that 
i didn't share today but it's important to know  

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.480
that his resurrection is part of the process 
right to complete the process that he conquered  

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.640
again our sin and to give us hope despite maybe 
our circumstances despite what we're physically  

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:36.320
going through or spiritually going through 
god obviously loves us and he's pursued us

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.400
so i could have easily stopped there and said 
okay hey we know what the resurrection's for  

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.720
we know god's story let's go home maybe we're 
already ready to eat some lunch i don't know  

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.680
maybe we are but um there's more to this story 
that i hope that you get out of this text that  

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.960
we're getting ready to jump into and we're going 
to really start with verse 5 here and look at how  

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.880
these two ladies and this is what i love 
about god's words is god's going to use  

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:11.440
people who really i would say this that speak to 
us in a way that we can relate so when it comes to  

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.200
ladies the ladies are always the first ones at the 
party is that right the guys are always lagging  

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.840
behind that's what we see here today is the ladies 
came into the party first so we know it's both of  

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.720
the mary's um in this but he says this in verse 
five this is again the angel speaking of which  

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.920
just stop for a moment think about this imagine an 
angel speaking to you that'd be pretty shocking so  

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.280
i think that's a pretty cool thing so the angel's 
speaking to these two ladies and he says this the  

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.640
angel told the women don't be afraid because i 
know you were looking for jesus who was crucified  

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.280
these ladies were walking to the tomb expecting 
to see a dead savior right the one that they had  

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.760
put all their hope and they spent all these years 
following jesus saying hey he's the messiah he's  

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.920
the one that's going to save us from our sins 
and he died on the cross and their hope was gone  

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:00.480
their hope was gone so they were going bringing 
spices to be able to finish the burial process and  

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.560
and why would the angels say hey don't fear well 
one because they were afraid that jesus's body had  

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:11.600
been taken away and i want to want to show this 
verse from a different again the four gospels  

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.960
matthew mark luke and john give a different 
account of this process but this is another  

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.520
verse where it gives us a little bit more of a 
clarity here in john 20 uh verses 11 through 13 it  

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.720
says this but mary stood outside the tomb crying 
and as she was crying she stooped in to look in  

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:34.880
the tomb and she saw two angels in white sitting 
there where jesus's body was lying and at the head  

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.720
and at the other at the feet and they 
said to her woman why are you crying  

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.880
and she said because they had taken my lord away 
she told them and i don't know where they put them  

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:49.600
so you had that point her hope was still lost 
she was worried about where jesus's dead body  

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:55.280
was that that she was hopeless and does anybody 
remember where the disciples were at this point  

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.200
they weren't there uh even even after jesus 
rose from the dead they were even caught out  

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.480
fishing again they wouldn't kind of back 
their old ways of life for a while see  

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.000
they had lost hope as well so these ladies 
were the only ones that had lost hope  

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.800
and so at the moment of jesus death everyone 
lost hope and everything they had put trust  

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.840
in they'd lost hope but so let's just take some 
time here and you may find this unique the more  

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.720
time that you spend with us here at inspire hope 
you'll realize that uh i'm not the only one that  

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.320
wants to talk to it so let me get you guys 
a bit involved in this when you think about  

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.360
something you've lost hope and maybe it's just 
not this last year maybe it's just in your life  

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.840
um what are some things that you've lost 
hope in over the last year or in your  

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.800
lifetime maybe you're like you put all of 
your hope in and you realized it couldn't  

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.360
come through so what's something maybe you 
put your hope in and it's falling through

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:57.040
security security security what let's just 
expand on that health health okay so security  

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.800
of health right especially when you're young 
you think you have all the control in the world  

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.440
right so that's a great one what's another one  

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.200
what's something else when you put 
your hope in and fail other people

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:15.600
yes other people will fail you and 
i think if you if you've lived long  

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.440
enough and you haven't experienced that 
oh my gosh but i'm telling you people will

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.840
what else keep going

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.920
anybody put your trust in maybe a job or money 
next thing you know you lost it i know there's a  

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.360
lot of people in this past year that did the same 
thing and man they're struggling right now right  

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:49.280
anybody and we won't jump off this anybody who 
put their faith in the government there's a mess  

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.840
right so i hope you didn't but obviously that 
right so there's a lot of things that that we  

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.720
have put our hope in maybe in our lifetimes and 
it's filled us see these ladies are not the only  

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:06.240
ones that's felt hopeless before and honestly 
when we think about even believers that follow  

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:12.800
jesus at times felt hopeless because of the 
things we can control so just like these ladies we  

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.920
felt hopeless they were there for the tomb 
because that all the hope that they put in jesus  

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.440
had dissipated in that moment but it didn't stop 
there right this is the cool part this is the fun  

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:29.280
part i think of easter's it didn't stop in the 
hopelessness and just to be real with you it  

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.400
doesn't stop in the hopelessness maybe that you 
have and the things that maybe you've lost hope  

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:41.920
in and so we look here at verse 6 and he says 
this he is not here for he has risen just as he  

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:49.840
said come and see the place where he lay at 
that moment those lady realized hope is alive

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.240
i just i'd sit there and i 
think and imagine this moment

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.280
of just hopelessness and then all of a 
sudden they realize that it's flipped  

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:13.920
what he's risen what he's alive what does that 
mean so again standing outside the tomb and just  

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.600
seeing the angel speaking one's shocking enough 
but two to see that what jesus had said he was  

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.400
gonna do he did now again i didn't see him and 
this is the story where i love this statement  

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:31.520
right about god and if you live long enough and 
you follow jesus you're gonna have a lot of god  

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:36.160
moments in your life moments where you thought 
you were hopeless you thought everything was  

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.400
over or things were ruined i can't i don't know 
how i'm gonna get over this i don't know how i'm  

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.080
gonna come back for this i don't know how to 
trust people again i don't know how i'm going  

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.640
to understand to trust god again but god and his 
mercy and grace ephesians 2 is one of my favorite  

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.400
um chapters in the bible where it talks about we 
were dead in our transgressions right we were dead  

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.680
apart from christ but he says in verse three 
or four he says but god in his love and mercy  

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.520
see today we get to celebrate the god 
right because god loves us so much  

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.920
he sent his son jesus not to just die on the 
cross for our sins but to rise again to give  

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:19.280
us a hope that one day we will rise again in 
eternity in heaven but here here's the thing  

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:26.320
you'll hear here again more about our church we 
really believe that if god has saved you that  

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.400
he's not saying just wait till you get to heaven 
to go live the great life right to go figure out  

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.720
what it is in eternity to live sinless and to 
have all these great things know god gives you  

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.720
the ability today to experience that hope today 
to experience no matter your circumstances the  

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:48.640
hope that we have despite everything else that's 
going on in our world amen so whenever i thought  

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.920
about these ladies in the moment that that that 
it changed in their perspective that hope was dead  

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.800
and now hope is alive oh for you again it could 
be a time where you think back and you're like  

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.360
man we're on our last diet and the next 
thing you know you get a check in the mail  

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:09.760
maybe you get a job maybe it's a person who didn't 
get sick this past year and they weren't doing  

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:15.600
well and then something changed and maybe they 
were obviously healed and you're sitting there  

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.920
going okay man hope's alive i was hopeless but 
hope's a lot i think about this situation and i'm  

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:25.280
going to try to be very brief with this but um our 
youngest daughter tegan i remember whenever she  

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.920
was a month old she was rushed to the emergency 
room she was life flighted to another hospital  

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.280
and her condition was bleeding this is again 
trying to be short version here but she had  

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.960
some lung issues that we had no clue about she 
was on a ventilator she was on oscillator she was  

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:47.760
completely it was just amazing to see that they 
could even keep her alive at one month old in less  

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:54.880
than 24 hours we were celebrating at church a good 
day at church to hopelessness i remember monday  

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.920
morning monday morning the doctor pulled us in a 
separate room and sat us down here's what he said  

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.840
he said he need to start preparing for 
the worst and that moment we were hopeless

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.960
but it seemed like day after 
day you should begin to  

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.120
defy the hopelessness and we begin to see that 
hope was alive and one of the things that that  

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.640
god grew us in our faith me and my wife's faith 
was this that god was going to be glory to her  

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.280
life of her death and we gave that all to god we 
surrender that to all to god and god by getting  

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:33.840
his his mercies and his miracles he saved her 
and we realized in that instance hope was alive  

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.000
and here's my thing with this guys not everybody's 
story ends that way just because you have enough  

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.920
faith god's grace and mercy allowed us to 
experience that but i go back to that moment  

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.880
because i think about these ladies hope was my 
monday morning hopelessness was my monday morning  

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:56.880
just like these ladies going to the tomb uh 
we were hopeless what is going on here to  

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:03.440
the moment that we realized there was hope right 
like that that's the feeling where i think about  

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:09.600
what god has given us we should wake up every day 
going hope is alive hope is a lie because jesus  

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:15.600
has conquered the grave hope is alive is because 
i don't care if my life ends today my hope is in  

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:21.920
jesus upon apart from this life like that that's 
the things that i think of it in this instance and  

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:27.360
and it is difficult when some of our circumstances 
seem hopeless when when when somebody doesn't get  

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.000
healed the way we want them to get healed or maybe 
we don't get the job before we are deep in debt  

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.360
right those are the moments where we're saying 
okay well is there really hope in god and the  

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:41.680
answer is yes god promises this at the moment 
of salvation when you give your life to jesus  

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:48.880
he says he will never leave nor forsake you 
if anybody gets to know jesus and those who  

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:54.400
followed him in the bible we realized that most 
of them were in circumstances that were not very  

00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.160
good but yet they found that hope was alive let 
me give you a good example of paul the apostle if  

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.520
you begin to study any of his letters to churches 
most of those letters he was writing from prison  

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.960
he was writing from prison and you know most of 
those didn't say hey please come get me out break  

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.880
me out pray for me you know what most of them were 
saying hey no jesus is actually getting more glory  

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:23.360
through my imprisonment than as if i were free and 
you know we are actually walking through the book  

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.920
of ephesians on wednesday nights as a direction on 
wednesday nights as sunday mornings as a group we  

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:34.560
just took a break and here's what paul's saying 
he's actually prayed twice for the church not  

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.760
to get material blessing but to get a spiritual 
blessing to understand all that god had given them  

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.000
and then for them to walk in that and to live 
their lives as though they received the hope  

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:52.560
that jesus gives so despite our circumstances 
hope is alive and so both of these ladies teach us  

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.000
something when we look at this verse this is the 
part i really want to look at he says he is not  

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.040
here for he has risen just as he said you know 
it's hard sometimes in life to trust the word of  

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:10.080
someone do they really mean it here's what jesus 
did he backed up what he meant and so let me give  

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.640
you a couple of verses that he had shared with 
his disciples and some of his followers before  

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.200
his death he said this in matthew 16 21 from then 
on jesus began to point out to his disciples that  

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.320
it was necessary for him to go to jerusalem 
and to suffer many things from the elders  

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.440
chief priests and scribes to be killed 
and to be raised on the third day  

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.400
see jesus had already told them this was going to 
happen and so the angel points back and he says  

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:42.000
remember jesus rose again just like he said he 
would but it also says in john 10 17 through 18 it  

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.040
says this this is why the father loves me because 
i lay down my life so that i may take it up again  

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:52.000
no one takes it from me but i lay it down 
on my own i have the right to lay it down  

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.360
and i have the right to take it up again i 
have received this command from my father  

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.920
so these ladies are sitting here listening to the 
angels saying jesus followed through on this word  

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:09.840
why earlier did i say god's word is truth because 
god's word is trustworthy to cling to his promises  

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:18.480
to teach us that it's important to renew our minds 
every day that god's word is good for us and and  

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:23.440
i've been challenging even lately to some of our 
team members that we have to to look at god's  

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.920
word daily because we have to renew our minds 
daily because it's easy to get distracted that  

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:34.320
we're hopeless that our jobs are horrible and 
there's no point in them and i don't know how  

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.080
we're going to make it through right maybe it's 
again a financial situation or a relationship  

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:44.080
god's word helps us know that's not true and and 
this is a statement i've heard from greg rochelle  

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.000
lately that just challenged me and says your life 
is heading the direction of your strongest thought  

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.240
well if you're renewing your 
mind on your worries it'll be  

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:57.120
worthy and being consumed by what you can't 
control if you'll renew your mind on god's  

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:02.720
word it will be god's word and his truth that 
gives you the hope that you need every day  

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.880
so when we experience this hope from jesus through 
a relationship with him what does that hope give  

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.800
us that our lives are meant for something more 
than this life i just want you to know this  

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:19.200
that despite what happens to you on this 
side of heaven god's got a purpose for you  

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.000
that our life's purpose is more than just 
ourselves guys we are so consumed by ourselves  

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.440
and here's the thing yes we have to wake up 
and take care of ourselves and be ourselves  

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.960
but god has someone on the other side 
of your obedience your walk with jesus  

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.240
that needs to see your relationship lived out 
that hope lived out so there's a purpose for  

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:48.000
you not just for yourself but for somebody else to 
see in you what what god has put in you that hope  

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:55.120
the despire our circumstances god is with us that 
we have peace that surpasses all understanding the  

00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:00.480
love that god forgives us right and he welcomes 
us in our brokenness i'm just telling you this if  

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.720
you're in the state today and you're like you know 
what i just don't have it together jesus can't use  

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:11.680
me no i would beg to differ that's exactly where 
he can use you in your brokenness so here's the  

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:18.560
last thing that that is so important in this text 
they were hopeless and now they had hope that  

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:23.840
jesus was alive that he had said what he was going 
to do he did and they remembered that again all  

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.800
those flooding emotions of all that god had told 
them or jesus had told them he's fulfilling them  

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:36.320
but what are they doing what do you do with the 
hope that you've experienced with jesus from jesus  

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:42.720
well i think it's clear when angel says this in 
verse seven he says then go quickly and tell his  

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.440
disciples he has risen from the dead and indeed 
he is going ahead of you to galilee and you will  

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.960
see him there and listen i have told you and then 
he says this in verse 8 so departing quickly from  

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:59.600
the tomb with fear and great joy they ran to 
tell his disciples the good news so based upon  

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:07.600
what this angel told the ladies to go do with the 
message that hope is alive that jesus has risen  

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:17.040
what should you do what should you do this is 
what go tell how quickly should you go tell them  

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:25.760
like right away like you should be running i 
mean now if you guys don't run then just briskly  

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:34.000
what works for you we see these ladies are a great 
example they're sitting there and they're hearing  

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.600
we've experienced this hope they didn't just sit 
down and go this is great let's celebrate praise  

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:47.360
you jesus now i think we should stop and celebrate 
but we should run we should run and we should  

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:53.120
scream hope is alive our lives should scream 
hope is alive and they may say but but what i  

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:57.920
see in your life there's brokenness and and you're 
suffering and you're struggling and maybe it's a  

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:03.600
financial issue whatever it is but but there's 
hope in your life yes there is why because my  

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.520
hope is not determined but what happens on this 
side of heaven but what has already happened

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.720
that god has already won that i've been given a 
promise that i will be with him in heaven forever  

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:21.120
but i will also be used for god's glory this side 
of heaven because i'm just i'll just tell you  

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.720
i shared this story a couple weeks ago there was 
a time when i wasn't chosen for a t-ball team  

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.560
and i'm just doing this for a short because i 
shared the voicemail i wasn't chosen to be on  

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.960
a teamwork team and i felt so defeated because 
you know what that basically said you're not  

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.040
good at baseball that's basically what you said 
you're not going to baseball that defeated me  

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.600
you ever feel defeated that god couldn't 
use you because maybe you're just  

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.760
not good enough or you don't know enough or 
maybe you you have too much brokenness in  

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.240
your life or you're an introvert whatever 
you are or not god's saying i can use it  

00:28:53.920 --> 00:29:02.480
i wonder why because it's god's power in you it's 
not yours it's god's power in you it's not yours  

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.600
so this last couple of verses that 
we looked at we have to go tell  

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.960
we should run with joy to our neighbors our 
co-workers and our city to tell them that hope is  

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.760
alive that the god of the universe desires to have 
a personal relationship with them despite what  

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.760
they've done see jesus says in matthew 11 28 he 
says come to me all you who are weary and burdened  

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.760
and i will give you rest i know about 
y'all but i love going to sleep at night  

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:35.360
because i enjoy rest the hope that god gives 
is rest in a world that sometimes is just so  

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:40.160
chaotic and the things i can't control but 
i need that rest the rest that i have in  

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:45.440
jesus and how god's changed me is why i'm 
standing here today moved from oklahoma  

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.360
to proclaim that hope is alive because god has 
changed me that much not because of what i've  

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.680
done but because of what he's done in me and 
wants to do through me and through this church  

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.680
god is for you again god desires for 
every person to come to faith in christ  

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:08.240
and and this is just to get a challenge why are we 
planting inspiring hope church because we believe  

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:13.040
that the story that we have needs to be told to 
every single person we know where did we start  

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.480
we started with those we knew we're going 
to continue to start with those we know  

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.400
we're going to continue to share that with our 
neighbors we're going to need to connect and serve  

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:26.320
our city because we love our city and we want them 
to know that jesus is alive and jesus has a hope  

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:32.480
for them despite whatever they're walking through 
so for you this is just my challenge for you today  

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:38.000
maybe you felt hopeless maybe you're still in 
that mistake of hopelessness maybe you're just  

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.720
wondering where is god you're wondering what the 
next step is in your life and i could be speaking  

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.480
to somebody who doesn't know jesus but maybe 
you do know jesus and you still feel that way  

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:55.040
don't beat yourself up see that's what we do is we 
we look inwards and we say we're horrible people  

00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.160
and uh we can't do anything but you know what god 
does he looks at you and he says you know what  

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:07.200
i can use you i can use you because i can 
change you i can give you hope in the midst  

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.000
of your hopelessness so if you felt that 
way god is really just saying this today  

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:19.200
you can't change your circumstances 
but i can so stop looking at yourself  

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.800
to fix whatever's going on and start just 
surrendering to god and saying i need you

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:34.640
see i think at times we get sidetracked and 
i think it's easy to forget how good god is  

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.720
and so maybe you've been living maybe 
you walked away from god for a season  

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.920
god is still saying my grace is sufficient for 
you his love is made perfect in your weakness and  

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:52.480
your brokenness that's the god i love i need them 
every day to forgive me as a church we exist to  

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:59.280
inspire hope to help people discover god's purpose 
for their life through relationship with jesus  

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:04.400
and today that's the last thing i want to tell 
you is that today god desires to have a personal  

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.520
relationship with you if you have never given your 
life to christ today is a great day to do that  

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:16.160
because there's no day better than a day like 
today why because you're not promised tomorrow  

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:23.040
that that if you think about all that god wants 
to give you in the fact of a relationship in  

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.840
the hope and the joy why would you wait one 
more day i mean i don't know what you guys i  

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.640
when we get ready to go on a vacation i start 
getting anxious for vacations a week before  

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:37.040
usually i get sick right before i go on vacations 
because i'm so anxious to go on vacation  

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.240
see if if somebody would tell me 
well you can go now i would leave  

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:49.680
and go then right because i'm so anxious to get 
to the vacation why would you wait one more week  

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.840
one more sunday because you gotta i mean that was 
my story i gotta get it all together before coming  

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:59.200
to jesus and no jesus says this no you come to 
me and i'll help you get all together anyway  

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.360
you probably won't be all the way together for the 
rest of your life because we still live in a world  

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.240
that we have struggles with sin but i'm going 
to walk through that with you in your brokenness  

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:14.800
so today i just want to offer this i'm going to 
be up here later back here at the connect table  

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.920
next steps table if you have any questions 
about following jesus giving your life to  

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:25.440
jesus what does it mean to even study god's word 
what does it mean to pray i i whatever questions  

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.960
you have to taking next steps towards jesus i 
want to talk to you that's what we're here for  

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.000
um and here's the other challenge again if you've 
given your life to christ and maybe you're saying  

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.960
today was a message need to be here to to get 
your life back on track i just pray today that you  

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:48.560
repent of your sins and you you turn back to god 
and you say god use me use me and if you want to  

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.400
know how can god use you you can come talk to me 
it's not like i've got the great solution what  

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.760
i'm going to do is i'm going to share with you 
biblical truths that god says how he can use you

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.480
god desires a relationship with all 
of us that's why we celebrate today  

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:09.520
he didn't do that just to do it he did it 
for a purpose he did it for you so let's  

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:18.400
pray lord jesus we're so thankful in the war 
your word lord as these ladies went to the tomb  

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:25.920
hopeless weren't they left with hope 
realizing lord that you were alive and well  

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.680
and that proved to them lord that you did 
not leave them or abandon them lord but  

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:37.760
it proved to them lord that you chose them 
that you desire to spend eternity with him  

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:46.400
and so lord today i pray that everyone was 
lord that heard your word today that we  

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.120
walk away with that same excitement maybe 
we walked in hopeless but we walk out  

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:59.520
hopefully or that we walk away changed 
by the gift of salvation and the gift of  

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:04.160
a relationship daily with you through your 
word through gathering together as a group

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.880
lord we all need you we know that so 
lord do what only you can do today  

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:18.080
in changing lives lord we pray for the city we 
pray for our neighbors we pray for those who work  

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:25.840
thanks to lord i pray that each one of us 
takes it serious to run to share the hope  

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.120
that we have so that others can experience 
the same exact thing that we've experienced

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.800
lord we pray this amen
