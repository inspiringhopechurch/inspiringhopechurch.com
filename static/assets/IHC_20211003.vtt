00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.760
It's been a little while
since I've been up here.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.119
So I got to figure out what
I'm doing and how this works.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.670
I know one thing's key.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.590
I'm going to open the word of God.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.300
We'll pray at some point, if I cover those
two things, I think it's a win this week.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.880
I bet you guys, I mean, if we
can get in the word and we can

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.940
pray, then I think it's a win,
whatever else comes in between.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.570
I'm sorry.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.940
No, not sure what's going to come out.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.540
Um, but it's, it's great to be back
with you guys, you know, last week.

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:33.675
Um, you know, some of us were, were
able to go to different churches

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:37.815
and worship with other churches,
bring gifts to the pastors.

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:41.685
And, um, I heard back from almost
every single one of those pastors,

00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:44.595
um, and even some of the pastors
wives were texting Brittany.

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:45.285
And we're just so thankful.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.170
For our generosity and just
willingness to come and worship

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.790
with them and be kingdom minded.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.060
And so I think it was, um, I was
one of those things I was skeptical

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.360
like, will this work, will churches
embrace us coming and visiting?

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.019
And they did.

00:00:58.019 --> 00:00:58.650
And they loved it.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.030
And I think it worked out really well.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.710
And so great job.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.650
I just, I'm thankful that we
want to continue to be a church.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.759
That's not just about.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.550
Our facility, our place, our name it's
about his kingdom, his place, his name.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.970
Right.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.890
And when we do that and we're consistently
pushing ourselves to just be the church

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.520
where we are no matter where we gather,
we'll remind ourselves not to just

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.970
live our faith out inside these walls,
but we'll live it wherever we go.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.820
So I thought that was a cool
opportunity for us to go when.

00:01:28.095 --> 00:01:33.735
Um, we are back in the Jonah
series, um, which, uh, we had

00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:35.054
left off a couple of weeks ago.

00:01:35.054 --> 00:01:39.075
And so we're going to be in Jonah chapter
three and we'll start in verse one.

00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:41.625
We'll go through verse five,
uh, considered going through the

00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:44.715
whole, uh, chapter of, of three.

00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:46.815
But I think next week would
be a good week to kind of hone

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.225
in on a few different things.

00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:52.365
But, um, one of the things I just want
to start with and ask this question, um,

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:56.475
have any of you, and I'm hoping I'm not
the only one have any of you ever failed?

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.820
Miserably or made a huge mistake.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.120
Anybody.

00:02:01.815 --> 00:02:02.325
Okay, good.

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:04.995
So we all are in the same boat.

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:05.535
Right.

00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:08.805
And if I was still probably ask you,
Hey, can you tell me what that is?

00:02:08.835 --> 00:02:11.205
You guys would probably be
like, no, because I don't want

00:02:11.205 --> 00:02:14.355
anybody to know one of my biggest
failures of my biggest mistakes.

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:17.625
See, when I've been studying the
book of Jonah and it was kind

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:19.965
of, I've walked through this
and a couple of different views.

00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:23.325
One is like, how could Jonah do this?

00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:27.165
And quickly I've turned
to, how could I do this?

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.900
'cause I see myself in the place of Jonah.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.670
It's easy to just
somebody from the outside.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.270
Who's made a huge mistake
and made the wrong decision.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.110
Um, but I think for all of us,
we need to know that when we make

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.730
those mistakes, we make those, um,
uh, failures, whatever failures

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.620
they are that they don't define us.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.070
Right.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.750
Uh, God defines us.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.180
And so let me share with you
one of my biggest failures.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.880
So you guys can hear one
of my, so previous church.

00:02:54.345 --> 00:03:00.615
Um, we, uh, were vandalized, um, in
one of our student buildings, um, where

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:06.135
our staff offices were, they broke in
vandalized things, stole things, and the

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:08.984
worst part is not even the second part,
which means they came back the next night

00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:10.815
and actually set it on fire and it burned.

00:03:11.204 --> 00:03:14.055
Um, and we had over a million dollars
worth of damage and crazy stuff happens.

00:03:14.055 --> 00:03:17.385
So that's another story for another
time, but here's the mistake that I made.

00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:21.855
See every Monday I went over in my role.

00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:26.465
I would go over to the main worship
area, go to the safe and get, what

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:30.075
do you typically get out of the
safe after a Sunday morning money?

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:30.855
The offering, right?

00:03:30.885 --> 00:03:34.395
I got it, brought it over candidate,
all got all the checks, right.

00:03:34.395 --> 00:03:35.085
And all that.

00:03:35.775 --> 00:03:37.005
It was later in the day.

00:03:37.035 --> 00:03:38.505
I didn't have time to make it to the bank.

00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:44.145
So I put it in my desk and locked
it, you know, every other time

00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:44.865
that I've done that, which is.

00:03:45.735 --> 00:03:46.905
Did it make it the banquet rare.

00:03:47.175 --> 00:03:47.745
It worked.

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:51.135
I could have walked over, put in the safe,
but I didn't do it locked into my desk.

00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:54.345
No big deal, never had an issue, but
that night happened to be the night that

00:03:54.345 --> 00:03:56.775
this group came in vandalized and broken.

00:03:56.805 --> 00:04:00.495
So they broke into my desk and took
all the money out of the offering.

00:04:00.495 --> 00:04:02.954
Luckily they left the checks,
they didn't take the checks.

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:05.805
Um, and so that, that day I felt so bad.

00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:08.204
I knew what was right.

00:04:08.204 --> 00:04:11.835
I knew for me in my role, Hey, the
most logical thing is he to bring the.

00:04:12.615 --> 00:04:14.865
To the safe or go deposit
it, but I didn't do it.

00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:19.365
And then that, that really like, I was
struggling with that and are struggling

00:04:19.365 --> 00:04:21.464
with man, if I can't get this right.

00:04:21.464 --> 00:04:24.165
If I, you know, can they trust
me again to do the offering?

00:04:24.165 --> 00:04:26.415
And you know what I was so
thankful with, with our finance

00:04:26.415 --> 00:04:28.905
team, with my pastor was great.

00:04:30.295 --> 00:04:31.045
He understood.

00:04:31.045 --> 00:04:32.635
I was beating myself up bad enough.

00:04:32.695 --> 00:04:33.415
He understood that.

00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:34.705
I knew I would never do that again.

00:04:35.155 --> 00:04:37.945
Um, luckily insurance money
was able to, uh, they were able

00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:38.785
to give us that money back.

00:04:38.785 --> 00:04:39.985
So I mean, everything worked out right.

00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:43.375
But in the end, sometimes those
mistakes, those big decisions

00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:44.845
where we make a wrong decision.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.090
Define us, but they don't have to.

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.810
And so when I look at Jonah's story,
like in this, and so I know when

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.419
you think ahead on Jonah's story,
you can kind of get a little bit

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.969
negative view if him again, but
let's look at this in this place.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.549
Jonah's coming to a place
where he did repent.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:00.840
And we talked a little bit about this.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.159
His repentance seemed half-hearted, but
it's interesting how God's still use that.

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.289
And so if you want to
know if your failure.

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:08.780
You know, define you.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.030
If God can use people,
who've made major mistakes.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.830
Let me just give you a couple.

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:12.260
Number one.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.370
We already know Jonah, right?

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.450
Jonah ran from the Lord.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.830
Um, did not do a guy called them
to do, and God's getting ready

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.140
to say, Hey, I can use you again.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.430
And so Peter, if you remember, Peter,
Peter was the one that's so interesting.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.930
He walked with Jesus for three years.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.840
He actually, when Jesus
said, who do you say I am?

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.820
He says, you're the Messiah.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.690
The son of God.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.800
He denied Jesus three times
and said he did not know.

00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:39.015
Yeah, God.

00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:43.185
Still used him to be
the rock of the church.

00:05:43.215 --> 00:05:45.765
And actually we've been talking about
this a little bit and acts when we've

00:05:45.765 --> 00:05:49.275
been walking through discipleship is
Peter was a big part of the church, right?

00:05:49.275 --> 00:05:54.795
So Moses, you guys know Moses, his story,
Moses actually killed a guy, right.

00:05:54.795 --> 00:05:57.375
And some say it's in self-defense, but
he still killed the guy and then ran.

00:05:57.885 --> 00:06:01.665
And God still used him to
lead his people out of Egypt.

00:06:02.055 --> 00:06:04.635
So if God can use them, God can use us.

00:06:04.875 --> 00:06:06.855
And I think that's in a way
that should encourage you.

00:06:06.855 --> 00:06:11.385
And in a way you're like, oh gosh, Why
do we have to do these things that are

00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:14.985
big mistakes or, you know, big, big
things that, that maybe do not honor

00:06:14.985 --> 00:06:16.875
God, but, but God's still sees us.

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:18.465
And he still gives us a second chance.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:23.265
And so I just, I think that's so
important when we look at today's story

00:06:23.565 --> 00:06:25.665
that God is a God of second chances.

00:06:26.265 --> 00:06:30.225
Um, and so we're going to see in
this story that there's three people

00:06:30.225 --> 00:06:32.655
who God gives a second chance to.

00:06:33.345 --> 00:06:35.085
He gives a second chance to Jonah.

00:06:35.475 --> 00:06:36.855
He gives a second chance to.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.159
The people of Nineveh and in
the end, it's a picture that

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:43.170
he gives us a second chance.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.240
It gives us a second chance.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.740
And so when we walk through these, this,
this, this, I'm hoping that we'll learn

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.980
how we respond when God gives us a second
chance and how we shouldn't respond.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.430
Right.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.730
And that's how we shouldn't
respond in crying right now.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.719
You're agreeing.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.469
So, let me just give a quick overview,
because I know it's been a little while

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:05.880
since we've, we've jumped into this.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.929
So just, just so we're all on the
same page, Jonah, obviously prophet,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.679
he gets the word of the Lord, spoke
to him and really spoke through him.

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:16.679
So Jonah would go to people and he would
say, Hey, here's what the Lord says.

00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:17.700
Here's a prophetic word.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.929
And Jonah would do that.

00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:19.080
Right.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.130
That was Jonah's role.

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:24.210
Um, but we know that Jonah,
um, God spoke, Jonah ran.

00:07:24.924 --> 00:07:28.614
Uh, and God brought a storm to bring
him back in that second storm that

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:32.094
he brought was the well or the fish,
whatever you want to find that.

00:07:32.094 --> 00:07:32.395
Right.

00:07:32.515 --> 00:07:33.835
So it was in the belly of the fish.

00:07:34.164 --> 00:07:36.804
So Jonah goes through a half-hearted
repentance, kind of what we

00:07:36.804 --> 00:07:39.085
learned in this half-hearted
repentance at best, right.

00:07:39.085 --> 00:07:41.695
He was more selfish in his repentance
and he was worried about those

00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:43.195
who he was called to preach to.

00:07:43.825 --> 00:07:45.594
Um, and we see that God's accepts it.

00:07:45.594 --> 00:07:48.534
And this is the part where I had to
kind of take a step back as I began

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:52.195
studying this, even though I look
at what Jonah did as a half-hearted

00:07:52.195 --> 00:07:53.934
repentance, God's still accepted.

00:07:54.885 --> 00:07:57.045
'cause he said that he would use him.

00:07:57.045 --> 00:07:59.445
And so how do you know that, that
God said he was going to use them?

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:02.775
Well, one I'm reading ahead, but two,
we see something I didn't address,

00:08:02.775 --> 00:08:06.675
which is at the last time, which is
verse 10 of chapter two, where it

00:08:06.675 --> 00:08:10.395
says then the Lord commanded the fish
and it vomited Jonah out on dry land.

00:08:10.935 --> 00:08:15.255
Picture this, if you were out there
on the shore and you see this fish

00:08:15.285 --> 00:08:21.090
vomit Jonah out, like disgusting, Like,
this is, this is horrible, but still

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.680
got, that was God's sign of saying,
Hey, I've still got a plan for you.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.030
I'm a God of second chances.

00:08:28.215 --> 00:08:29.864
So let's jump into this Textless, read it.

00:08:29.864 --> 00:08:32.745
And we're just going to walk
through it and see how God gave

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:36.434
a second chance to Jonah, to the
Ninevites and really, even to us.

00:08:36.704 --> 00:08:41.115
So again, Jonah chapter three verses one
through five, says this, this is the word

00:08:41.115 --> 00:08:43.064
of the Lord came to Jonah a second time.

00:08:43.544 --> 00:08:46.395
He said, get up, go to the
great city of Nineveh and

00:08:46.395 --> 00:08:48.285
preach the message that I tell.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.650
So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh,
according to the Lord's command.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.330
Now, Nineveh was an extremely great
city, a three-day walk and Jonah

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.660
set out on the first day of his walk
in the city and proclaimed in 40

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.730
days, Nineveh will be demolished.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.870
Then the people of Nineveh believed
God and they proclaimed a fast and

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.830
they dressed in sackcloth from the
greatest of them to the least of them.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.860
Let's pray and invite God into this Lord.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.310
Jesus.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.770
We are just thankful
Lord for you and Lord.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:17.250
We just want.

00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:21.599
Uh, today to be a day in which
honors you, but Lord also a day in

00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:24.810
which each one of us has our hearts
and minds opened to your word.

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:27.959
And so Lord, I pray that you speak and
we pray this in your headline name.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:28.770
Amen.

00:09:29.729 --> 00:09:34.709
So the first person that God gave a second
chance to was Jonah, we see this right.

00:09:34.709 --> 00:09:35.160
Logical.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:35.490
Right.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.030
But it's interesting when you begin
to study about this, some people ask

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.430
this question who was more happy.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:47.340
To be out of the Belize or the belly
of the fish, the fish or Jonah.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.730
And some of us would say, well, obviously
Jonah, I mean, who would want to be

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.780
stuck in the belly of a fish, but by
Jonah been vomited out of the fish's

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.520
mouth, he had to go do what he did.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.460
Really dreaded doing, which was go to the
people of Nineveh and preach repentance.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.820
And we'll talk more about that as we go on
a little bit, but it's interesting here.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.860
So we're, I'm just working on and
walk through this verse by verse

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.890
and kind of see some things that,
that I believe God speaks to us.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.400
So the first thing he says is the word
of the Lord came to Jonah a second.

00:10:14.295 --> 00:10:16.995
So the question is when was the first
time, so we're going to kind of go

00:10:16.995 --> 00:10:19.995
back and forth between Jonah chapter
one and Jonah chapter three, because

00:10:20.355 --> 00:10:21.435
they really relate to each other.

00:10:21.435 --> 00:10:21.885
Right?

00:10:22.095 --> 00:10:25.695
So the word Lord came to Jonah a
second time, but in Jonah, one, one,

00:10:25.695 --> 00:10:28.425
it says the word of the Lord came
to Jonah summit, son of Amittai.

00:10:28.425 --> 00:10:29.445
So that was the first time.

00:10:30.315 --> 00:10:32.685
And so I want us to just stop and
think about this for a moment.

00:10:33.795 --> 00:10:37.065
God spoke to Jonah, not only one.

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:38.715
But twice.

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:44.895
And really as a prophet, Jonah would have
been spoken to by the Lord multiple times.

00:10:46.574 --> 00:10:47.805
Is that on an amazing feat?

00:10:47.805 --> 00:10:53.025
Like at times guys, we take
something that should be amazing

00:10:53.025 --> 00:10:58.335
to us and we view it as something
normal because it happens so often.

00:10:59.175 --> 00:11:02.775
You take it for granted, great example
every day that I get to wake up with

00:11:02.775 --> 00:11:07.575
my kids and my wife is a gift from
God, but at times I'm more frustrated

00:11:07.575 --> 00:11:10.875
about how slow they're getting up
and how much they're not listening to

00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:13.125
me and how much we have to do today.

00:11:13.125 --> 00:11:16.545
And the rush of the day that
I don't stop and say, man.

00:11:17.025 --> 00:11:17.715
Wow.

00:11:17.775 --> 00:11:18.435
Thank you, Lord.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.069
For these children and this wife
and the life that I have, we take

00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:27.510
that for granted, Jonah just heard
from the Lord a second time, right?

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.340
A word from Lord second time in this book.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:34.290
But there's multiple times where we
miss that moment where God speaks to us.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.000
So here's a question.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.959
Anybody ever here met a
famous person, anybody.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.340
Okay.

00:11:41.579 --> 00:11:42.270
A couple of people.

00:11:42.329 --> 00:11:42.780
Great.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.840
Did you meet a person like that?

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.199
That may be.

00:11:46.995 --> 00:11:48.685
You were in awe.

00:11:48.725 --> 00:11:49.515
And what I mean by that?

00:11:49.515 --> 00:11:51.645
Is this somebody that you would
respect well that you're like, wow.

00:11:51.645 --> 00:11:53.175
They would actually, I
got a chance to meet them.

00:11:53.175 --> 00:11:54.555
I don't know if that was a
moment for you where you're

00:11:54.555 --> 00:11:55.995
like, wow, this is really cool.

00:11:56.235 --> 00:11:56.595
Yes.

00:11:56.595 --> 00:11:57.375
No, I don't know.

00:11:57.944 --> 00:11:58.245
No.

00:11:58.365 --> 00:11:58.694
Okay.

00:11:59.175 --> 00:12:00.194
Let me go a step further.

00:12:00.194 --> 00:12:02.085
Cause I figured there might be a
few people here going, Hey, that

00:12:02.085 --> 00:12:05.865
doesn't mean anything to me and guys,
you have a way to knock this out.

00:12:05.865 --> 00:12:06.285
You're ready.

00:12:08.564 --> 00:12:12.825
Have you ever spoke to someone who,
uh, if that was pretty cute and maybe

00:12:12.825 --> 00:12:14.175
wanted to hang out with anybody?

00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:15.795
Anybody?

00:12:15.915 --> 00:12:16.365
No.

00:12:16.395 --> 00:12:16.935
Okay, great.

00:12:16.935 --> 00:12:18.675
So menu, you run that.

00:12:18.735 --> 00:12:21.105
You should have raise your
hand because your wife.

00:12:22.815 --> 00:12:23.415
Okay.

00:12:25.095 --> 00:12:28.275
So reason why I say that is, is
that some thinking through this,

00:12:28.995 --> 00:12:34.705
the moment that this woman over here
spoke to me at school, it was like,

00:12:34.705 --> 00:12:39.365
wow, this hot girl over here, that's
a couple of grades ahead of me.

00:12:39.365 --> 00:12:39.755
He's talking.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.080
That's a big deal to me.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.680
Right.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.790
And still to this day, I'll look
at her and I'm still amazed 18

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.530
years that we've been together.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.520
That she's still talking to me, honey,
I'm going to switch this back to God

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.380
though, because those are the things
where I don't want us to miss this.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:03.330
See, I think, I don't think, I
believe that Jonah had gotten

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.560
used to hearing the Lord's voice.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.640
And so when he spoke to him
the first time Jonah was so

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.780
used to it, it was kinda like.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.710
I can do what I want to,
but the second time he was

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.120
desperate for the Lord's voice.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.630
That's typically when we hear it is when
we're desperate for the Lord's voice.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.110
And so at these moments where I'm
just like, oh gosh, like Jonah,

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.700
got it the second time, but he
didn't get it the first time.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.810
How can I get it the first time?

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.800
I mean, don't take it for
granted that God speaks to you.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:29.760
So here's the question.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.840
How does God speak to us?

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.950
Give me some examples.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.500
How does God speak to you through this?

00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:38.145
So, can you hear from him
if you're not in his word?

00:13:38.235 --> 00:13:41.775
Like if that's one way and you're
saying, I don't hear from the Lord.

00:13:42.314 --> 00:13:43.125
Well, there's one way, right?

00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:43.935
You can't hear from him.

00:13:43.935 --> 00:13:46.665
If you're not in the word, what's
another way that God speaks to you.

00:13:49.555 --> 00:13:50.275
There are other people.

00:13:50.694 --> 00:13:54.204
So if you're not community with
people, if you're not seeking God

00:13:54.204 --> 00:13:56.665
together, you won't hear God that way.

00:13:56.665 --> 00:13:57.895
What's another way that God speaks.

00:13:59.365 --> 00:13:59.965
Conviction.

00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:00.355
Right?

00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:03.655
That means this, that if you have a
relationship with the Lord, you know, as

00:14:03.655 --> 00:14:06.925
you go about your life, that conviction,
the holy spirit light, the spirit of God

00:14:06.925 --> 00:14:09.955
inside of you is, is drawing you to him.

00:14:09.955 --> 00:14:11.245
What's what's what's another way.

00:14:11.275 --> 00:14:12.145
I'll give it one more time.

00:14:12.295 --> 00:14:12.865
One more thing.

00:14:13.705 --> 00:14:16.705
What's another word that
God speaks to us prayer.

00:14:17.275 --> 00:14:17.575
Right?

00:14:18.145 --> 00:14:22.405
So we sometimes take God for great.

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:27.505
C Romans five says that we have at the
moment of justification, which means

00:14:27.505 --> 00:14:30.925
at the moment of salvation, the moment
that we give our lives to Jesus, we

00:14:30.925 --> 00:14:35.365
have full access to God, through word,
through prayer, through other people,

00:14:35.365 --> 00:14:40.705
through the holy spirit, all those are
there, but we take them for granted.

00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:44.455
We take them so much for granted
where God speaks to us through those

00:14:44.455 --> 00:14:46.855
things, or maybe in situations.

00:14:46.855 --> 00:14:49.495
And we miss it because we are not.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.540
Seeking the Lord.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:52.800
We're not seeking the Lord.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.680
So he says this verse
against the second time.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.300
So we know Jonah didn't get
it right the first time.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:57.540
Right.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.339
He, he doesn't give up on.

00:15:00.435 --> 00:15:03.615
And I'm thankful that God doesn't
give up on us and I'll let you guys,

00:15:03.615 --> 00:15:07.065
because if it, God gave up on me on
my first mistake at the moment that I

00:15:07.065 --> 00:15:10.785
gave my life to him guarantee, I walked
outside the church and I made a mistake.

00:15:10.965 --> 00:15:13.455
So I'm thankful that God
gives us second chances.

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:17.025
And so Hebrews 13, five says this,
speaking of God, he says, I will

00:15:17.025 --> 00:15:18.675
never leave you nor abandon you.

00:15:18.675 --> 00:15:24.195
And so guys know this, those of you
who have kids understand this, you

00:15:24.195 --> 00:15:26.715
would say that to your child, I will
never leave you nor forsake you.

00:15:26.715 --> 00:15:27.285
And that has gotten.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:28.890
And a relationship with you.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.210
I will never leave you nor forsake you.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.580
No matter how many times you
disobeyed me, I may be frustrated

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.370
at you and there may be some
punishment from it, but I love you.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.330
And I'll never leave you.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.270
That is God, even when we miss the mark.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:40.410
Right.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.150
So it's, it's important to remember here.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.740
So God didn't just want Jonah to
accomplish his task or his mission.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.660
So here's, here's what
we look at this picture.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.970
It's it's I want to kind
of talk about the surge.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:55.200
We can look at this and
say, well, God used Jonah.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.230
He had him come out, you know, he's he
vomited him out of the fish's mouth and

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.140
he's going to use them again because
he wants his mission accomplished.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.400
And that's all God cares about.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:03.840
Well, yeah, sure.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.150
God wants the mission accomplished.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:10.320
And here's why there's 600,000
people in Nineveh that need to

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.300
repent or they will be destroyed.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.140
Yes.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.290
God wants to use Jonah to
accomplish the mission.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.380
Well, what I love about
this picture is that God.

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:22.605
I didn't just want to accomplish
the mission through Jonah.

00:16:23.055 --> 00:16:24.975
He wanted to reach Jonah.

00:16:25.635 --> 00:16:31.335
The one, the one you are so important to
God and all these billions of people in

00:16:31.335 --> 00:16:34.185
the world, you one are important to God.

00:16:34.485 --> 00:16:35.805
That is a big deal.

00:16:36.075 --> 00:16:36.855
That is a big deal.

00:16:37.665 --> 00:16:40.875
And so we understand this, that
the God obviously loves us, right?

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:44.295
So at verse two, let's move on to
verse two, he says, get up and go.

00:16:45.165 --> 00:16:45.465
Right.

00:16:45.465 --> 00:16:47.775
Get up and go preach the
message that I tell you.

00:16:47.775 --> 00:16:52.215
So let's look at Jonah one, two verse
or chapter one, verse two, it says

00:16:52.215 --> 00:16:55.605
get up and go to the great city of
Nineveh and preach against it because

00:16:55.605 --> 00:16:56.865
their evil has come up before me.

00:16:57.375 --> 00:17:03.885
See what we're seeing here is Jonah
verses in chapter one, verses one and

00:17:03.885 --> 00:17:07.995
two and Jonah chapter three, verses
one and two are the same thing.

00:17:08.055 --> 00:17:09.135
The Lord spoke.

00:17:09.165 --> 00:17:11.075
The Lord gave a command to get up and.

00:17:12.415 --> 00:17:15.235
Now the question is what did Jonah do?

00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:15.925
What did Jonah do?

00:17:15.925 --> 00:17:16.315
Right.

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.945
Um, and I want to make this
statement and I'm gonna move on.

00:17:19.945 --> 00:17:24.625
But do you ever notice sometimes
when it seems like you hear something

00:17:24.625 --> 00:17:27.235
for the first time, even though
it's been said multiple times,

00:17:27.235 --> 00:17:28.195
is that ever happened to you?

00:17:29.035 --> 00:17:34.915
Um, I've heard this statement that, um,
especially in the pastoral world, I've

00:17:34.915 --> 00:17:38.425
been told this, and I guess I hear this
as, when you get tired of saying it,

00:17:38.755 --> 00:17:40.375
somebody's just getting it for the first.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.310
And we're talking about mission,
vision, values, things like that.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.960
But when we think about when,
and I'll just is a great example,

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.070
Brittany will say something to me
and it's like, I acknowledge it.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.710
But then later she's
like, did you hear me?

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.760
I said this.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.129
And I'm like, oh, and I finally get it.

00:17:59.639 --> 00:18:00.510
It's that moment again?

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.320
I feel like with Jonah is this, it's
this idea of like, he heard God,

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.950
but he really didn't hear God, his
heart wasn't maybe prepared to hear.

00:18:08.625 --> 00:18:09.015
God.

00:18:09.465 --> 00:18:11.895
And so when God speaks, we
should get up and go, right.

00:18:12.135 --> 00:18:14.055
And he talks about this
to this great city.

00:18:14.895 --> 00:18:16.815
Uh, I just want to talk about
this for a brief moment.

00:18:16.815 --> 00:18:19.245
So this great city of
Nineveh is, is great.

00:18:19.245 --> 00:18:20.925
In two ways, we already
talked about 600,000.

00:18:21.885 --> 00:18:25.065
But it's also great in it's
disobedience to the Lord.

00:18:25.065 --> 00:18:28.455
And so, so you, so you fully understand
it because I brought this up at the

00:18:28.455 --> 00:18:31.695
beginning of Jonah chapter one, but
I want to mention again, the people

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:36.435
of Nana where people have horrible,
I would say horrible things, right?

00:18:36.435 --> 00:18:39.825
So they were not merciful to their
enemies and their enemies where the

00:18:39.825 --> 00:18:41.385
Israelites, which would be Jonah.

00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:42.075
Right.

00:18:42.615 --> 00:18:45.555
Um, so they used to impel people alive.

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.975
They used to be head people and stack
their heads at the entrance of the gate.

00:18:49.305 --> 00:18:50.445
And they used to skin people.

00:18:51.495 --> 00:18:53.175
Does that sound like a place
you want to go hang out at?

00:18:54.045 --> 00:18:58.005
And I bring about that
clarity of seeing this.

00:18:58.035 --> 00:18:59.985
Why would Jonah not want to go there?

00:19:00.375 --> 00:19:02.745
I mean, yeah, he doesn't want to go.

00:19:02.955 --> 00:19:03.975
Any of those things happen to him.

00:19:03.975 --> 00:19:07.875
So obviously he has that, but here's
the other thing is he was the enemy

00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:09.555
in the, in, in, in this picture.

00:19:09.555 --> 00:19:13.605
And so he was not only afraid for
himself, but he was like, why would

00:19:13.635 --> 00:19:15.585
I ever want to see them be forgiven?

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.855
Anybody ever made that
judgment upon somebody?

00:19:19.755 --> 00:19:23.985
But they should never be forgiven of this,
you know, or you hold that from them.

00:19:23.985 --> 00:19:25.485
I'll never forgive them of this.

00:19:25.755 --> 00:19:28.815
You become judge and jury in
that moment, whenever God is

00:19:28.815 --> 00:19:29.985
the only one that has that.

00:19:30.075 --> 00:19:33.915
And so even God, um, wanted
to save these people.

00:19:34.755 --> 00:19:38.595
And so there's two things I want
to mention in this is if you've

00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:44.265
ever thought that you can't be used
because of your obviously mistakes

00:19:44.265 --> 00:19:45.225
that you've made in your life.

00:19:45.825 --> 00:19:48.795
Look at Jonah, God's still using
Jonah with this half-hearted repented.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:49.920
Right.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.610
If you ever thought that you couldn't
be forgiven, look at the people that

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:59.040
God pursued so that they could hear
the truth and repent of their sins, no

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.750
matter where you're at in that spectrum,
God can still use you and forgive you.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.960
And so, um, when we, when we continue
to look at this, we, we can't miss

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:17.430
this, that as we, um, understand our
sin, We can't continue on in that

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.600
sin as though it doesn't matter.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.170
Cause this is the thing where I think
sometimes we get stuck with mint.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.930
So if God's going to forgive me, he
gives me a second chance, a third

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.020
chance, maybe a hundred chance, if
God is that good of a God, then that

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.190
means I can continue on sending.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.030
Cause it doesn't really matter.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:30.570
Right.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:32.010
Right.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:32.700
I mean, is that okay?

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:34.290
Anybody?

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:36.930
Okay.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.280
I'll answer the question.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.700
No, even Paul talks about that, right?

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.250
We should not continue on sinning
so that Grace May have been.

00:20:45.135 --> 00:20:51.044
Why because we don't truly, if we kept
on sending, we wouldn't truly understand

00:20:51.794 --> 00:20:54.075
basically the heart of what sin is.

00:20:54.075 --> 00:20:55.514
Sin is not God's best for you.

00:20:55.514 --> 00:20:58.635
Sin is direct disobedience to the Lord.

00:20:58.635 --> 00:21:02.385
And so God wants to save people
who recognize their sin, right.

00:21:02.385 --> 00:21:05.715
And repent of that and recognize
it is not good for them.

00:21:06.284 --> 00:21:09.955
So grace is extended when we recognize
our sinfulness and repent and turn.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.520
We can't miss that.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.410
So here's the cool news.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.260
Jonah heard the word of the
Lord for the second time.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.330
God gave him a message to preach.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:23.430
And verse three says that Jonah got up
and went let's let's read this specific

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.370
Jonah got up and went to Nineveh,
according to the Lord's command.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:28.680
He should have done that the first time.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.880
I mean, it's easy to look at this picture.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.790
He should have done that
the first time, but he.

00:21:33.015 --> 00:21:34.785
The story could have been
different, but he didn't.

00:21:34.795 --> 00:21:38.625
I think I mentioned this once before,
imagine this book with, with the

00:21:38.625 --> 00:21:42.615
first chapter that says the word of
the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai

00:21:42.645 --> 00:21:46.905
and Jonah went and preached and they
repented, we wouldn't have more than

00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:49.485
one chapter story could have moved on.

00:21:51.165 --> 00:21:54.825
And I'm giving you guys a couple of ways
to think through this, this message.

00:21:56.235 --> 00:21:58.965
Have you, have you ever thought,
man, if I would've made this decision

00:21:58.965 --> 00:22:02.775
two years ago, If I wouldn't have
went down this path five years ago,

00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:04.665
if I would've got my life right.

00:22:04.665 --> 00:22:06.735
10 years ago, my life
will be totally different.

00:22:07.005 --> 00:22:08.325
I don't know if anybody's
ever had that before.

00:22:08.325 --> 00:22:13.245
If you've ever just regretted not
making the decision earlier and

00:22:13.245 --> 00:22:14.535
wondering what would have happened.

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:16.095
See, I think about that
with Jonah's story.

00:22:16.095 --> 00:22:20.055
And I think about that with God's story,
because God has a plan specifically

00:22:20.055 --> 00:22:24.255
for you not to just fulfill his
kingdom, but really help you become

00:22:24.255 --> 00:22:25.785
all that he has designed you to be.

00:22:26.025 --> 00:22:26.595
And sometimes.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:32.430
We are delaying that experience of
what God has for us because of our

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.200
own disobedience and our own sin.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:39.690
So I mentioned this, um, before, you
know, our mission is to inspire hope,

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.950
right by helping people by helping
you discover God's purpose for your

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:45.780
life through relationship with Jesus.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.110
Have you ever asked yourself this
question and maybe you just need to

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:53.100
ask yourself this question now is, do
you live in a state of anticipation

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.290
of what God wants you to do?

00:22:55.215 --> 00:22:56.115
So I'm going to say it again.

00:22:56.415 --> 00:23:02.385
Do you live in anticipation every
day of what God wants you to do?

00:23:03.525 --> 00:23:06.555
Or do you live an unexpected life?

00:23:06.765 --> 00:23:08.475
That is merely a repeat of itself?

00:23:10.955 --> 00:23:14.435
See, I would say this, everybody in
this room's living one of those or

00:23:14.435 --> 00:23:16.475
the other, I'm going say it one more
time so that you can kind of let it.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.370
Are you living in a constant
state of anticipation about

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:21.389
what God wants you to do?

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.560
God's purpose for your life.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.970
Pursuing that everyday, asking
the question, being a part of a

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:31.320
community that strives to challenge
you to deliver that expectation, or

00:23:31.379 --> 00:23:33.149
are you living an unexpected life?

00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:35.670
That merely is on repeat
and just existing.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.520
See the first one for God wants you.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:44.370
The second one is where God is
saying and begging don't don't.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:45.870
Live that way.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.550
It is not a fulfilling way for you.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:51.209
And it is not a fulfilling way
for his plan for you and for the

00:23:51.209 --> 00:23:52.860
people that he has for you to reach.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.760
And if we look at this story,
right, Jonah was caught off guard.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.659
The first time God spoke to him,
he was not anticipating God.

00:24:00.659 --> 00:24:03.899
He was not fully surrendered
to God's will in that moment.

00:24:03.899 --> 00:24:08.550
So he ran because he wanted to keep
repeating what w what he was doing before,

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.899
because that was comfortable to him.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.189
So we ran.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.200
Well, if we look at the second part of
this, the second time that God spoke

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:22.629
to Jonah, he was anticipating now,
yes, he went through the rough seas

00:24:22.629 --> 00:24:26.320
and the belly of a fish, and you'd be
listened to the Lord at that moment.

00:24:26.649 --> 00:24:32.830
But every day, every day we should be
anticipating, God has a plan for you.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.129
Where are you pursuing it in the word?

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.590
And fellowship with other believers
in prayer through conviction.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.699
Conviction only happens through a
relationship with Jesus every day.

00:24:44.699 --> 00:24:45.840
God has that for you.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.219
And we see Jonah, obviously following
that this second time, and I just want

00:24:50.219 --> 00:24:54.330
to mention this verse God desires to
do exceedingly abundantly more than we

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:55.949
could ever ask or think through him.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.320
We should live in anticipation.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:03.620
So we see again, Jonah got up and he
went that correct direction, right?

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.800
The direction that God had for his
life, he could have got to read the

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.709
first time he didn't, but God gave
him a second chance to get it right.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.090
And, and I'm already getting to the
end here before I get there, but you

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:21.080
can choose today to not wait and get
it right today so that you don't wait

00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:25.639
for the hundredth time that God is
pursuing you and challenging you to live

00:25:25.639 --> 00:25:26.750
your life out the way he's called you.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.400
So God's got a second chances to
Jonah, but God's a, got a second

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.570
chances to the people of Nineveh.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.640
And this is where we get the
details of the second chance.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.030
So in verse four, it says, Jonah
set out on the first day of us

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.810
walking the city and proclaimed in
40 days, Nineveh will be demolished.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.520
You know what a great message.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.350
That was a really powerful message.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.230
If I preach like that every week, I
wonder how many people would get saved.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.030
And, um, I'll talk a little bit about
that in just a minute, but when we

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:57.075
think about this, Um, you may be
thinking the same thing Jonah did.

00:25:57.075 --> 00:26:04.065
How could he go as one person, their enemy
and lead 600,000 people to repentance?

00:26:04.665 --> 00:26:06.165
How could he do that?

00:26:07.635 --> 00:26:08.715
And there's one answer.

00:26:08.985 --> 00:26:15.885
God, see, many times we lack in fulfilling
our purpose and going, living the way

00:26:15.885 --> 00:26:18.465
that God's called us to, because we
look at our own powers and our own

00:26:18.465 --> 00:26:20.025
abilities, and we say, can't happen.

00:26:20.175 --> 00:26:20.865
Not possible.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.050
In this moment, here's a great picture
that God can use one person, an enemy,

00:26:26.169 --> 00:26:29.350
a disobedient person that had to have a
second time and go through the belly of

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:33.100
a well to get the right choice to go.

00:26:33.429 --> 00:26:37.060
And he used a simple message, delete
600 people to give their lives back

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.350
over to the Lord and to repent.

00:26:38.409 --> 00:26:38.889
Wow.

00:26:39.399 --> 00:26:46.899
If God can do that one step or one act
of obedience today could lead 600,000

00:26:46.899 --> 00:26:50.679
people to faith in Christ could lead
one, could lead life change in your life.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:52.980
I don't know, I have no clue.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.700
And so we, we see that, right.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.440
Obviously it's just like,
how could this happen?

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.680
But the question most of
us have is is this the only

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.180
message that Jonah proclaimed?

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:11.340
And so when I look at my Bible is the
only message that God gives me that he

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.950
said, so we D we can think, man, okay.

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.890
After he said that they all
gathered around the town hall and

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.210
he walked through all these things.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.290
It's not there so we can suppose
some things, but this one

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.720
message shows the power of God.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.350
I believe.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.070
So.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.680
The other question is, and I kind of
mentioned this in the beginning, man.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.410
If I came and preached the message
that Jonah preached would there be

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.690
600,000 people repent each week.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:38.010
And the answer is if that's the
message the Lord gave me and

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.210
that's what the Lord wanted to do.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:44.460
Absolutely see we, we, we, we think we
need to add something to God's word.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:49.700
When God's saying, it's not in your
words, that's the power it's in mind when

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.430
it spoke and Jonah reminds us of them.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.820
So maybe we give Jonah a hard time
for this small message, but maybe

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.120
that is the word that God gave him
to speak so that Jonah couldn't

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.920
get the credit for what happened.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:06.110
So at this point again, we see God
spoke, Jonah listened and responded

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.310
and proclaim the messages that God.

00:28:08.295 --> 00:28:10.035
Totally different from the first response.

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:12.555
And so it seems like maybe
he'd learned his message.

00:28:12.555 --> 00:28:15.825
And again, we haven't got to the end of
the book, so maybe not, but first five

00:28:15.825 --> 00:28:20.385
tells us this when the word or somebody,
not the word, the word, uh, then the

00:28:20.385 --> 00:28:24.165
people of Nineveh believed God, they
proclaimed a fast and dressed in sackcloth

00:28:24.495 --> 00:28:26.295
from the greatest of them to the least.

00:28:26.805 --> 00:28:30.375
And so they believe the message that
Jonah spoke, even though it was simple.

00:28:31.455 --> 00:28:33.795
And so the people of Jonah
were more responsive.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.640
To Jonah's message.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:38.340
Then Jonah was responsive to
God's message the first time.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.580
I think that's an interesting
picture when we think about that.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.280
So let's take a moment to think
through that for a second.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:49.470
Jonah, if we look in today's
terms, Jonah was a church person.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.170
Um, he was religious.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:56.100
He had heard multiple messages
from the Lord and he had

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.450
really full knowledge of God.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.510
Yet we see Jonah ran from the.

00:29:01.695 --> 00:29:03.465
So let's look at the people of Nineveh.

00:29:03.495 --> 00:29:06.105
Who, again, when we think about
today's terms, they were unchurched.

00:29:06.615 --> 00:29:08.805
They'd heard one brief message
from Jonah and they lacked

00:29:08.805 --> 00:29:10.905
knowledge of God out of those two.

00:29:10.905 --> 00:29:13.365
Before you heard everything before,
which one of them should have responded

00:29:13.365 --> 00:29:19.235
to God easier, Jonah, but he didn't.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.660
So so many times we worry as believers.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.690
And if you're a believer in this room,
we were in believers is when we're going

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:29.780
to share the truth of the gospel with
somebody, if they're going to respond.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:36.860
But I think this is a point that says,
Hey, I wonder as believers if we're

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:41.660
going to respond, because it sounds
like John just reminded me of my

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.550
heart is I become numb to the word.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:49.050
And his commands and his word to
go and his word to get up and to

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.400
share the good news with people.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.320
And I, and it just becomes
normal for me to reject.

00:29:54.185 --> 00:29:56.495
And that, that just mean
that just hit me hard.

00:29:56.495 --> 00:29:56.765
Right?

00:29:56.765 --> 00:29:59.015
So we can replace our name with Jonah.

00:29:59.015 --> 00:29:59.285
Right.

00:29:59.285 --> 00:30:02.795
At least some of this might be true
for you that you're in the church that

00:30:02.795 --> 00:30:04.235
you've heard multiple, multiple messages.

00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:05.195
And here's what I do know.

00:30:05.465 --> 00:30:08.405
You guys can't run from that because
you're in a church and I know you've

00:30:08.405 --> 00:30:11.255
at least been here for two messages,
so you can't get out of that one.

00:30:11.255 --> 00:30:11.495
Okay.

00:30:11.495 --> 00:30:14.225
So you may be able to replace yourself
with Jonah in that instance, right?

00:30:14.225 --> 00:30:16.805
Maybe you don't have all the knowledge
that Jonah did, but you have a lot.

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:18.425
So the question is what
went wrong with you?

00:30:19.899 --> 00:30:23.050
Here's what I would say is the
information for Jonah had only gone

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:26.949
to his head the first time it did
not move to his heart or to his feet.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.689
And when I started thinking through
that picture, I'm not a good drawer.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:35.679
And so I'm not drawing this up
here, but I drew a stick man on my

00:30:35.679 --> 00:30:37.929
paper and begin to think about this.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:39.939
How does it work?

00:30:39.969 --> 00:30:43.330
Where we can get things into our head, but
they don't get to our heart or our feet.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:43.659
What happens.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.610
So great example, practical
example Brittany's done in here.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:48.449
So she doesn't hear me.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:54.270
Um, Brittany says, uh, actually
I'm gonna put it this way.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.639
As a, as a husband, I take out
the trash that are chaining.

00:30:56.639 --> 00:30:57.629
Does I just take out the trash?

00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:58.379
That's my role.

00:30:58.379 --> 00:30:59.820
I know I need to take out the trash.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.230
It's driven to me.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.080
It's it's the law in our house.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.699
I take out the trash, right?

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.149
I know this, but it comes to my heart.

00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:12.270
When I recognize all that
my wife does and her knee.

00:31:13.425 --> 00:31:17.534
So when it goes from here, because I
know that's my role and it actually

00:31:17.534 --> 00:31:19.304
hits here because it's a hard thing.

00:31:19.425 --> 00:31:20.594
I want to help my wife out.

00:31:20.745 --> 00:31:21.854
I see all the things she does.

00:31:21.854 --> 00:31:23.054
This is the least I can do.

00:31:23.385 --> 00:31:26.415
It goes to my feet and I go
and I go change the trash.

00:31:26.925 --> 00:31:32.324
What happens when we become, so I'm going
to put this back into the church world.

00:31:32.324 --> 00:31:34.304
What happens when we fill
ourselves with knowledge?

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.250
And we never move it
from here to our heart.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:41.370
We never begin to understand the
true meaning behind the knowledge.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.290
It never hits our feet and we never go.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.889
I don't know if that makes sense
to you, but when I drove this

00:31:46.889 --> 00:31:49.620
little stick figure and wrote these
things out, it made sense to me.

00:31:50.129 --> 00:31:54.090
Then you, you study God's word you,
you pray, you spend time in fellowship

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.100
and you're gaining all this knowledge.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.280
And in the end, you're
gonna love this one guys.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:00.000
We're spiritually.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:02.600
Okay.

00:32:02.929 --> 00:32:03.860
You know what that means?

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:08.629
We're bloated, meaning we just overly
overly filled, but we'd have no real

00:32:08.659 --> 00:32:10.550
way to get I'm going to stop there.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.439
So, right.

00:32:12.439 --> 00:32:16.370
It's, it's these truths that we know,
and we ignore and refuse to obey them

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.110
because they refuse to get to our heart.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:20.270
We refuse to understand the
heart behind God in this.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.360
And so maybe we're like Jonah,
when we think of this as take it

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.700
or leave it, we get the knowledge
and we take it or leave it.

00:32:27.139 --> 00:32:27.530
Right.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.480
But that one of the greatest
challenges I see in this.

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:33.825
As how there are people
waiting on one simple message

00:32:33.825 --> 00:32:36.225
from God and we can give it.

00:32:36.945 --> 00:32:37.995
Jonah just said it.

00:32:38.385 --> 00:32:45.375
We can give one message and to let
600,000 people to turn back to God and

00:32:45.375 --> 00:32:47.295
to ask for forgiveness of their sins.

00:32:48.645 --> 00:32:52.095
There's someone waiting on you on
the other side of your one little

00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:54.555
message that could change their life.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:00.300
That's impactful to me that you guys
and me can all stand up from here today.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:03.150
And maybe it's the conversations we have
after service, or maybe it's when we

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:06.660
walk out to the parking lot, or maybe
it's at our kids' activity later this

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.250
afternoon, or maybe it's at dinner.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.900
There's somebody waiting on you to take
the knowledge that you have, move it

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.560
to your heart and put it in your feet
and go share that message with them.

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:20.340
Maybe it's short, but that
one message is powerful.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:22.260
Does that make sense?

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.430
That one message is powerful.

00:33:24.375 --> 00:33:26.985
And God's called you and
me to be a part of that.

00:33:27.705 --> 00:33:28.605
So, right.

00:33:28.635 --> 00:33:33.195
God gives second chances to Jonah, to
the people who have been of him, because

00:33:33.195 --> 00:33:36.495
obviously he sent Jonah that he could
have just left him there and destroyed

00:33:36.495 --> 00:33:39.915
him, but he didn't, he gave him a second
chance, but ultimately God is giving us a

00:33:39.915 --> 00:33:41.475
second chance for the rest of our lives.

00:33:42.375 --> 00:33:44.085
To fulfill the call that has on us.

00:33:44.264 --> 00:33:47.085
I don't know if you see it in this
versus, but I felt like that we can

00:33:47.085 --> 00:33:49.935
look at these verses and we can take
it and apply it to knowledge, Jonah

00:33:49.935 --> 00:33:52.545
Nineveh and never applied to us.

00:33:52.725 --> 00:33:55.754
But God is speaking through his
word today, directly to you and

00:33:55.754 --> 00:33:58.575
me to say this, he's given you
a second chance to get it right.

00:33:59.355 --> 00:34:02.415
And here's the thing don't go and
fear that you'll fail, because guess

00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:05.955
what you will, at times you will,
but God will pick you up again.

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:07.920
You don't go with that mentality.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.030
You go with it in such a way
that you depend upon God.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.210
He'll give you the words to
speak and the things to do.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:20.370
So if God can change the hearts of 600,000
people who were far far from him, right?

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:22.409
Did those horrible things,
then he can change our hearts.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.760
If God can take Jonah's half
heart of repentance and use

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.510
him to change the eternity of
600,000 people, he can use you.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:33.670
God can use you.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.880
So second Chronicles, seven, 14.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.510
I want to read this.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.280
I want to kinda break down just
a few things and we're going

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.690
to kind of close out here.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:45.210
Send Chronicles seven 14 says
if my people, so it starts with,

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.340
you have to be a person of God.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:54.930
If my people who bear my name,
humble themselves, pray and seek my

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:57.930
face and turn from their evil ways.

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.320
Then I will hear from them and forgive
their sins and heal their life.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.670
Here's what God is saying in this.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:10.190
If you are a part of God's family,
if you've given your life to Jesus

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.520
and you humble yourself, which means
this, it's not about you anymore.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.570
It's about what God desires to do, and
you pray and seek his face, which means

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:21.980
you're seeking him and not yourself and
turn and repent from your evil ways.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.700
Whatever that is, God will hear from you
and forgive you and use you where you are.

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:27.600
Where he has you.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.990
We serve a God who gives second chances.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:32.820
Guys, we need to hear that.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.270
We need to hear that every day we serve
a God that gives us second chances.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.030
He's not an angry God who
just wants something from us.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.640
He's actually a loving God
who wants something for us.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.470
I want to mention a couple
of things he wants for us.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.430
He wants us free from our sins
that so heavily weigh us down.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:48.210
Right?

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.210
The wages of sin is death, but
that's not God's best for us.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:52.890
So he has given us a way out from that.

00:35:53.925 --> 00:35:58.095
Freedom to fulfill our purpose
here on earth with passion

00:35:58.105 --> 00:35:59.925
and joy and life change.

00:36:01.155 --> 00:36:06.075
And the last is he wants a
relationship with you, right?

00:36:06.075 --> 00:36:06.705
He loves you.

00:36:06.705 --> 00:36:08.775
He wants what's best for
you in that relationship.

00:36:09.075 --> 00:36:14.965
So what's stopping you from giving
God all that he has called you

00:36:14.965 --> 00:36:18.115
to give what is stopping you
from experiencing God's second.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:20.070
Chance.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.009
So as we, we have a time of
invitation, I just want to do this.

00:36:23.009 --> 00:36:25.110
I'm going to take, give you guys
a couple moments to reflect.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.110
I want you to just close your eyes
and I want you to just think through

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:33.600
a few things with me, because I want
today to be a day of a next step.

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:38.850
I'm telling you guys, I sat in a
church, two churches last week, and

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:42.150
I'm reminded of the place you sit.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.550
And if you're anything like
me, you probably checked out

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.770
27 times in the middle of my
message, because I did that last.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.890
But what I realized in those moments
is if I don't take a point in the

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:58.960
message and actually reflect and
take a step, they become knowledge

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:00.370
and they never make it to the heart.

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.740
So do me a favor, close
your eyes by your hands.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.140
I'm just going to talk through a few
things for you guys to just consider

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:08.770
in your hearts as you prepare for
what that next step is for God.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:14.010
So this is where you could relate.

00:37:15.029 --> 00:37:18.690
Maybe you're relating with Jonah,
maybe, you know, more about the

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:26.250
word of God than most, you know,
that God has a plan for you, right.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.250
But maybe you become numb to those truths.

00:37:29.879 --> 00:37:32.970
And if that's you, here's
what I know from God's word.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:33.930
It's time to repent.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.940
Do not leave today.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:40.529
Before you ask God to forgive you of
just not living out the knowledge that

00:37:40.529 --> 00:37:42.000
you know, and place it in your home.

00:37:42.915 --> 00:37:43.665
And walking through it.

00:37:43.695 --> 00:37:45.375
God's grace is waiting on you guys.

00:37:45.375 --> 00:37:46.785
God's not as here to condemn you.

00:37:46.785 --> 00:37:50.685
God's here to give you freedom
to be used for his glory.

00:37:52.475 --> 00:37:54.335
So maybe that's not you,
maybe you're not Jonah.

00:37:54.365 --> 00:37:56.255
Maybe you relate more with
the people of Nineveh.

00:37:57.975 --> 00:38:02.174
Maybe you have a current or past sin
that is holding you back, that you

00:38:02.174 --> 00:38:05.835
don't ever feel like you could be
forgiven of or used because of that sin.

00:38:07.154 --> 00:38:09.295
I'm going to just give you
clear truths from God's word.

00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:12.855
It's time for you to see
that you can be forgiven.

00:38:13.215 --> 00:38:18.315
As we saw here in Jonah story, you can be
forgiven and you concern your life to him.

00:38:18.345 --> 00:38:20.655
God's grace is waiting for you as well.

00:38:20.805 --> 00:38:22.155
There's not a person in this room.

00:38:22.155 --> 00:38:25.125
That's not too far from God's grace.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.500
Maybe you're somewhere in the middle.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.250
This is the last group.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:29.850
I just want to address.

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:30.660
Maybe you're somewhere in the middle.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:31.830
Maybe you don't know, relate with Jonah.

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.540
You don't relate with the people
of Nineveh, but you're somewhere

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.030
in the middle, but there's a
next step you need to take.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.290
Maybe it's baptism.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:38.970
Maybe it's sort of surrender to ministry.

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:41.760
Maybe it's just a recommitment to
the Lord because you've fallen away.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.040
Has don't wait until tomorrow.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.470
Ask God what that is that you need to do.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:49.530
I want to challenge you with today.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.910
This, this last thought is after
you ask the Lord during this time

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:58.620
of invitation, what next step you
need to make you tell someone you

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.779
write it down and you set a date.

00:39:01.169 --> 00:39:01.890
I'm gonna say that again.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:07.890
Whatever next step God is asking
you to take you, tell someone, you

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:11.040
write it down and you set a date when
you're going to begin to address it.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.580
That's the only way we'll
begin to overcome these things.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:17.520
That's the only way we'll ever
move knowledge from our heads

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.779
to our hearts, to our feet.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:22.230
And God's calling you to do that
today through the word of Jonah.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.009
The last thing I want to mention
is if you don't know how to

00:39:26.009 --> 00:39:28.650
take that next step, I am here.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:30.779
Brittany is here.

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:32.940
There's so many people
here, but I know I am here.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:37.800
If you have questions, if you don't
know what to do, just talk to me.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:40.710
I want to help you figure out
what it is that God is calling

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:43.860
you to take a next step in it's to
repentance, or maybe it's to faith.

00:39:45.529 --> 00:39:48.259
But I just challenge you not to leave
here today without taking that next step.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.590
Writing it down telling someone and
sending a date when you're going

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.730
to begin to start working on it.

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:56.310
So let's pray, Lord Jesus, God.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:57.000
You're good.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.920
And I know that you're good.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:03.930
And your word says that you have
sent your son Jesus to die on a

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:07.890
cross for our sins, because Lord, we
could not pay for those on our own.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.200
Um, each one of us Lord.

00:40:11.459 --> 00:40:16.740
Um, Lord, you are growing and you
are wanting to grow closer to you.

00:40:17.609 --> 00:40:22.890
And I pray today through your word Lord,
that each one of us does not miss the

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:24.509
opportunity to take that next step.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.890
Lord have faith, or maybe it's the next
step of repentance in the area of sin.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:32.370
But Lord, wherever you call on
each one of us, Lord, I pray that

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:34.080
we do not lack the faith to take.

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:40.290
Lord that we will surrender
these things to you and begin

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.930
living in a way that honors shoe.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.030
And then it's a light to the world.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.770
So Lord, we love you and we
pray this in your holy name.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:50.580
Amen.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:53.610
If you'll stay with us as we worship.
