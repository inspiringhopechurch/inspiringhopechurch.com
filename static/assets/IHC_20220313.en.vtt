00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:06.660
I'm super excited to have all
of our mission teams here.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.050
I've had to kind of share that with a
couple of our members to let them know,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.670
Hey, why do we have so many people?

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.600
I think our mission team outnumbers
our current people here today.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.750
Um, and this is what I was trying
to share with them is this is how a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.670
church starts is the church from all.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.630
Comes and helps build churches, right.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.680
Help start churches.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.820
Um, and it's just this idea of, we
wouldn't be here as inspiring hope without

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.000
partner churches, just like you, who
financially support us, who send mission

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.770
teams, uh, for BCMs and things like that
to come and help us serve our city, to

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.760
be able to engage people and to love on
them and show them the love of Christ.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.920
And so you guys get to be the
hands and feet of Jesus as we

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.090
continue to grow as a church.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.680
And one day here's the cool part.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.790
This is what I was sharing earlier, when.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:49.669
We'll become the church.

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:51.290
That's sending people out to go serve.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.709
Right.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.529
Um, we won't actually be having
you guys come in and serve us.

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:55.550
We'll get to turn and do that.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.589
So you guys are a part
of something really cool.

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:59.660
Um, I think I was talking
to a youth group last night.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.890
I think it was Thompson station.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.849
Their youth group is probably larger
than this church service today.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.640
Um, and so their pricing, their
thing, and this is a pretty small

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.310
church and the truth is yes.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.880
Um, but it all, every church and even
Thompson, station's got a cool story.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.340
Every church started somewhere right.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.670
With one.

00:01:17.365 --> 00:01:21.055
Couple of families saying, man, we
sense God's moving in our lives and that

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:22.885
becomes something amazing in the city.

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:26.965
And so I want to share with you guys first
off, um, a little bit about who we are

00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:29.485
as a church, and then I'm gonna kind of
jump into the text and catch everybody up.

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:32.335
But we are a church that
believes this here's our mission.

00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:33.355
We designed.

00:01:34.185 --> 00:01:37.845
To inspire hope by helping people
discover God's purpose for the life

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:39.015
through relationship with Jesus.

00:01:39.255 --> 00:01:44.025
We really believe that every single
person has a divine purpose from God.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.695
And they'll only discover that
through relationship with Jesus.

00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:51.345
And so every week we come in and we talk
about God's word, we inspire and encourage

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:55.355
each other to know God more and more so
that we can go and inspire others to know.

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.970
More and more, um, we, we choose
to do that through four things.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.840
We really believe as a church, as we
follow Jesus as we live in community,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.660
as we serve those around us, that
we'll ultimately see God's kingdom

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.610
expanded, not only here locally in
our city, but also around the world.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.940
And it's really cool how God has
continued to do that in our church.

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.020
Um, and I'm excited about today's
message and the way that we'll be

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.220
able to grow in God's word today.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.570
So if you have a copy of God's word, we're
going to be in first Timothy chapter two.

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:29.144
First Timothy chapter two, we're
going to be in verse eight.

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:34.035
And, um, I said this to a couple of teams
last night, but I'll say it again today.

00:02:34.035 --> 00:02:38.415
There's going to be some times I ask
questions that I really do want answers.

00:02:38.655 --> 00:02:41.775
So if you're like, Hey, that's
just like a Ritter rhetorical.

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:42.765
Um, no, seriously.

00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:46.695
I want you to answer those questions as
I ask them, because I love to be able to

00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:48.584
hear your perspective on a few things.

00:02:48.915 --> 00:02:51.465
So this is the first
question that I want to ask.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.690
How many evolve, but then distracted by
something or someone in your life you've

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.300
been distracted by something or someone,
somebody give me a couple of examples

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.010
of how you've been distracted before.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.380
What phone?

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.830
Yes.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.030
A great cell phone.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.450
Yes.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.440
School, video games, careers.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.800
Yeah, kids.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.150
There's a great one.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.960
Yes.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.930
You know, one of the things
that I typically get annoyed by.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.140
Penn clickers aim.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.550
Anybody got pen clicker in class.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.110
I mean, we're sitting here trying
to study for a test or take a

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.040
test and this is what happens.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.400
Okay.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.530
So if you've got a pen today,
please don't be a pink clicker.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.230
Um, so the reason why I asked that
question is I think many of us can

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.890
probably give examples of where we've
been distracted by someone or something.

00:03:42.075 --> 00:03:45.375
Or we have been the one that
distracts someone from something.

00:03:45.584 --> 00:03:48.795
If you probably are in dorms with another
friend, there's probably another friend

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:51.674
that's trying to get their homework done
and you're talking their ear off, or

00:03:51.674 --> 00:03:53.024
you're on the phone with your boyfriend.

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:53.385
Right.

00:03:53.714 --> 00:03:55.695
And you're annoying them for
getting their homework done.

00:03:56.114 --> 00:03:57.825
But today we're going to
actually jump into a text.

00:03:57.825 --> 00:03:59.804
And I want to kind of catch you
guys up on this as this idea

00:03:59.804 --> 00:04:01.845
behind being distracted from the.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.800
Being distracted from the mission.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.530
I think as believers is easy and the
world that we live in to be distracted by

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.220
everything else and avoid fulfilling the
mission that God's called us to fulfill.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.670
And most of us don't start off
with the intention to do that.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.899
Most of us have great intentions
to fulfill again, the call that God

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:26.670
has on our life to make a difference
in the world, but we slowly.

00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:30.195
Get distracted by small
things and big things.

00:04:30.195 --> 00:04:34.365
And the next thing we know is we
are fulfilling our own desires and

00:04:34.365 --> 00:04:36.105
not the desires that God has for us.

00:04:36.105 --> 00:04:39.405
And so, um, before we jump into this
text, I want to catch everybody up

00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:40.515
since everybody hasn't been here.

00:04:40.515 --> 00:04:44.565
So we've been walking through the
first book of Timothy Timothy,

00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:48.525
um, is, uh, basically a, a
true son in the faith of Paul.

00:04:48.525 --> 00:04:51.765
So if you know the apostle Paul, he's the
one that wrote the book of first Timothy.

00:04:51.975 --> 00:04:53.805
He was actually in prison
when he was writing this.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.180
Um, and so he's writing to Timothy,
his dear son in the faith who is

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.880
a pastor at the church of Ephesus.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.909
See, the one thing that I love
about Timothy is the more you get

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:06.260
to know Timothy, he was timid.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.230
He was not as competent in his faith.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.680
He was a little bit.

00:05:10.335 --> 00:05:11.085
And his faith.

00:05:11.534 --> 00:05:14.715
Um, and so one of the things that Paul
said is you need to stay an emphasis

00:05:14.744 --> 00:05:18.554
and address the false teachers that
are there teaching incorrectly.

00:05:19.065 --> 00:05:20.625
So he's challenging Timothy to stay.

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:24.465
But so the first part of the first
chapter of Timothy is as he's challenging

00:05:24.465 --> 00:05:26.895
him to stay and address these false
teachers, here's what he says.

00:05:27.224 --> 00:05:30.825
He says, Timothy, I want you to address
these false teachers with love and truth.

00:05:31.755 --> 00:05:32.354
Love and truth.

00:05:32.354 --> 00:05:35.685
Well, the question we ended up asking
this question is why and love and

00:05:35.685 --> 00:05:39.854
truth, because we realized that
these false teachers were stirring

00:05:39.854 --> 00:05:41.625
up controversy in the church.

00:05:41.895 --> 00:05:43.635
They were stirring up anger and disputes.

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.195
And we're going to see a
little bit more of that today.

00:05:45.525 --> 00:05:48.525
And so what Paul said was you
need to address it with the

00:05:48.525 --> 00:05:50.174
opposite, which has God's love.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.500
But it needs to be truth.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.700
So as Paul began to share that with
Timothy, he also said, now, I also want

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.540
you to share with these false teachers
and your church that anyone can be saved.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.230
This is where Paul's testimony is
shared at the end of chapter one.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.240
Whereas Paul's life was so changed.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.350
Paul said, this God saved me so that
everyone could know they could be saved.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.300
It didn't matter how bad someone was.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.140
Paul could say I was the worst
of sinners and anyone can be.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.180
Then one of the things that Paul shared,
uh, in first Timothy is about Timothy

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.990
remembering his call and how his call
was going to be powerful for Timothy

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.860
to have the confidence, to be able to
address these false teachers and to be

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.640
able to continue to fulfill the call
on his life as a pastor of emphasis.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.670
But then we jumped into chapter
two, a couple of weeks ago, and

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.360
chapter two said this, first of all,
pray, that was Paul's statement.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.690
And first of all, praying, and
when we heard that we realized

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.100
this, that everything we do.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.860
As a follower of Christ should start
with prayer because prayer is powerful.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.420
He says, pray for everyone.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.290
And especially those in authority,
especially those in authority,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.780
because he want, he said, we
want to live peaceable lives.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.010
Ones that make a difference in the
lives of those around us, so that we can

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.600
live our liberal lifestyle for Christ.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.880
And then he says this and
we covered this last week.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.630
He says that prayer is good, which
we translate it to be beautiful.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.250
And it pleases God.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.099
Who desires all to come to faith in
Christ and that's verse four of chapter

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:21.990
two, all to come to faith in Christ.

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:26.280
And then he begins to share who
Christ is and why Christ came and how

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.870
he saves everyone from their sins.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.130
He took their place.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.480
And Paul said, I have fulfilled my call
as a Herald and a teacher in an apostle.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.210
To be able to share this
truth with other people.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.539
So we're jumping into this text and I
want you guys to hear all those, that

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:43.500
background because we have to deal
with today's text within the context,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.849
which wastes basically means this.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.349
We have to view the next few
verses in light of what we know.

00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:53.219
Paul is writing a letter to Timothy
to address false teaching things that

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:56.489
are disrupting the church service,
disrupting the church leadership

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.599
and the direction of the truth.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.669
And that's going to be critical
as we read this text today.

00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:04.090
And as we jump in and so we're
going to learn today, uh, how we

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.260
get distracted from the mission and
how we need to avoid distracting

00:08:08.289 --> 00:08:10.179
others from that mission as well.

00:08:10.179 --> 00:08:14.770
So first Timothy chapter one, or
somebody's chapter two, verse a.

00:08:15.549 --> 00:08:19.030
If everybody found it, say,
amen, all right, let's jump in.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.859
It says this in verse eight, it says.

00:08:22.275 --> 00:08:26.925
I want men and every place to
pray, lifting up holy hands

00:08:27.075 --> 00:08:28.905
without anger or argument.

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:34.455
Also, the women are to dress themselves
in modest clothing with decency and good

00:08:34.455 --> 00:08:39.075
sense, not with elaborate hairstyles
or gold or pearls or excessive

00:08:39.075 --> 00:08:43.845
apparel, but with good works, which is
proper for women who profess worship.

00:08:45.315 --> 00:08:47.775
A woman is to learn quietly
with full submission.

00:08:47.835 --> 00:08:51.015
I do not allow women to teach
or to have authority over a man.

00:08:51.315 --> 00:08:55.935
Instead she is to remain quiet for
Adam was formed first, then Eve and

00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:59.625
Adam was not deceived, but the woman
was deceived and transgressed, but

00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:04.065
she will be saved through childbearing
if she, or if they continue in faith,

00:09:04.095 --> 00:09:06.555
love, holiness, and good sense.

00:09:07.095 --> 00:09:09.045
So let's pray and invite God in.

00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:12.075
As we begin to walk through
this text, Lord Jesus.

00:09:12.075 --> 00:09:12.825
We are so thankful.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.000
Lord for you because we know that
Lord, you have a plan and a place

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.170
for each person in this room.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.090
Lord, a plan for each one of us to fulfill
our call on this side of heaven, to be

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.840
able to help others discover hope in
Jesus, to be able to be transformed in

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.030
our lives, to be able to help our lives.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.410
Lord look like.

00:09:32.485 --> 00:09:35.155
And so Lord, I pray today as we
jump into this text and as we

00:09:35.155 --> 00:09:38.425
begin to study your word, Lord,
I pray that our hearts are open.

00:09:38.605 --> 00:09:39.535
Our minds are open.

00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:43.645
Our ears are open to be changed,
Lord, to learn how the distractions

00:09:43.645 --> 00:09:48.204
of the world need to be avoided,
that we need to focus on you.

00:09:48.204 --> 00:09:51.444
Lord, we need to prioritize Lord
what you want us to prioritize, to

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:53.125
allow the mission to move forward.

00:09:53.905 --> 00:09:55.974
So Lord, give me wisdom in order to share.

00:09:56.425 --> 00:09:58.435
And, uh, Lord, we love you and
we pray this in your hands.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:09:59.820
Amen.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.480
Amen.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.670
And my notes fill in prayer.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:04.860
So.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.760
The first group that we see here
that was being a distraction

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.930
in the church was the men.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.850
And I want to kind of start off this way.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.790
I really believe that Paul is directly
speaking to the men throughout this

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.810
whole text, but he's speaking to the men
first because these men were interesting.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.790
And when we're talking about these
false teachers, that Timothy is

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.700
supposed to address these aren't false
teachers that are outside the church,

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.650
they're actually inside this church.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.850
So imagine this.

00:10:27.454 --> 00:10:31.175
That we would today have teachers
or people within this group

00:10:31.204 --> 00:10:34.655
right now that would be causing
controversy in the church.

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:37.834
And some of you may be a part
of a church that has that, but

00:10:37.864 --> 00:10:39.454
in Paul's day, he did have that.

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:44.584
So when we look at this first group,
he says here, again, got to move back.

00:10:44.584 --> 00:10:48.185
My Patriots is therefore I want men
in every place to pray, lifting up

00:10:48.185 --> 00:10:50.584
holy hands without anger or argument.

00:10:51.449 --> 00:10:54.810
So he uses this word, therefore,
and most of us asked this question

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.990
when he says, therefore, what's
it therefore is dealing with.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.870
He says, therefore, since I just
got done telling you the F in the

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.410
last eight verses or seven verses
that you need to pray first.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.280
And that God's desire is that
everyone comes to faith in Christ.

00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:11.069
You need to eliminate these distractions.

00:11:11.069 --> 00:11:16.680
You need to address these men who have
been angry and causing arguments and the.

00:11:18.104 --> 00:11:22.005
And so here's what he said, men and
every place should pray, because again,

00:11:22.005 --> 00:11:25.935
Paul's saying prayer is powerful, but
he makes this statement with holy hands.

00:11:26.295 --> 00:11:29.805
And when you begin to look at holy
hands, you think about hands are holding.

00:11:29.805 --> 00:11:32.025
If you think about the word,
holy is to be set apart.

00:11:32.474 --> 00:11:35.115
I started thinking about holy hands
and I think about clean hands.

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:36.974
So here's what Paul's not saying.

00:11:37.214 --> 00:11:38.834
Hey, before you pray, men, make sure you.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.330
Wash your hands, put some of that germ X
on there, then lift them up and go before

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.170
God know what Paul is saying is these
men need to get their hearts, right?

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.310
Because what's happening is they're
causing anger and argument in the church.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:56.630
And many of them are coming
before God in prayer without being

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.730
pure in their heart, which means
they're not coming to the Lord.

00:11:59.805 --> 00:12:02.835
With repentant heart, they're
coming to the Lord with anger

00:12:03.135 --> 00:12:04.455
and frustration in their heart.

00:12:04.845 --> 00:12:09.945
And so what Paul's first challenge is, is
he wants men not to just pray, but to pray

00:12:09.945 --> 00:12:16.425
with a undefiled heart, a heart free of
sin, one who comes humbly before the Lord.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.310
I think he's uses this word
without anger or argument.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.220
And so we can get that assumption as
we begin to look into this text that

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:28.800
these men were probably creating some
arguments and some anger over, um, what

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.410
they were talking about in church and
what they were discussing in the church.

00:12:31.994 --> 00:12:35.685
And so we realized that in this ad is
speaking to a specific group and emphasis,

00:12:35.685 --> 00:12:39.824
and this is why I say context matters
when we look at this, yes, every man

00:12:39.824 --> 00:12:43.785
should probably pray in church with a
repentant heart, with their hands, hold

00:12:43.785 --> 00:12:48.915
hell high, but only believe that Paul is
directly talking to this group because

00:12:48.915 --> 00:12:52.694
this group was causing dissension in
the church because they were causing

00:12:52.724 --> 00:12:54.525
anger and frustration in the church.

00:12:54.854 --> 00:12:58.155
So his challenge was to this minute
and emphasis, pray with a pure heart.

00:12:59.324 --> 00:13:01.064
And so I want to challenge
you in this thought.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.260
If you're sitting here saying,
oh man, I love written.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.280
You may be a lot like me.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.420
We read scripture and we see somebody
that God's getting onto and we go,

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.040
man, I'm glad I'm not like them.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.010
Well, usually when I start
having that type of a heart,

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.090
man, I'm glad I'm not like them.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.060
God convicts me and realizes
I'm more like them than I think.

00:13:18.885 --> 00:13:21.074
So here's, I think the piece of
you're sitting here saying, Hey,

00:13:21.074 --> 00:13:24.915
I don't struggle, uh, with causing
arguments and decision in the church.

00:13:24.944 --> 00:13:26.685
So I guess I don't need
to pray with holy hands.

00:13:26.895 --> 00:13:27.824
I'm not a man.

00:13:27.885 --> 00:13:29.145
I don't need to pray with whole hands.

00:13:29.295 --> 00:13:32.954
I believe what Paul's even speaking
to us today is we shouldn't go before

00:13:32.954 --> 00:13:36.224
the Lord in prayer without a repentant
heart, without a heart, right.

00:13:36.344 --> 00:13:36.675
With God.

00:13:37.665 --> 00:13:38.655
Which is so important.

00:13:38.655 --> 00:13:40.665
I think part of prayer is repentance.

00:13:41.055 --> 00:13:43.485
And so a lot of times when we talk
about prayers, maybe we should

00:13:43.485 --> 00:13:44.775
go before God, before we ask.

00:13:44.955 --> 00:13:48.345
And when, before we talk to him is to
come with him with that attitude of Lord.

00:13:48.345 --> 00:13:49.875
If there's anything in
my heart that is wrong.

00:13:49.905 --> 00:13:50.805
Let me go address it.

00:13:50.805 --> 00:13:52.485
You hear this a lot before you give an.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.000
If you were having a wrong against
a brother, you were to leave the

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.050
offering at the altar and go deal with
that, that unrepentant sin, before

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:04.010
you go in and offer that offering,
this is the same thing that Paul is

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:08.720
challenging men in the church to deal
with, but he's also challenging us.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.470
And he's challenging these men to do
this specifically because they were

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.569
causing a distraction from the mission.

00:14:15.675 --> 00:14:19.064
That Paul was challenging Timothy
to remind the church, to fulfill

00:14:19.064 --> 00:14:22.694
again, to see everyone come to
faith in Christ, that that God would

00:14:22.694 --> 00:14:24.314
allow to come to faith in Christ.

00:14:24.314 --> 00:14:26.025
And so these men were
sitting in a bad example.

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:27.525
So let me ask this question.

00:14:27.944 --> 00:14:30.405
Anybody ever been in a church where
you've dealt with a little bit of church

00:14:30.405 --> 00:14:33.435
controversial, you have somebody that's
kind of causing disruption in the church.

00:14:34.425 --> 00:14:36.314
There's a decent amount of people that do.

00:14:36.314 --> 00:14:38.475
So you're slightly raising
your hand because you don't

00:14:38.475 --> 00:14:39.405
maybe want to admit that.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.420
Church is full of people that are broken.

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:45.150
And so all of us in this
room have some problems.

00:14:45.359 --> 00:14:47.400
So we're going to deal with
that from time to time.

00:14:47.729 --> 00:14:51.150
And so this isn't shocking to know
that there are some, some issues in

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.810
the church, but when you, when you
think back to those people who were

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:59.040
causing those issues, didn't seem to
distract the church from the mission.

00:14:59.219 --> 00:15:03.060
They began to focus more on dealing with
the person and the inward fighting than

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.650
they were dealing with reaching the law.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.680
I don't know about you guys, but I
think that's exactly where Paul's

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.700
getting at is these things were
causing distractions from the mission

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.260
that God had called them to fulfill.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.420
So the question is, what is the mission?

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:20.370
Again, the mission we had to go back to
God is pleased by us praying, but then

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:24.960
he says, God is also pleased because he
desires that all come to faith in him.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.190
So the mission is that every person
that we come in contact with, we get

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.460
the opportunity to share the gospel
with and share the love of Christ with.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.195
But if we're busy, With
all the infighting, the

00:15:36.195 --> 00:15:38.475
arguing will never do that.

00:15:39.825 --> 00:15:41.625
So let me ask this question.

00:15:42.615 --> 00:15:45.105
What are some ways that
you tend to get distracted?

00:15:45.105 --> 00:15:46.995
And they may be very similar to
what we talked about earlier, but

00:15:46.995 --> 00:15:50.235
what are some ways that you get
distracted from fulfilling the mission

00:15:50.235 --> 00:15:51.335
that God's called you to fulfill?

00:15:51.355 --> 00:15:52.765
What are some things that
happened in your life?

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:56.445
That's so busy in your life that
caused you to even be distracted

00:15:56.445 --> 00:15:58.455
from fulfilling the mission that
God's called you to fulfill?

00:16:04.075 --> 00:16:04.855
Extracurriculars.

00:16:04.855 --> 00:16:05.095
Right.

00:16:05.095 --> 00:16:07.015
So your hobbies right now, that's good.

00:16:07.045 --> 00:16:07.705
What else?

00:16:11.585 --> 00:16:12.905
Your job can do that, right?

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:16.055
You can be so consumed by your
job that you even don't even

00:16:16.055 --> 00:16:17.285
think about the mission of God.

00:16:17.315 --> 00:16:17.915
What else?

00:16:19.535 --> 00:16:19.835
Yes.

00:16:19.835 --> 00:16:20.555
People's opinions.

00:16:20.555 --> 00:16:22.625
So you care more about
what they think of you.

00:16:22.985 --> 00:16:25.625
So then you don't go fulfill the
mission that God's called you to.

00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:26.135
That's great.

00:16:26.135 --> 00:16:26.765
One more.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.500
Social media.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.069
Yes.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.660
Your cell phone in general, right?

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.890
Social media is a great one.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.410
When we think about that, these
are all things that distract

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.640
us from fulfilling the mission.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.720
Here's another one I want to challenge
you in this, to be honest, this is maybe

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.470
where I don't get any answers, but I hope
that the Lord puts some in your heart.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:44.340
If that is true.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.300
What are some ways that you think you
might distract others from fulfilling?

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:48.750
The mission?

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.150
Got a lot quieter talk too much.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.470
Yes, that's good.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:56.680
Thank you.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.010
What?

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.000
Yes.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.600
You talk too much.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.370
So you're the person our
we're calling her out

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.349
your opinions.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.579
Yes, absolutely.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:09.540
What else?

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:09.960
One more thing.

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:15.770
It's all right.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:16.970
You know, they give it one more thing.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.340
I challenge you in this, this thing again.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.270
Um, I think, and I'll give you just
a quick example before we move on.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.470
Um, we had a youth service last week
and, um, during worship again, I love

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:31.970
love youth, but I totally get, we, we
get distracted at times we're worshiping

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.080
and there's two students there.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.680
And the older student is kind of
poking on the little students.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.170
Talking to him about his shoes and
Robert in the middle of worship.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.130
And I'm kind of this thing.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.030
I understand kids.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.430
I just, I do, but it just kept going on.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.760
And finally, after we, we go and we
have a, a time of, of discussing.

00:17:48.825 --> 00:17:52.034
And I just asked this per actually
asked the group that I was talking

00:17:52.034 --> 00:17:54.794
to after I said, Hey dude, don't
you guys hate being distracted?

00:17:54.794 --> 00:17:55.845
They're like, absolutely.

00:17:55.845 --> 00:17:57.725
I'm like, what, what are
some things that happened?

00:17:57.745 --> 00:17:58.905
You have your siblings distracted.

00:17:58.905 --> 00:17:59.085
Yeah.

00:17:59.085 --> 00:18:00.284
They distract me from video games.

00:18:00.284 --> 00:18:02.445
I hate when they do that,
so-and-so distraction from this.

00:18:02.445 --> 00:18:03.284
I said, great.

00:18:03.675 --> 00:18:05.145
I said, do you realize
you were just distracting?

00:18:05.145 --> 00:18:07.784
So-and-so whenever they were
trying to worship in their life.

00:18:07.845 --> 00:18:09.885
Oh, and I said, here's the thing.

00:18:09.885 --> 00:18:13.155
It was a lot of times we're good
at pointing out what other people.

00:18:13.965 --> 00:18:14.265
Right.

00:18:14.265 --> 00:18:15.885
So we're sitting in the
church and we want to go, man.

00:18:15.885 --> 00:18:17.895
So-and-so is distracting me from this.

00:18:17.895 --> 00:18:20.895
And so-and-so tra well, we don't even
look internally and realize that we're

00:18:20.895 --> 00:18:24.585
the ones going around by the way that
we act, by the way that we talk, by

00:18:24.585 --> 00:18:29.925
the way that we act one way at church
and another way outside the church.

00:18:30.555 --> 00:18:32.475
And that person is looking
to choose an example.

00:18:33.285 --> 00:18:35.685
And that's just the challenge here
to say, oh man, that's convicting.

00:18:36.375 --> 00:18:37.725
Even as a pastor, right?

00:18:37.815 --> 00:18:40.305
You may see me up here on Sunday, but
then you may talk to me on Monday and

00:18:40.305 --> 00:18:41.535
go, man, you look a little bit different.

00:18:41.535 --> 00:18:42.345
You act a little bit different.

00:18:42.345 --> 00:18:46.755
So I'm even asking myself this question,
what am I doing that is distracting

00:18:46.755 --> 00:18:50.595
people for fulfilling their call in their
life to be a part of the mission of God.

00:18:51.315 --> 00:18:52.575
So those are some tough statements.

00:18:52.785 --> 00:18:56.235
You guys won't leave here today without
being challenged, but I'll tell you this

00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:59.655
every week that I preach, I challenged
myself at home to deal with this as well.

00:18:59.865 --> 00:19:01.245
So I'm not just talking to you.

00:19:01.245 --> 00:19:02.235
I'm literally talking to myself.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.230
As well in this.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.970
So let's look at the second group
that it was being a distraction in

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.260
the church, and this is the women
in the way that they were dressing.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.870
And I always love so they're
picking on the women, but men,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.380
just so you know, I think we could
start working the men into this.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:21.180
Cause sometimes we dress a little bit
weird and a little bit distracting and

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.130
we'll, we'll get it to the heart of this.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:23.760
And just a minute.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.760
So when we look at this in verse
nine, he says also the women.

00:19:27.975 --> 00:19:30.915
To dress themselves in modest
closing with decency and good sense

00:19:31.125 --> 00:19:34.545
now with elaborate hairstyles,
gold pearls or excessive apparel.

00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:36.195
And I'll read verse 10 in just a minute.

00:19:37.065 --> 00:19:39.705
So Paul was not just dealing with man.

00:19:39.705 --> 00:19:40.965
He was not just dealing with women.

00:19:40.965 --> 00:19:41.445
He was actually.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.620
Both all of us.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.870
So we can't really point
fingers at one or the other.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.460
We actually are all included in this.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.870
And so he's addressing women who are more
focused on their outward appearance, then

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.290
their inward condition, their outward
appearance and their human condition.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.389
I don't believe Paul's biggest issue.

00:19:57.389 --> 00:20:00.720
Was there our condition more
than it was that they probably

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.340
spent hours and hours and hours.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.260
And you all know that
happens on Sunday morning.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.260
Sometimes you spend two
hours getting yourself ready.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.480
But you never spend time praying.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.820
You never spend time asking the
Lord what he's going to teach you.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.190
And you've probably spent more
time coming in and talking about

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.170
where you got your hair done and
where you bought your dress from.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.280
All I'm saying is these are the
distractions that Paul was speaking to

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.110
even back in the church of emphasis.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.110
So it's been happening for a while
and he's, uh, he's dealing with

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:30.540
this in this idea that it was a
distraction, not only from them

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.400
personally, but those around them.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.330
So I want to ask this.

00:20:34.395 --> 00:20:35.925
Imagine the church of Ephesus.

00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:39.585
These ladies coming in, get all these
crazy hairstyles, all these crazy

00:20:39.585 --> 00:20:43.785
dress, everything walking into the
church during the church service.

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:46.455
What do you thinks were some of
the distractions in the middle

00:20:46.455 --> 00:20:49.275
of church service because of the
way that these women are dressed?

00:20:49.305 --> 00:20:50.895
What do you think were
some of the distractions?

00:20:56.525 --> 00:20:57.035
Anybody?

00:20:58.504 --> 00:20:58.685
Huh?

00:20:59.745 --> 00:21:00.345
NV.

00:21:00.345 --> 00:21:01.365
That's a great one.

00:21:01.395 --> 00:21:01.605
Okay.

00:21:01.605 --> 00:21:05.895
Let's let's think through this number
one, there's probably women in this group

00:21:05.925 --> 00:21:07.725
that couldn't even purchase that stuff.

00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:11.715
So the one they're watching and they're
judging, but then they're also envious.

00:21:11.774 --> 00:21:13.754
They're like, man, I wish I
could have that hairstyle.

00:21:13.754 --> 00:21:15.585
And man, I wish I could have that dress.

00:21:15.585 --> 00:21:19.605
And the pastor's up there preaching
the gospel, trying to challenge

00:21:19.605 --> 00:21:22.544
them to go share their faith and
all that person can think of is man.

00:21:23.024 --> 00:21:23.955
I'm just, I don't know.

00:21:23.955 --> 00:21:26.294
So let let's, let's go on to
another, what's another distraction

00:21:26.294 --> 00:21:26.845
that could have happened in.

00:21:28.825 --> 00:21:29.515
Lust.

00:21:29.785 --> 00:21:30.475
That's a great one.

00:21:31.285 --> 00:21:35.575
And I say a great one, not in a good
way, but man, you know this, okay.

00:21:35.575 --> 00:21:36.805
We all could be real in here.

00:21:36.805 --> 00:21:37.885
We're family, right?

00:21:38.575 --> 00:21:42.745
A lady walks in this church guarantee or
down the road because we are talking about

00:21:42.745 --> 00:21:44.515
just in a regular day lives dressing.

00:21:44.515 --> 00:21:49.315
All fancy guys are typically going
to turn their head in church service.

00:21:49.315 --> 00:21:50.425
They're going to be distracted.

00:21:50.545 --> 00:21:52.195
And you may say, oh, I'm a Christian.

00:21:52.195 --> 00:21:53.125
I've got this.

00:21:53.995 --> 00:21:54.445
Yes.

00:21:54.475 --> 00:21:55.315
But sometimes men.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.100
Can't write it's it's that distracting?

00:21:59.129 --> 00:22:04.740
So was Paul saying, Hey, beauty is
great, but we're, we're wanting to

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.150
focus on Christ in our services.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.910
We're wanting to focus on Christ
in our lives, and we need to put

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.670
things into our life that doesn't
distract us from those things.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.280
And so that's a distraction,
obviously from the men standpoint.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.879
So men and women obviously would
spend more time looking at these

00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:20.879
women than paying attention at
church envy and jealousy was one

00:22:20.879 --> 00:22:21.870
of those that you guys mentioned.

00:22:22.875 --> 00:22:24.615
But these women spent again, more time.

00:22:24.615 --> 00:22:25.395
I think we're even looking at this.

00:22:25.395 --> 00:22:27.825
This is an inward condition that
he's addressing these women's

00:22:27.825 --> 00:22:30.735
spent more time on their outward
appearance and their inward heart.

00:22:30.765 --> 00:22:32.655
They treated the church
like a fashion show.

00:22:33.405 --> 00:22:36.705
And so you say, oh man, Paul's
really being mean to women.

00:22:37.005 --> 00:22:38.115
No, actually he's not.

00:22:38.115 --> 00:22:42.045
I don't even believe he's even saying
he's forbidding the use of these things.

00:22:43.125 --> 00:22:47.445
What he's really trying to deal with
is that we tend to substitute our

00:22:47.445 --> 00:22:50.985
outward appearance for an inward.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.090
Condition of the heart.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.250
So let me just say this.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:01.320
If you come to church, even though you're
not dressed all nice and you put on a

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.910
front as though everything is okay, and
that life's great and you pay all your

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.980
bills and you never struggle with sin.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:13.200
It's the same thing because you become a
distraction because if you bring all those

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.310
things up as though life's perfect and
you start telling somebody what happens.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.260
'cause people start thinking,
man, I wish I had that life.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.780
I wish I had that marriage
cause they never fight.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:27.070
At least they never tell me they fight
when the truth is, we all know we have

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.850
arguments in our home and the truth is we
know we have kids that don't always do.

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:31.270
What's right.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.960
And kids, you know, parents are always
perfect either, but you tend to tell

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.240
your friends that because you don't
want your friends to think that your

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:43.600
parents are weird, even though they are,
what, what am I getting out of here?

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.500
What is Paul getting out here?

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:52.440
Paul saying, be real and focus on coming
to church and being around other believers

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.480
with having a outward appearance.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.180
And this is where we're talking about
this outward appearance is so important.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.960
What Paul is talking
here, um, in verse 10.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.300
So let's look at this verse 10
and he can kind of set us up here.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:08.460
He says this, he says don't wear all these
things, but with good works as is proper

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.140
for women who profess worship together.

00:24:11.355 --> 00:24:15.225
So here's what Paul's saying, ladies,
rather than distract people by what you

00:24:15.225 --> 00:24:19.395
wear, why don't you live, act and dress
in a way that will point people to Jesus.

00:24:20.685 --> 00:24:23.085
And again, he's speaking to
women to this day, I want to

00:24:23.085 --> 00:24:24.765
speak to men and women in this.

00:24:25.485 --> 00:24:30.045
We should live act and dress in such
a way that point people to Jesus,

00:24:30.075 --> 00:24:32.415
not distract people from Jesus.

00:24:33.315 --> 00:24:34.935
And that's really where Paul's.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.490
Rather than drawn attention to
your closing, which causes people

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:39.990
to NBN less than admire you.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:46.050
Why don't you draw people to Jesus by
your good works, which he says is what

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:48.120
professing women who follow Jesus.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.340
Do I don't know about you guys.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.340
This is where I go back to the,
the second, uh, chapter of, of,

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.830
of Timothy here, where he says.

00:24:56.625 --> 00:25:01.605
That prayer, pleases God, and that
God desires for everyone to be saved.

00:25:01.905 --> 00:25:04.785
I listen up whenever I hear
something says it pleases God.

00:25:04.965 --> 00:25:08.445
So when I ask this question, how many in
here want to please God with their lives,

00:25:10.335 --> 00:25:15.555
then today's truth should not be something
that is like, you feel attacked today

00:25:15.555 --> 00:25:18.855
should be like, oh man, this is another
way to please God, by the way, in which I

00:25:18.855 --> 00:25:21.015
dress, by the way, in which I distracted.

00:25:21.735 --> 00:25:23.625
I need to eliminate
those things for my life.

00:25:23.625 --> 00:25:25.695
And I need to start
pointing people to Jesus.

00:25:25.965 --> 00:25:28.574
When you look at these things through
the heart and the lens of wanting

00:25:28.574 --> 00:25:32.385
to please God, and knowing that he
will help others know him as well.

00:25:32.385 --> 00:25:35.084
So Paul's addressing a heart
issue with these women.

00:25:37.095 --> 00:25:37.754
To deal with this.

00:25:37.754 --> 00:25:40.995
And so that's the, that's the second group
we talk about here, but then there's a

00:25:40.995 --> 00:25:43.455
third group that was being a distraction.

00:25:43.455 --> 00:25:45.375
And we're going to have to look at
this again, at context, I'm gonna

00:25:45.375 --> 00:25:46.635
try to pull this all together here.

00:25:46.935 --> 00:25:50.175
This third group was women
who were disrupting services

00:25:50.175 --> 00:25:51.495
and disrespecting leadership.

00:25:51.524 --> 00:25:53.745
And so you're maybe asking
the same question that I asked

00:25:53.745 --> 00:25:54.794
as I began to look into this.

00:25:54.975 --> 00:25:56.175
Where do you see that?

00:25:56.475 --> 00:25:57.885
So let's read these next couple of verses.

00:25:57.885 --> 00:25:59.804
He says a woman is to
learn quietly with full.

00:26:01.225 --> 00:26:04.345
And he says, I do not allow women to
teach or have authority over a man.

00:26:04.645 --> 00:26:06.264
Instead she is to remain quiet.

00:26:06.264 --> 00:26:07.135
I'm going to stop right there.

00:26:07.135 --> 00:26:11.064
Number one, if you go and read this
verse out of context, you're really

00:26:11.064 --> 00:26:13.284
gonna feel like Paul is bashing women.

00:26:13.495 --> 00:26:15.745
Number one, Paul is not doing that.

00:26:15.745 --> 00:26:19.284
If you study enough about Paul,
there were so many women that were

00:26:19.284 --> 00:26:23.665
involved in Paul's life from a care
standpoint and co-laboring that

00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:26.304
he would speak about in his books.

00:26:26.695 --> 00:26:27.475
Paul's not bashing.

00:26:28.435 --> 00:26:31.285
Paul's actually talking about,
again, we're dealing with why

00:26:31.285 --> 00:26:33.175
is Timothy getting this letter?

00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:36.415
Because he's addressing false teachers
and leaders who are trying to disrupt

00:26:36.415 --> 00:26:38.485
services and, and change the culture.

00:26:39.385 --> 00:26:41.965
And so this is where we look at
it and say, these women must've

00:26:41.965 --> 00:26:45.504
been doing something that
was distracting the services.

00:26:45.504 --> 00:26:47.875
And so when we look at this, I want
to, I want us to look at this again.

00:26:48.175 --> 00:26:50.004
He says a woman should learn quietly.

00:26:50.065 --> 00:26:50.845
So I started looking at.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.330
What does the word quietly mean?

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.740
What does the word quietly mean?

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.379
You begin to go and study
it assist to be peaceable.

00:26:58.889 --> 00:26:59.940
So what does peaceable mean?

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.280
Well, we had to go back to second Timothy.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:05.970
So we first Timothy chapter two in
verse two, verse two, where he's

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:10.200
talking about living peaceful lives,
living a peaceful life means one

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.550
that doesn't cause distraction.

00:27:12.465 --> 00:27:16.455
So when we hear that word quietly
translated to peaceable and to live

00:27:16.575 --> 00:27:21.675
a undistracted life, we understand
that these women he's addressing

00:27:21.675 --> 00:27:24.285
where women who are probably
causing distractions in the church,

00:27:25.215 --> 00:27:26.655
causing distractions in the church.

00:27:26.955 --> 00:27:30.255
And so he's addressing them and
saying, you need to live a quiet life.

00:27:30.265 --> 00:27:34.080
And he, then he says this, he
says in full sun, What does

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.460
this full submission understand?

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.850
Well, this is the authority that
God has placed in the church.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.650
I think so you all know this is a
tough, fun text to jump through and,

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.440
and, and work on, but he talks about
this full submission in the church and

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.610
understanding that these women were not
recognizing the leadership in the church.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.560
So you understand this,
and this is just a.

00:27:53.235 --> 00:27:56.024
So you, so I can try to be as
clear and honest as possible.

00:27:56.504 --> 00:27:59.135
Understanding the authority in the
church is very similar to understanding

00:27:59.155 --> 00:28:02.564
authority in your job or authority in the
school that you're at with your teacher.

00:28:03.254 --> 00:28:07.334
It's not that they're the end all, and
they can make decisions for your life,

00:28:07.544 --> 00:28:10.364
but they have a role in your life, in
an authority or in life, in a control

00:28:10.364 --> 00:28:14.385
in your life as to how church services
should run or how school services

00:28:14.385 --> 00:28:16.215
should run or how your job should be.

00:28:17.445 --> 00:28:21.525
And so when we look at this, he's saying,
be in full submission to the authority

00:28:21.705 --> 00:28:25.365
in the church, these women were not
submitting to the authority in the church.

00:28:25.365 --> 00:28:26.595
Why would Paul say that?

00:28:27.195 --> 00:28:30.735
Because Paul is saying Timothy, my true
son in the faith who I have given the

00:28:30.735 --> 00:28:35.205
truth of God to teach you has authority
over your life to teach you the truth.

00:28:36.135 --> 00:28:38.325
And so he's saying you should fully
submit to the truth that they're

00:28:38.325 --> 00:28:39.975
sharing, because I know what is true.

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:42.315
And I know that leadership
that he has there is.

00:28:43.275 --> 00:28:45.255
And so when, when you start
looking to this text, we start

00:28:45.255 --> 00:28:48.705
making these assumptions based
out of that, that these women were

00:28:48.705 --> 00:28:50.385
probably not following authority.

00:28:50.385 --> 00:28:52.575
They were not being peaceable.

00:28:52.575 --> 00:28:54.885
They were being
distractions in the church.

00:28:55.485 --> 00:28:59.775
And I make that statement very similar
to teachers as a great example, because

00:28:59.775 --> 00:29:02.685
I think about this, your teacher,
and if you've ever been in school.

00:29:02.685 --> 00:29:05.535
So, and I may not be speaking to
the majority of the group here, but

00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:08.115
if you've ever been in school, your
teacher has the authority over you.

00:29:08.355 --> 00:29:10.755
Your teacher has more knowledge
in the subject over you.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:16.970
The children in that class, excuse me,
in that class can not disrupt the class.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.880
And if they do, they're going to
distract the students around them.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:24.710
And the school sets up an authority
that the teacher has the authority

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.780
to keep the class from disruptions.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.610
Because if not, there would be chaos.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.530
So think about this.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.120
Why is Paul saying this to Timothy?

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.090
Because if there's no
control and the church.

00:29:36.135 --> 00:29:38.925
Then distractions happen from the
mission that God's called them to do.

00:29:39.375 --> 00:29:43.725
And these women happened to be some
people that were not listening to

00:29:43.725 --> 00:29:45.885
authority and they were causing
distractions in the church.

00:29:46.395 --> 00:29:49.095
So then we look at verse 12 and
this is where it continues on.

00:29:49.395 --> 00:29:52.725
He says, I do not allow women to
teach or to have authority over a man.

00:29:52.725 --> 00:29:53.625
Instead she has to remain.

00:29:54.855 --> 00:29:56.504
Um, and this is another one, right?

00:29:56.504 --> 00:29:58.004
As is women to never teach.

00:29:58.275 --> 00:30:00.615
Well again, if you study the
Bible, you understand women

00:30:00.615 --> 00:30:02.145
do have the ability to teach.

00:30:02.475 --> 00:30:05.325
And I believe that Paul's addressing
two things and the rest of the

00:30:05.325 --> 00:30:06.705
text actually deals with this.

00:30:06.945 --> 00:30:07.995
Paul is addressing two things.

00:30:07.995 --> 00:30:11.504
He's also addressing, um,
how it directly means.

00:30:12.615 --> 00:30:16.155
In the home when he's speaking to the home
and this is where verses 13 and 14 come

00:30:16.155 --> 00:30:21.825
in, he says for Adam was formed first,
then Eve and Adam was not deceived, but

00:30:21.825 --> 00:30:24.285
the woman was deceived and transgressed.

00:30:25.275 --> 00:30:28.995
So what we understand is God's
original design was that the man was

00:30:28.995 --> 00:30:30.105
supposed to be leader in the home.

00:30:31.725 --> 00:30:32.865
Not better.

00:30:34.175 --> 00:30:36.335
Because they are co laborers and
we're going to read something here

00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:38.345
in just a minute, but that they were
supposed to be the leader in the home.

00:30:38.675 --> 00:30:40.985
And as we can see, Adam was
not the leader in the home.

00:30:41.285 --> 00:30:47.945
And what is Paula saying is that women
should basically not be the leader

00:30:47.945 --> 00:30:52.265
in the home or in the church for the
fact of God's design was that the men

00:30:52.265 --> 00:30:53.615
should be that leadership position.

00:30:53.975 --> 00:30:56.645
But I want us to look at something
together because I think it will help help

00:30:56.645 --> 00:30:58.865
us understand this is this idea between.

00:31:00.015 --> 00:31:03.045
That the importance of the role
and the authority of the role.

00:31:03.045 --> 00:31:03.795
And so let's look at this.

00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:07.785
If you guys will turn with me at
Ephesians chapter five, you won't

00:31:07.785 --> 00:31:12.555
have to go backwards very much, but
Ephesians chapter five, we're going

00:31:12.555 --> 00:31:14.235
to look at verses 22 through 33.

00:31:14.235 --> 00:31:15.435
And I thought it was really cool.

00:31:15.825 --> 00:31:19.005
We actually studied through the
book of Ephesians last year, and

00:31:19.005 --> 00:31:23.145
then we decided to go into verse
Timothy and how they connect here

00:31:23.145 --> 00:31:25.365
with the emphasis in the fusion.

00:31:26.719 --> 00:31:32.719
So Ephesians chapter five verses
22 through 33, this is talking

00:31:32.719 --> 00:31:33.860
about the leadership in the home.

00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:39.110
And so it says this wives submit to
your husbands as to the Lord, because

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:44.449
the husband is the head of the wife
as Christ is head of the church.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:45.709
And he is the savior of the.

00:31:46.784 --> 00:31:48.344
Now as the church submits to Christ.

00:31:48.344 --> 00:31:51.014
So also wives are to submit to
their husbands in everything.

00:31:51.465 --> 00:31:54.975
And husbands love your wives just
as Christ loved the church and gave

00:31:54.975 --> 00:32:00.014
himself for her to make her a holy
cleansing, a holy and cleansing her

00:32:00.014 --> 00:32:01.465
with the washing of the water by the.

00:32:02.735 --> 00:32:06.485
And he did this in the present to present
the church to himself in splendor,

00:32:06.485 --> 00:32:11.495
without spot or wrinkle or anything
of the like, but holy and blameless

00:32:11.825 --> 00:32:15.004
and the same way husbands are to
love their wives as their own bodies.

00:32:15.305 --> 00:32:19.985
He who loves his wife, loves himself
for no one ever hates his own flesh,

00:32:20.195 --> 00:32:23.315
but provides and cares for it just
as Christ does for the church.

00:32:23.585 --> 00:32:26.915
Since we are many members of it, for this
reason, a man will leave his mother and

00:32:26.915 --> 00:32:28.835
father and he will be joined to his wife.

00:32:28.835 --> 00:32:30.155
And two, we become one.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.229
This mystery is profound, but I'm
talking about Christ in the church

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:38.129
to sum up each one of you is to love
his wife as himself and his wife

00:32:38.129 --> 00:32:40.260
is supposed to respect her husband.

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:45.080
I've read this text here and I'm
trying to be as clear as I can,

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.490
but also we only have so much time.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:51.919
Whenever Paul is specifically sitting
here and addressing women who are

00:32:51.919 --> 00:32:56.209
supposed to not teach and have
authority over men, it's understanding

00:32:56.209 --> 00:33:00.229
God's original design in the home
was for the man to lead the home now.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.340
So important here that I love this picture
in Ephesians chapter five, when they are

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:12.044
joined together, they are one, I believe
that when men lead correctly, Women are

00:33:12.044 --> 00:33:15.135
leading right alongside them there one.

00:33:15.345 --> 00:33:20.774
So when he leads, they're one, when
she is submitting their one and

00:33:20.774 --> 00:33:24.615
it's not, and I love this picture,
men had the more important role.

00:33:24.615 --> 00:33:28.605
Adam is the one that should've stopped
his wife from eating the wrong fruit.

00:33:29.595 --> 00:33:33.555
And today I believe in this text,
the men probably should have stood up

00:33:33.555 --> 00:33:37.665
and handled that situation where the
women were taking control and said no,

00:33:37.665 --> 00:33:39.555
like we should stand up and lead by.

00:33:40.935 --> 00:33:41.715
But they didn't.

00:33:41.715 --> 00:33:43.245
And so Paul's having to address it.

00:33:43.245 --> 00:33:46.034
So that's specifically to the
home, but then when we look at the.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.399
And we're actually going to
deal with eldership next week.

00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:54.300
So many of you will not be here next week,
but Paul actually sets up how you can

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.129
become an elder and what that looks like.

00:33:56.129 --> 00:33:59.790
And the responsibility of the elder
is, is, is a man's role in this fact.

00:34:00.209 --> 00:34:05.489
But it's all also speaking as a, directly
to how the church was set up by God.

00:34:05.489 --> 00:34:08.850
So in the church, Paul was also speaking
specifically about church eldership

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:13.350
elders and pastors had the authority in
the church to lead and teach the church.

00:34:14.054 --> 00:34:17.685
And I always think of Ephesians 12,
Ephesians four 12, which says that

00:34:17.864 --> 00:34:21.705
ministers or elders are supposed to equip
the saints for the work of the ministry.

00:34:22.364 --> 00:34:27.315
And so God divine, a divine Providence
was for men to be appointed in the church

00:34:27.344 --> 00:34:29.324
to lead the church and to lead the.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:33.569
But women have such an
important role in the church.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:34.980
So can the women teach?

00:34:35.009 --> 00:34:36.000
That's a great question.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.350
I have to answer in this text.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.110
Can they teach the Bible
says absolutely 100%.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:43.350
You see it all over the Bible where
women teach other women, women teach it.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:44.219
Here's the coolest part.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:44.870
Do you know?

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:50.670
Paul's or not Paul's Timothy's grandmother
and mother raised Timothy up in the truth.

00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:53.609
So they taught Timothy all
the way up until he met.

00:34:53.609 --> 00:34:54.690
Paul is sort of following Paul.

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:56.639
They had an important role in teaching.

00:34:56.819 --> 00:34:57.960
Here's another cool part.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.750
Also in acts, I think it's acts 1826.

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:04.140
There's two people, a man and
a wife or a man and husband.

00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:06.299
I'm saying this all wrong.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.950
I'm heading you guys down
the wrong trail here.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:14.089
I'm going to say the slowest.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:14.370
Why I say it?

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:18.960
Husband and a wife took a man
aside and began to teach him the

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.280
truth where he was going wrong.

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:22.500
Women have an important role in teaching.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:26.910
Now, the other question is, does this mean
that women can't make decisions in the

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:30.240
church help teach in certain situations
to become leaders in the church?

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.930
The answer is they actually can
under the leadership and authority

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:37.170
that God has placed in the
church by men to lead the charge.

00:35:38.725 --> 00:35:40.855
And so I, I was thinking
about this as a pastor.

00:35:41.155 --> 00:35:45.805
I had the responsibility as what's exactly
what Timothy is being challenged with to

00:35:45.805 --> 00:35:47.785
make sure that the truth is being taught.

00:35:47.995 --> 00:35:52.915
And that as a church, we are leading a
godly church under the authority that God

00:35:52.915 --> 00:35:54.535
has given me as an elder in the church.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.280
And so will women teach in and throughout
our church in different situations?

00:35:59.310 --> 00:35:59.940
Absolutely.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:00.509
100%.

00:36:00.509 --> 00:36:05.520
I believe God has defined that to have
an authority as a whole over the church,

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:10.410
or to have an authority over a man,
completely God, doesn't divine that.

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:11.820
And that's exactly what
we're seeing this text.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.180
And I, I had to kind of deal with
this in the nutshell, but we're also

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:18.780
dealing with this and what we believe
these women were probably doing.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.970
They were taking leadership
positions from the men.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.090
They were standing up and they were
speaking and they were speaking false.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.380
'cause that's why Paul's writing
this letter because there were people

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.259
that were coming in and teaching
incorrectly about the gospel.

00:36:31.259 --> 00:36:34.259
That Jesus was not the way
that the law was the way.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.250
And so they were causing distractions
by how they were trying to take these

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.910
positions and teach and correctly
and not listen to authority.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.500
And they were not being peaceable.

00:36:44.399 --> 00:36:45.210
So I want to read this.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:48.270
I heard this from John Piper
and we're going to move on.

00:36:48.689 --> 00:36:51.210
John Piper described authority
and submission this way.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:56.040
He said authority refers to the
divine calling of spiritual gifted

00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:00.600
men that take primary responsibility
as elders for Christ, like servant

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.399
leadership teaching in the church.

00:37:03.089 --> 00:37:05.730
But submission refers to the
divine calling of the rest of

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.700
the church, both men and women to
honor and affirm the leadership of

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.379
the elders and to be equipped by.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.009
For the hundreds and hundreds
of various ministries available

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:15.480
to men and women in church.

00:37:16.049 --> 00:37:19.020
So that's just a little bit more of
a clear picture when we talk about

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.850
submission and authority, but then we look
at verse 15 and this is where it gets.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.380
It gets fun to kind of explain this.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:29.220
He says verse 15, but she's speaking
of women will be saved through

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:32.610
childbearing if they continue in the
faith, love holiness with good sense.

00:37:33.509 --> 00:37:35.279
Get more back in first
Timothy, if you're wondering.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.520
So Paul's referencing the position
that most women held in that.

00:37:39.995 --> 00:37:41.225
As childbearers.

00:37:41.825 --> 00:37:44.525
And for starters, when we look at
this text, it's actually interesting.

00:37:45.485 --> 00:37:47.075
It says women will be
saved through childbearing.

00:37:47.075 --> 00:37:54.904
If you guys will go back to Genesis,
there was a prophecy made that there

00:37:54.904 --> 00:37:59.194
would be a woman that would bear a child
who would save the world from their sins.

00:38:00.775 --> 00:38:01.735
And this is Mary.

00:38:02.515 --> 00:38:05.995
And so actually all of us are
saved through a woman, burying

00:38:05.995 --> 00:38:07.405
a child, which is Jesus.

00:38:08.095 --> 00:38:09.685
And it's interesting to think about this.

00:38:09.685 --> 00:38:14.545
He's actually lifting up the woman's
position and saying it is a important

00:38:14.575 --> 00:38:17.185
position that brought forth Christ.

00:38:17.185 --> 00:38:17.725
Wow.

00:38:18.115 --> 00:38:19.405
Like that is amazing.

00:38:19.555 --> 00:38:23.095
Paul's pointing that out, but then he also
says, he, speaking of mothers who do bear

00:38:23.095 --> 00:38:24.805
into bearing child, you have an important.

00:38:26.145 --> 00:38:27.045
You and your husband.

00:38:27.045 --> 00:38:30.315
Cause he says this, if you both
continue in love and faith and

00:38:30.315 --> 00:38:33.525
holiness with good sense, he
says, this is how you don't cost.

00:38:33.525 --> 00:38:37.815
Distractions is by you lead by the
godly example and the godly prescription

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:41.775
that God has set forth for men to lead
in the home, not to be better, but

00:38:41.775 --> 00:38:44.145
to lead in their position in which
God's placed them in women to lead in

00:38:44.145 --> 00:38:45.075
the position that God's placed them.

00:38:45.075 --> 00:38:45.645
Does this mean?

00:38:45.645 --> 00:38:47.385
And this is what as good
question everybody has.

00:38:47.685 --> 00:38:51.705
This is mean every woman is
subject to be just childbearers

00:38:51.705 --> 00:38:53.145
and to work from the home.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:55.830
That's not what he is saying.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:00.630
He's saying that through this, in
his time Mitt, most of the women

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:04.290
did live this way, where all they
were, they were at home childbearing.

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:05.160
I'll tell you this.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.560
It's one of the most important
positions and my wife's not here today.

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.230
She's at home with our sick
kids and I'll tell you this, her

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:15.090
role in the house, I would say
sometimes more important than mine.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:17.550
And I'm so thankful she's at
home taking care of my kids.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:22.920
So when you look at this, this is
actually raising the woman's position.

00:39:23.745 --> 00:39:28.995
To a high level of importance and
the role of not only her faith and

00:39:28.995 --> 00:39:30.105
her, but it's our family's faith.

00:39:31.245 --> 00:39:32.415
So here, here's the important thing.

00:39:32.445 --> 00:39:36.075
All of our roles are important, but in
this text, Paul was specifically pointing

00:39:36.075 --> 00:39:39.735
to women to not be a distraction for the
mission for men to not be a distraction

00:39:39.735 --> 00:39:43.245
from the mission and how they were
acting in the church and around other

00:39:43.245 --> 00:39:45.375
believers, this can apply to our churches.

00:39:46.325 --> 00:39:49.445
Of how we can become distractions
to other people, fulfilling the

00:39:49.445 --> 00:39:50.795
mission that's in their life.

00:39:50.795 --> 00:39:53.375
And we can become the distraction
also, and us fulfilling the

00:39:53.375 --> 00:39:54.635
mission that isn't our life.

00:39:54.665 --> 00:39:54.995
Yes.

00:39:54.995 --> 00:39:56.705
We can look at this in context today.

00:39:56.825 --> 00:39:58.745
We can see the issues that
Paul was dealing with.

00:39:58.865 --> 00:40:02.825
We can talk a little bit about leadership
and women's submission and men's roles,

00:40:03.215 --> 00:40:06.935
but I want us to understand that I believe
Paul is dealing with false teachers

00:40:06.935 --> 00:40:10.985
who were trying to rise up and prevent
Christ from being preached correctly.

00:40:11.735 --> 00:40:14.075
And he is saying, I need to
shut this down by speaking.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:18.660
About these truths to be
able to correct them and help

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.700
Timothy not back down from this.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:24.840
So we have to view this text in
light of that, therefore, right?

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.420
The God's ultimate desires
for everyone to be saved.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:31.560
And then anything that we did that
distracts from that purpose needs

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.880
to be changed and dealt with.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:38.190
So our roles are, are important
today to deal with this.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.590
And so we, we always take a
time at the end of service.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.450
I'm gonna, I'll talk through a
few more things type of theme to

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:43.560
service, to talk about Invictus.

00:40:44.685 --> 00:40:47.535
And most churches don't talk
enough about invitation.

00:40:47.535 --> 00:40:50.384
That's not a knock on them more
than I want to be as best we can.

00:40:50.625 --> 00:40:53.955
Invitation is not about just standing
up and singing the song that the worship

00:40:54.194 --> 00:40:57.525
pastor leads, um, and, and, and go on out.

00:40:58.245 --> 00:41:03.345
The time for invitation is an opportunity
to be invited, to take a next step

00:41:03.555 --> 00:41:08.234
for whatever God taught you today to
say, Hey, there's something I need to

00:41:08.234 --> 00:41:10.025
apply to my, apply to myself in this.

00:41:11.265 --> 00:41:13.605
And so what could that be for men?

00:41:13.935 --> 00:41:16.125
It could be, Hey, we need to lead.

00:41:16.485 --> 00:41:17.805
We need to be examples.

00:41:17.985 --> 00:41:18.585
And I love this.

00:41:18.585 --> 00:41:22.005
We need to be servants to those around
us because that's what Christ says is

00:41:22.005 --> 00:41:25.995
that men serve men set the example.

00:41:26.235 --> 00:41:29.385
So maybe that's a challenge for you men
to step up and deal with that in your

00:41:29.385 --> 00:41:33.855
heart to, to be a leader and to serve
well for some of you could be, Hey,

00:41:33.855 --> 00:41:35.265
I'm being a distraction to my friends.

00:41:37.045 --> 00:41:41.605
I'm, I'm not living in such a way
that is pointing them to Christ by

00:41:41.605 --> 00:41:43.975
the way that I'm dressing, by the way
that I'm talking, by the way that I'm

00:41:43.975 --> 00:41:47.605
acting for some of us, it could be.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.120
That we are dealing with.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.270
Some of the things that we're dealing
with here is that, um, that that outward

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.250
appearance is obviously not honoring God.

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:58.220
Um, or maybe your role in the church.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.800
You're being one that is causing
controversy in the church

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.390
or around other believers.

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:05.780
I don't know what it is that God may be
speaking to you about, but I think all of

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.560
us can learn today that we need to avoid
distractions that distract us from the

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.870
mission that God has called us to fulfill.

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:17.600
So my challenge to you is to ask God
during this time of invitation, what.

00:42:18.945 --> 00:42:23.175
That I need to turn from what is it
that I need to take a next step in?

00:42:24.105 --> 00:42:25.935
And they get in that can be
personal distractions, that

00:42:25.935 --> 00:42:28.065
God is challenging you on.

00:42:28.065 --> 00:42:31.875
It could be distracting others
that God is challenging you on.

00:42:32.595 --> 00:42:33.795
Maybe for you.

00:42:33.825 --> 00:42:37.875
It's you've been allowing all the
worldly distractions to distract

00:42:37.875 --> 00:42:39.075
you from following Christ.

00:42:40.185 --> 00:42:43.935
And that's my last challenge to you as
we come in here today and an interesting

00:42:43.935 --> 00:42:49.095
text to jump into and deal with, but I
would say this, that God so loves you.

00:42:49.095 --> 00:42:52.875
We are here every single Sunday, not
because that's what we're supposed to do.

00:42:54.355 --> 00:42:57.475
We're here because we believe
this service makes a difference.

00:42:57.655 --> 00:43:00.145
When we grow in our relationship
with Christ, we learn more about him.

00:43:00.145 --> 00:43:03.415
We get the opportunity to worship and
understand that God is so important.

00:43:03.415 --> 00:43:05.785
It's to put the priorities
right in our life.

00:43:06.205 --> 00:43:08.605
So God may be saying this
today, you showed up today.

00:43:08.725 --> 00:43:11.455
You're a part of the mission team, or you
showed up today and you've been a part of

00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:15.505
the church for awhile, but you've allowed
everything around you to distract you

00:43:15.655 --> 00:43:18.745
from giving your life to Christ today.

00:43:18.925 --> 00:43:19.765
Eliminate the distraction.

00:43:21.145 --> 00:43:23.365
Today is the day of salvation.

00:43:23.395 --> 00:43:26.065
Today's the day to say, Hey, I
want to give my life to Christ.

00:43:26.365 --> 00:43:29.935
I want to start following him
and learning more about how it is

00:43:29.935 --> 00:43:31.045
to have a relationship with him.

00:43:31.765 --> 00:43:35.575
And if that's you today, my commitment
every week that I'm here is to hang out

00:43:35.575 --> 00:43:37.105
in the back by the next steps table.

00:43:37.315 --> 00:43:39.685
And during the invitation, you can
come back and talk to me if you need

00:43:39.685 --> 00:43:42.955
prayer, if you need somebody to counsel
with you, I'm here to talk with you.

00:43:43.255 --> 00:43:45.985
But my challenge today do not leave today.

00:43:46.495 --> 00:43:48.505
Before you take a next
step in the area of your.

00:43:49.695 --> 00:43:52.695
And what we talked about today, or
an area of your faith in giving your

00:43:52.695 --> 00:43:56.535
life to Christ, because God desires
to do abundantly more than you can

00:43:56.535 --> 00:44:01.095
ask or think, and he desires to
know you and for you to know him.

00:44:01.665 --> 00:44:02.535
So we're going to pray.

00:44:02.535 --> 00:44:06.405
And after I pray, we're going to stand
and worship here in invitation, seek

00:44:06.405 --> 00:44:07.935
the Lord and what he's asking you to do.

00:44:08.325 --> 00:44:11.775
And I just pray that the Lord
changes your heart as we do this.

00:44:11.775 --> 00:44:14.235
So Lord, we just love you, Lord.

00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:15.675
We're so thankful for today.

00:44:16.035 --> 00:44:17.355
We're so thankful for your love.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:21.480
And your grace and your
mercy in our lives Lord.

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.180
And today Lord could be easily.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.370
Just the message itself
could be distracting.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.200
Maybe it can be confusing.

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.890
Lord, I pray that you remove all of it.

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:36.000
The Lord you take time for each one of us.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.660
Lord, if we've checked out or if we've
Lord fallen asleep in the middle of

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.740
the message, maybe we wake up right
now and we take time to consider

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:46.230
Lord what you are trying to teach.

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:52.800
Well, I think you just remind
us of how important it is for us

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.240
to know you personally, and Lord
how much you changed our lives.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:01.200
And Lord, if you've changed our lives
and given us a hope and a peace and

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.860
forgiveness Lord, that we desire
others to experience that same thing.

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.700
So Lord, if we do desire for the
others to experience that same

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:12.990
thing, Lord, I pray that we today
repent and turn from the distraction.

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:16.950
They're preventing us from
fulfilling that call in our lives.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:23.010
Lord, let us not miss that opportunity
because there is way too many

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:26.580
people that need to know you that
that may not be here tomorrow.

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:30.960
They need to know you today or let us not
get distracted by the things that will

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:37.620
prohibit us from fulfilling the call of
seeing as many people saved as we can.

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:41.700
So Lord, we love you and we
pray this in your holy name.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:43.710
Amen.
