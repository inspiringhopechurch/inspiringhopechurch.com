00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.280
And so kind of just over the next three
weeks, we're going to kind of talk

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.270
through a couple different things.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.380
We're going to see really here.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.860
We're going to walk through the
gospels, um, and see some different

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.560
songs or some different praises, um,
before, during and after Jesus's birth.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.550
And I think it's going to be unique
because I've never seen, um, really, uh,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.590
uh, texts kind of walk through this way.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.320
So I'm, I'm excited to kind of walk
through that with you guys in this.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.180
Um, but I do recognize this.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.170
I know during the season.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:31.515
Uh, for some of you,
it could be difficult.

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:33.825
Uh, one of those reasons it can be
difficult is this could be the first

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:38.505
season that you are dealing with, um, a
loss of a loved one, um, that you've not

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.394
been with during this Christmas season.

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:41.445
And that's gotta be difficult.

00:00:41.835 --> 00:00:44.865
Um, I know for some of you,
it's also, um, you're dealing

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:46.245
with the stress of Christmas.

00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:50.955
Um, if, if you're anything like
me is it seems like every week

00:00:50.955 --> 00:00:52.004
you're doing something different.

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:52.585
If you're not buying.

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:54.555
You're planning parties.

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:58.065
If you're not planning parties, your
going to parties, you're having dinners.

00:00:58.065 --> 00:00:58.845
You're hosting dinners.

00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:00.375
You're traveling to go see family, right?

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:04.845
And so it's easy to get distracted
in this season of activity.

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:08.565
But my, my hope and prayer is that
during this Christmas series that we

00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:13.815
walk through, the each one of us will
make Christ the focus of the season,

00:01:13.815 --> 00:01:15.465
no matter what you're doing, right?

00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:18.705
No matter if you're buying gifts
or if you're planning a party,

00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:21.465
or if you're going to one, you
can still make Christ the center.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.520
Because that is the reason why we have
this season to be able to celebrate.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.020
And so I want to just start off that way.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.190
I want to ask, what is your
favorite part of Christmas?

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.260
What is your favorite part of it?

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.230
Okay, give me like your top three.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.960
If you have to everything.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.440
Okay.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.720
Laughing with family.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.440
That's a good one.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.590
Yeah.

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:52.884
Food.

00:01:52.884 --> 00:01:53.695
Yes.

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.725
Waiting on that one a couple more.

00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:57.595
What's your favorite?

00:01:57.685 --> 00:01:58.375
The lights.

00:01:58.375 --> 00:01:58.645
Yeah.

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:00.175
Presence.

00:02:00.205 --> 00:02:00.445
Okay.

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:02.455
Brittany, we know you love it all.

00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:04.435
Hashtag I love Christmas.

00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:05.365
Everything about it.

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:06.235
Yes.

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:08.315
Anybody else?

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:09.755
What's your favorite part of Christmas?

00:02:10.894 --> 00:02:11.495
Jesus.

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:12.245
Hey, there we go.

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:14.225
We got somebody that's yes.

00:02:14.225 --> 00:02:16.745
You get an a in the class,
no matter what else you do.

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:17.135
Okay.

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.559
Um, yes, Jesus.

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:23.429
And so I, again, I think one of the
things that's so cool about Christmas

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.260
is that there's so many different
elements of it that we can enjoy.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.190
Um, and, and I think that the
thing that happens at times though,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.510
is we do get distracted by it.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.719
So I would just say this as you think
through those things that you love about.

00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:41.115
I want you to start thinking through
how you can filter that through

00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:44.655
what Christ has done for us during
the season, because he's the reason

00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:46.305
why we get to enjoy those things.

00:02:46.305 --> 00:02:48.975
Why we get to enjoy food while we get
to, to enjoy laughter why we get to

00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:53.685
enjoy friends and fellowship and all
these different things that we love is

00:02:53.685 --> 00:02:55.275
because of what Christ has done for us.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:59.235
And so before we jump into this text,
um, I want to just kind of give you

00:02:59.235 --> 00:03:01.095
a little bit of the background and
the cool part is we're going to be in

00:03:01.095 --> 00:03:04.425
Luke chapter one verses 46 through 55.

00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:08.685
So I don't have to catch you up on much
because the chapter just started in Luke.

00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:13.335
So Luke one, we're gonna start in first
46, but here's what's happened before.

00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:17.445
This is an angel visited
Mary, the mother of Jesus.

00:03:17.805 --> 00:03:22.515
And so this angel came, um, and
said, Hey, uh, Mary, and this is,

00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:24.015
again, it sounds so simple, right?

00:03:24.015 --> 00:03:24.615
Hey Mary.

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:27.225
So you're going to have a child.

00:03:27.495 --> 00:03:28.635
I know you're not married.

00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:32.415
Um, and it's going to be God's son, Jesus.

00:03:32.415 --> 00:03:35.665
And she's like, I mean, I
don't know about you guys.

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:37.105
I'm pretty sure I'd be
saying the same thing.

00:03:37.135 --> 00:03:41.845
Of course, I'm a guy, but you know, if I
was a girl non-married, I'd really okay.

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:42.715
I've really be saying that.

00:03:42.715 --> 00:03:42.895
Right.

00:03:42.895 --> 00:03:46.165
So, uh, yes, Lord, what do you thinking?

00:03:46.315 --> 00:03:47.545
Uh, what are you doing?

00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:50.425
And so obviously it's an
angel to speaking to her.

00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:52.945
So she's kind of listening
to him to this angel.

00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:56.005
She's kind of going back and forth
and here's a couple of verses

00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:56.815
that really stick out to me.

00:03:56.815 --> 00:04:01.135
So finally, after going back and
forth about how and why, um, this

00:04:01.135 --> 00:04:06.524
is what the angel says to me, For
nothing will be impossible with God.

00:04:07.815 --> 00:04:09.765
And that was the last
thing that Mary heard.

00:04:09.765 --> 00:04:11.654
And that was in verse 37 of Luke one.

00:04:12.255 --> 00:04:14.234
That was the last thing Mary
heard before she said this.

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:18.435
She says, I am the Lord's
servant said, Mary May be done

00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:19.784
to me, according to your word.

00:04:20.414 --> 00:04:23.805
And so at that moment, Mary had
faith, even though she didn't

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.895
have all the details, she
didn't have the whole backstory.

00:04:26.895 --> 00:04:31.875
She had faith to go, okay, God,
you understand this way more than.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.530
And I trust you, and this is
how it began Jesus coming to the

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.020
earth to save us from our sins.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.050
And so here's what happens
right after Mary quickly leaves.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.540
She, and she goes and visits her
relative Elizabeth, um, which I was also

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.090
pregnant with the child and her late age.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.320
Um, does anybody know what
the name of that baby was?

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.710
That Elizabeth was pregnant
with John the Baptist?

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.010
Right.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.350
So John, the Baptist, um, would become.

00:05:02.145 --> 00:05:03.825
To talk about Jesus's coming.

00:05:03.825 --> 00:05:04.305
Right?

00:05:04.785 --> 00:05:07.845
Um, he was the person that
would say that he was coming.

00:05:07.845 --> 00:05:09.225
And so it's interesting.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:12.495
Whenever Elizabeth sees Mary, this
is what she says to Mary, because the

00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:16.365
spirit of God revealed to Elizabeth
that Mary was carrying God's son.

00:05:16.695 --> 00:05:20.745
And so she says this in verse
46, it says blessed is she who

00:05:20.745 --> 00:05:24.315
has believed that the Lord would
fulfill what he has spoken to her.

00:05:25.605 --> 00:05:27.645
And so now this is where we
catch up with Mary, right?

00:05:27.645 --> 00:05:28.485
The angel comes.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.890
And tells her that she's
going to carry God's son and

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.180
have God's son and raise him.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.380
Then she sees Elizabeth and Elizabeth
tells her that she has blessed

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.160
because of her faith that God would
do what God would do through her.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.830
And then Mary goes into this praise
because she's still taking in again.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.700
I think you guys would be a lot like
me is you would be taking in all that

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.790
you just learned and all the things
that had just maybe been said to you.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.080
And she begins to consider it and
she begins to praise God for it.

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.099
And so we're going read, um, now the
text here, so you guys can see this.

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:07.289
And so in verse 46, it says, and Mary
said my soul praises, the greatness

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.849
of the Lord and my spirit rejoices
in God, my savior, because he has

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.929
looked with me or looked with favor
on the humble condition of a servant.

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.609
And surely from now on all generations
will call me blessed because the

00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:22.500
mighty one has done great things.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.680
And his whole, and his name is holy.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.790
His mercy is from generation to
generation on those who fear him.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.670
He has done a mighty deed with his arm.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.090
He has scattered the proud because
of the thoughts of their hearts.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.890
He has toppled toppled, the mighty from
their Thrones and exalted the lowly.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.820
And he has satisfied the hungry with
good things and sent the rich away empty.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.560
He has helped his servant Israel
remembering his mercy to Abraham

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.730
and his descendants forever.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.410
Just to see.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.340
To our ancestors.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.560
So let's dive into this.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.240
I want to just kind of talk about
just the overview of really Mary song.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.050
When we look at this or Mary's praise,
as you begin to study a little bit more

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.300
about this, we realized that in Mary's
praise that she wanted to magnify Christ.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.060
And whenever I heard that,
I loved the idea of today.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.280
We got to sing the song, right?

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.840
Magnify Christ.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.810
And I started thinking through if
the theme of this is to magnify.

00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:22.365
What is the word magnify means.

00:07:22.365 --> 00:07:23.175
So you guys helped me out.

00:07:23.175 --> 00:07:24.104
What is the word magnify?

00:07:24.104 --> 00:07:25.094
You were talking about magnifier.

00:07:25.094 --> 00:07:30.284
What's a magnifying
glasses purpose to expand.

00:07:30.315 --> 00:07:34.155
Thanks for just, I just translate
it for you, but what else?

00:07:36.594 --> 00:07:37.855
What's a couple of things that happen.

00:07:37.855 --> 00:07:42.985
Whenever you look through a magnifying
glass, you can see the details, right?

00:07:42.985 --> 00:07:46.465
It gets bigger, whatever you're
looking at, what happened?

00:07:46.974 --> 00:07:49.015
What's that it's more clear.

00:07:50.325 --> 00:07:51.645
What happens to everything else?

00:07:54.565 --> 00:07:55.195
It seems smaller.

00:07:55.885 --> 00:07:56.485
It seems smaller.

00:07:57.415 --> 00:07:59.875
I think you guys know where
we're going with this, right?

00:07:59.905 --> 00:08:05.215
If Christ is being magnified
by Mary in this right.

00:08:05.215 --> 00:08:09.295
It's, it's teaching us to
focus in during the season.

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:14.005
It's teaching us to, to make him
big and everything else small.

00:08:14.034 --> 00:08:16.435
Now those things are okay.

00:08:16.885 --> 00:08:18.775
The season of Christmas and
the things we enjoy our.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.540
But Christ be magnified because
he is the one that receives

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.070
the glory during the season.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.280
And so that's just my hope, as we think
through this, that everything else

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.100
becomes less important, but Christ
becomes the most important thing.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.010
And so, as we walk through these verses,
we're going to see that Mary gave

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.470
praise during the season of Christ's
birth because of what God did for her,

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.100
what God did for the people of Israel
and what God ultimately did forever.

00:08:45.075 --> 00:08:47.085
And so let's just start walking
through that, in that order.

00:08:47.085 --> 00:08:49.455
So the first thing we see
in these first three verses,

00:08:49.815 --> 00:08:51.315
um, is what God did for Mary.

00:08:51.315 --> 00:08:54.915
So we see Mary said in verse
46, it says my soul praises,

00:08:54.915 --> 00:08:56.025
the greatness of the Lord.

00:08:56.535 --> 00:09:01.665
So I asked myself this question,
why could Mary say my soul

00:09:01.665 --> 00:09:03.195
praises, the greatness of the Lord?

00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:05.505
And she answers it in verse 47.

00:09:05.505 --> 00:09:10.425
She says this and my spirit rejoices
in God, my savior, because at

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:13.485
that moment, Mary recognize that.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.850
The son of God that was living
inside of her, came to save her.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.100
He was her savior.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.569
And I thought that was important,
that, that she first recognized that

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:32.370
God sent Jesus to save her from her
sins to save her from a life without

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.960
obviously an eternal perspective and
so much in some, so, so much more.

00:09:38.175 --> 00:09:41.685
And so as she was looking at this and I
love this idea, she not only calls God

00:09:41.685 --> 00:09:43.335
her savior, it's more than her words.

00:09:43.335 --> 00:09:44.235
It's her posture.

00:09:44.445 --> 00:09:49.695
And you'll see that in verse 48, it says,
because he has looked with favor on the

00:09:49.695 --> 00:09:53.145
humble condition of a servant humility.

00:09:53.775 --> 00:09:55.485
Mary shows humility.

00:09:55.935 --> 00:09:59.445
And we see this even with a couple of
the verses that we read earlier, where

00:09:59.445 --> 00:10:04.965
she says there in verse 38, it says,
may it be done according to your word?

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.010
Um, I am the Lord's servant.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.650
And so Mary's humble condition, right.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.630
And God had chose her.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.680
And I love that idea.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.240
Is that not only did God save
her, he was her say his semi.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.709
He was her savior, but God chose her
when he could have chosen anyone.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.750
See, I think too many times when we think
about what God has done for us in this

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.600
season, we forget that God chose us.

00:10:30.689 --> 00:10:32.970
He didn't have to, he didn't have to.

00:10:33.704 --> 00:10:39.824
If you think about Mary Mary understood
that God chose her to be a part of a great

00:10:39.824 --> 00:10:42.074
plan to bring salvation to the world.

00:10:44.364 --> 00:10:49.104
And then we look a little bit further
and we see, um, well actually let me ask

00:10:49.104 --> 00:10:52.375
this question, cause I think this is a
great question to ask when we think about

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:56.334
why God chose Mary, why do you think
God chose Mary over any other person?

00:10:56.334 --> 00:11:01.094
Do you think there's any particular
reason why she was humble?

00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:04.689
Why else do you think that God chose Mary?

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.590
She was a descendant of David.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.430
So obviously he had previously in the
old Testament, talked about that he was

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.010
going to send Jesus through that lineage.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:23.670
So that's true.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.500
We see her childlike faith.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.910
I think that you look
at two things, right?

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.880
That the humility and her face.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.880
And we go well, did God know that
she was going to have that faith?

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.140
And I would believe so.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.950
He knew who he was choosing
to, to raise up Jesus.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.920
And I think about that and I think
it's important for us to think through

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:47.700
this is that God chooses those who
are humble and faithful to do the

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.870
work that he's called us to choose.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.300
And so I'm just looking at,
Mary's an example of somebody

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.620
that I could follow after, right.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.580
That she recognized to give praise to
God and only what for, for savings.

00:11:57.345 --> 00:12:00.765
But for choosing her because she
recognized God didn't have to do that.

00:12:01.515 --> 00:12:04.425
Um, but so we see that, that,
right, so that, that God saved

00:12:04.425 --> 00:12:08.895
her, that she recognized who Jesus
was, um, that God could use her.

00:12:09.525 --> 00:12:12.855
But here was the last thing that
I saw here in verses 48 and 49.

00:12:12.855 --> 00:12:15.405
It says because he has looked
with her on favor, on her humble

00:12:15.405 --> 00:12:17.595
condition of, of his servant.

00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:21.825
Surely now from all generations
will call me blessed because the

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:24.225
mighty one has done great things.

00:12:25.095 --> 00:12:26.715
And his name is holy.

00:12:27.315 --> 00:12:30.165
And so God was mighty for her.

00:12:30.165 --> 00:12:33.435
So God was mighty for, and I started
thinking about what does that mean

00:12:33.435 --> 00:12:35.625
for God to be mighty for Mary?

00:12:36.495 --> 00:12:38.865
So most of you may know
the story, are you not?

00:12:38.865 --> 00:12:40.515
So if not, I'm just going
to kind of fill you in here.

00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:42.105
At this point.

00:12:42.405 --> 00:12:47.145
The only person that knew that Mary
was pregnant was Mary and Elizabeth.

00:12:48.015 --> 00:12:50.685
She was getting ready to go back
to her family after she leaves

00:12:50.685 --> 00:12:53.055
Elizabeth and she's getting ready to.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.770
Basically be ridiculed.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.610
So what happened?

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.440
You're not married.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.410
How are you pregnant?

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.330
So now she's got to be bold in her faith.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.690
She's got to be confident in what
God's done and what God's promised.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.860
And so God was going to be mighty for
her, but then she was going to not

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.520
only have this baby, but then she was
going to have to raise Jesus, which

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.230
here's what we know Jesus was perfect.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.500
Right.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.710
So she, I wish we had some
Jesus children in our family.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.370
Um, but they probably wished that
they had some Jesus parents too.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.430
So, um, What I would still say with
this as is she was reminding herself

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.450
that God not only saved her and
chose her, but he would be mighty

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.940
for her through the whole process.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:40.260
See, I think Mary had a great reason to
give praise during the season of Christ

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.390
being born the first season of it.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:42.780
Right.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.560
She had a great reason
to give Christ praise.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.550
So some of the, some
parts of Christian faith.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:54.840
And I started thinking through this,
some, some parts really place Mary in a

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.930
high place, almost co-equals with Jesus.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.920
And as I begin to think through that,
if you want to know proof, whether

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.910
Mary should be equal with Jesus or
even right under Jesus won, when

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.660
it comes to celebrating her, the
truth is Mary gave us that answer.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.939
She said, no, I'm a humble servant.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.150
It's not about me, but
it's Christ be magnified.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.300
And so she even.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.750
Jesus above herself.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:19.800
And so, yes.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.150
Should we celebrate Mary's faith?

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:21.960
Absolutely.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.250
As we should celebrate one another's
faith, but we should not place Mary above

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.250
anyone or above Christ at all in this.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.400
And so she knew, um, to
give God praise in this.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.949
And so I thought it was amazing to
think through this before we continue

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:39.720
on Mason to think through this, what God
has done for everyone started with me.

00:14:40.785 --> 00:14:43.245
See God has provided salvation for us.

00:14:43.574 --> 00:14:47.564
God has chosen us to do great
and mighty things, and he will

00:14:47.564 --> 00:14:52.245
be mighty and strong through that
process of being a follower of him.

00:14:52.995 --> 00:14:54.345
And so it started with Mary.

00:14:54.345 --> 00:14:58.995
And so this is why Mary began to praise
God was what God had had done for her,

00:14:59.685 --> 00:15:02.025
but I love how she didn't stop there.

00:15:02.535 --> 00:15:07.515
You know, I think it's easy when God does
something for us to praise God for it.

00:15:07.845 --> 00:15:09.105
And thank God for it.

00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:13.170
Only about my, what God's done for me.

00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:17.250
And we forget about the rest, but Mary
didn't and I love how Mary didn't do that.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.310
And I'm gonna kinda jump a little
bit ahead in the morning, kind of

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.130
come back and address the second
part or the third part here.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.650
Um, but we're going to jump to verses
54 and 55 where Mary praise God for what

00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:30.750
he has done for the people of Israel.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.939
And so this is in 54 and 55.

00:15:32.939 --> 00:15:35.520
And so it says he has,
this is what God has done.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.939
He has helped his servant
Israel remembering his mercy.

00:15:39.515 --> 00:15:45.095
To Abraham and his descendants forever,
just as he spoke to our ancestors, see

00:15:45.095 --> 00:15:50.285
Mary had family and she had this family
that they would call the people of Israel.

00:15:50.285 --> 00:15:50.585
Right.

00:15:50.585 --> 00:15:53.885
And so if you go to the old Testament and
this is where, if you love history at all,

00:15:53.885 --> 00:15:55.324
you need to go read the old Testament.

00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:56.375
I used to hate it.

00:15:56.675 --> 00:15:57.215
Being honest.

00:15:57.215 --> 00:15:58.085
I used to hate the old Testament.

00:15:58.085 --> 00:15:58.775
I thought it was boring.

00:15:59.555 --> 00:16:02.765
Um, the more I started reading, I
realized that the Bible came to life

00:16:02.765 --> 00:16:04.115
when I understood the old Testament.

00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:06.155
And so God had stopped.

00:16:06.885 --> 00:16:10.395
This group of people that he
would call his people, uh, the

00:16:10.395 --> 00:16:12.375
people of Israel through Abraham.

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:17.895
And so this is where, where Mary's
recognizing God had a plan from

00:16:17.895 --> 00:16:19.755
the moment that he saved Abraham.

00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:25.395
He says, I will give you someone who
will one day save you from your sins.

00:16:25.395 --> 00:16:28.965
I will use, um, to, to save
the world from their sins.

00:16:28.965 --> 00:16:29.285
And so.

00:16:30.104 --> 00:16:34.604
Um, had, had done that through sending
Jesus and Mary recognized this,

00:16:34.604 --> 00:16:38.625
right, as she's looking at this,
it says that she recognized that he

00:16:38.625 --> 00:16:44.385
remembered his mercy to Abraham all
the way back to Abraham God remembered.

00:16:45.464 --> 00:16:47.385
And so it's finally coming true.

00:16:47.415 --> 00:16:51.015
Mary's recognizing this as, as
she's thinking through what God's

00:16:51.015 --> 00:16:54.704
done for her, Mary's recognizing
that God has came through for all

00:16:54.704 --> 00:16:56.685
of her people, all of her people.

00:16:56.685 --> 00:16:58.125
So she starts praising God for this.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:04.200
But if you think a little bit more into
this as is, is as the salvation came to

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.980
her people, she gave praise for them.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.349
I want to ask this question
when God blesses you.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.240
And so let's just think
through a couple of different

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.500
scenarios when God blesses you.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.950
If he provides financially for you,
if he's blessed you with life, if

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:23.089
he's blessed you with salvation,
do you believe that God's given

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:24.740
you that blessing just for you?

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:27.480
Absolutely.

00:17:28.555 --> 00:17:31.215
You look at what Mary's
example, Mary understood.

00:17:31.695 --> 00:17:32.625
Absolutely not.

00:17:32.655 --> 00:17:37.935
No, God has given this to my people
and I'm going to give him praise.

00:17:37.995 --> 00:17:39.795
And so whenever we receive a blessing.

00:17:40.814 --> 00:17:42.105
It's not only meant for us.

00:17:42.105 --> 00:17:44.745
And I always think about this as, so,
so you're saying if I get a hundred

00:17:44.745 --> 00:17:46.695
dollars, that a hundred dollars,
not just for me, I need to go.

00:17:46.695 --> 00:17:47.685
So give some of her way.

00:17:47.895 --> 00:17:51.014
I'm not necessarily saying that,
but what I am saying is when God

00:17:51.014 --> 00:17:53.415
provides for you, this is what
I love about Mary's testimony.

00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:57.435
At the very least you should be
sharing that testimony with others.

00:17:57.584 --> 00:18:02.264
So when God provides, when God heals,
when God gives wisdom or comfort

00:18:02.294 --> 00:18:07.395
or peace or salvation or hope it's
worth, uh, sharing that with others.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.080
They're saying, Hey, God
has done this for me.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.889
And so Mary recognized, God had done
that for somebody else, not just for her.

00:18:14.889 --> 00:18:17.949
And so she began to get praise
and that praise was recorded.

00:18:17.949 --> 00:18:18.250
Right.

00:18:19.959 --> 00:18:24.429
So as we think about this, we're been,
you know, we think about this hope that

00:18:24.429 --> 00:18:27.250
Mary was given was also given to us.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:27.520
Right.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.719
And so it's meant to give to us.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:35.170
I started thinking even just as a church,
why do we talk about giving, serving

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.940
and living your life out for Christ?

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:42.730
It's because we've recognized that nothing
that we do is only for us as a church.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.290
It's for our community.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.370
It's for our city, it's for our neighbors
as for our friends, it's for the world.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:53.890
And so we want to do everything we can
to, as God provides stories, a blessing.

00:18:54.615 --> 00:19:00.135
And, and providing hope and peace and
comfort that we give praise to God for it.

00:19:00.735 --> 00:19:03.435
And we get praise to God that he
gave it to us to give it to others.

00:19:04.095 --> 00:19:04.545
Amen.

00:19:05.715 --> 00:19:09.945
So this season reminds us of that,
and this is what Mary's praise

00:19:10.035 --> 00:19:13.245
reminds us of that, that she
recognized that it was for her people.

00:19:14.535 --> 00:19:17.505
And so that mentality that she
has should be that mentality for.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.160
So I want to take one step further.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.420
The hope that we've received.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.830
I want to be specific about this.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:26.940
The hope that we've received is not just
meant for us, it's meant for everyone.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.530
So if the hope that we receive
from Christ is meant for everyone.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.510
And this season of Christmas is one of
the greatest seasons to invite people

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:40.620
to church, because most people actually
love coming to church during Christmas.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.770
What should you go do today?

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:44.460
When you leave?

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.540
What should you do on Monday?

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:52.700
When you go to work, when you talk
to a neighbor or you go to your

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.110
kid's activity, what should you do?

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:54.770
Somebody told me,

00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.480
tell him about Jesus.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.210
Invite him to church, invite
him to experience that hope.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.270
Tell them about what God's been
doing in your life recently.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.860
And if you don't have something to
tell them, then what you can tell them.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.430
As Mary said, Because so many
times, I think we're wonder

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:14.720
what God's done for us lately.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.420
And I'll just tell you, God's done
way more than sometimes we recognize,

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.710
but if you struggle to figure out
what has God done for me, he's he's,

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.500
uh, you can take Mary's story and
say, Hey God provided for Mary.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.720
If he was mighty for Mary, he was
one who chose her and saved her.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.610
And he's given that to each one of us.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.900
So again, as we look at these
verses, Mary's reason to give

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.390
praise and the season of Christ.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:43.110
Was not only to give praise for what God
did for her or for the people of Israel,

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.830
but there's a bigger story that she
even speaks to, to give God praise for.

00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:50.370
And that's what God did for everyone.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:55.379
And we see this starting in verse 50,
it says his mercy is from generation

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.570
to generation on those who fear him.

00:20:58.139 --> 00:21:02.669
And so that means that generation and
generation is continuing on and on and on

00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:05.820
and on mercy is not giving us what we did.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.960
And so, so did V just a little bit
specific and talk just in a little bit

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.100
more in detail in this at the moment
that this world was created and God

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.520
created Adam and Eve, there was a
perfect relationship with God, right?

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.660
There was a perfect relationship with God.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:23.340
But lot of times the question always is,
is so why was the relationship broken?

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.200
You know, why didn't God create a man?

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.100
That would be perfect.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.640
Well, if God would create a man to
be perfect, and that moment, that

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.410
person has no control over their life.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.350
They're only controlled by
basically as like a robot.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:34.680
That's what.

00:21:35.835 --> 00:21:40.815
So because God gave us the freedom
of choosing him and choosing life,

00:21:41.055 --> 00:21:44.715
they chose wrong, marry or not
marry Adam and Eve chose wrong.

00:21:45.135 --> 00:21:49.695
And so they send, and so at that moment,
their relationship was broken, but God

00:21:50.025 --> 00:21:55.125
had a plan to send his son Jesus, to
bring that relationship back together.

00:21:55.725 --> 00:21:57.255
And so what is mercy?

00:21:57.255 --> 00:21:59.475
Mercy is not giving you what
you deserve, which is this.

00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:01.455
God could have said, you say.

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:07.125
No matter what happens from generation
to generation, you are doomed.

00:22:07.365 --> 00:22:09.285
You will never have a
relationship with me.

00:22:09.465 --> 00:22:13.995
You'll live apart from me in eternity,
apart from me and hell, but he didn't,

00:22:14.085 --> 00:22:18.135
he said, I want to give mercy, which
has not given you what you deserve.

00:22:18.675 --> 00:22:21.465
And I want to give you grace, which has
given you something you don't deserve

00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:23.205
as well, which is a relationship.

00:22:24.375 --> 00:22:27.255
And there's so much more to that
that I want to talk about, but

00:22:27.765 --> 00:22:30.555
just in thinking through this, God
has done this for everyone, right?

00:22:30.555 --> 00:22:32.685
And so we're going to read
verses 51 through 53 as well.

00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:35.505
So it says he has done a
mighty deed with his arm.

00:22:35.745 --> 00:22:38.325
He has scattered the proud because
of the thoughts of their hearts.

00:22:38.325 --> 00:22:41.985
He has toppled the mighty from
their Thrones and exalted lowly.

00:22:42.315 --> 00:22:46.125
He has satisfied the hungry with good
things, and he sent the rich away empty.

00:22:47.915 --> 00:22:52.865
So as we think through this,
he says, he's given mercy.

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:55.335
To generation to generation.

00:22:56.295 --> 00:22:58.485
What's the key word to receive that mercy.

00:22:59.805 --> 00:23:02.835
It says in verse 50, what's
the key word to receive mercy.

00:23:07.525 --> 00:23:09.535
So all those who fear him.

00:23:10.495 --> 00:23:13.345
So if you're anything like me and
you've studied the Bible and you

00:23:13.345 --> 00:23:16.875
see this where it says, you know, I
think it's in, uh, Proverbs nine, 10.

00:23:16.885 --> 00:23:19.075
It says the fear of the Lord
is the beginning of wisdom.

00:23:20.425 --> 00:23:21.445
I started going this.

00:23:21.475 --> 00:23:21.775
Okay.

00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:22.615
So I have to figure.

00:23:23.445 --> 00:23:25.725
So what does fear of the Lord mean?

00:23:25.725 --> 00:23:26.565
Somebody help me out here.

00:23:26.565 --> 00:23:27.585
What does fear of the Lord mean?

00:23:33.175 --> 00:23:34.495
Recognizing this wholeness?

00:23:34.705 --> 00:23:34.915
Okay.

00:23:35.485 --> 00:23:35.995
Reverence.

00:23:36.085 --> 00:23:36.355
Yeah.

00:23:38.155 --> 00:23:40.255
Anybody else want to add to that?

00:23:42.535 --> 00:23:42.745
Hmm.

00:23:44.425 --> 00:23:45.205
Respecting him.

00:23:45.235 --> 00:23:45.505
Yeah.

00:23:45.775 --> 00:23:46.555
For who he is.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.150
So when we look at it, you know, there's
a couple of different directions.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:54.770
And so I went and looked
in the dictionary, right?

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:59.810
So defines the dictionary, defines fear
as an unpleasant, often strong emotion

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:04.880
caused by anticipation or awareness of
danger, anxious, concern, unpleasant harm,

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:10.190
but it also notes that it means profound
reverence and awe, especially towards God.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.390
And so I think about this, it's
important for children to have

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.950
a healthy fear of their parents.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:21.030
Not a fear as though they're
cowering down, but a fear of

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.760
their authority in their lives.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:29.580
Because as we know as parents,
or maybe as adults, that we're a

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:34.230
little wiser than our kids are,
what's good and what's bad for them.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:41.250
And so we look at this, parents
can set the model of fear in

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.320
the Lord so that their kids.

00:24:44.745 --> 00:24:46.635
Respect you and fear you.

00:24:47.895 --> 00:24:50.655
I think sometimes we miss that as
parents or adults that we want our

00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:54.315
kids to respect us, but are we showing
respect to our heavenly father?

00:24:54.405 --> 00:25:00.225
Are we fearing him with the same authority
that we would want our kids to fear us?

00:25:01.245 --> 00:25:03.915
And I think that's a challenge to me
as I start thinking through that is, is

00:25:03.915 --> 00:25:08.445
that my teaching, my kids that I really
care about the Lord's place in my life.

00:25:08.475 --> 00:25:09.255
And so Mary.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.810
It's clearly saying here, his
mercy is from generation to

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:14.460
generation on those who fear him.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:20.460
So if the fear is a key component
in receiving God's mercy, and if

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.580
we believe that Mary received God's
mercy, which is what we believe here,

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.870
because it says that she was saved.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.940
I want to ask this question, how does
Mary's live show that she feared that.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.010
I know I'm trying to go deep here guys,
but I just want us to think through

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.790
how does Mary's life show that she
feared the Lord and received mercy.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:45.720
She chose to praise him.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.560
That's a good one.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.450
What else?

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.830
She shared boldly, right?

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.750
She was sharing her story.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:56.100
What else?

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.820
She humbled herself.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.080
That's another great, right.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.000
So she understood his authority.

00:26:06.139 --> 00:26:09.500
And so she placed herself under
it through humility, right.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.220
And her faith.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:15.169
And so to me, I'm, I'm, I'm
constantly, again, I tell you this

00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:18.560
a lot is I like this idea behind
like two plus two equals four.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.669
I like when things work out.

00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:23.840
And so not everything in our faith is
that easy, but I think whenever God

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.430
says to receive his mercy is to fear.

00:26:26.475 --> 00:26:28.035
And I'm like, what does
it look like to fear him?

00:26:28.035 --> 00:26:31.605
And Mary's given us an
example of faith and humility.

00:26:32.115 --> 00:26:35.865
And, um, what we would
say is praise right.

00:26:35.865 --> 00:26:38.205
And sharing what God's done for her.

00:26:38.805 --> 00:26:39.945
I go, okay.

00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:47.445
Then if I want to receive God's mercy,
then what does my life need to look like?

00:26:48.285 --> 00:26:50.325
And I think Mary set
that example up for me.

00:26:50.325 --> 00:26:54.615
So mercy is extended again
to generation to generation.

00:26:55.305 --> 00:26:57.105
If we fear God.

00:26:58.155 --> 00:27:02.985
And so God, Mary mentions in
this three different people

00:27:03.135 --> 00:27:04.755
who God is merciful towards.

00:27:04.755 --> 00:27:08.355
And it's interesting as he begins, she
begins to explain this, uh, in verse

00:27:08.385 --> 00:27:13.065
51, it says he has done mighty deed with
his arm and he has scattered the proud

00:27:13.185 --> 00:27:14.475
because of the thoughts of their heart.

00:27:14.535 --> 00:27:17.625
And so these are the helpless
that he's extended mercy to.

00:27:18.255 --> 00:27:22.605
Then we see in verse 52, that he
has toppled the mighty from their

00:27:22.605 --> 00:27:24.105
Thrones and exalted the little.

00:27:24.765 --> 00:27:27.285
And so we see this as the humble people.

00:27:28.245 --> 00:27:33.285
And then we look at verse 53 and he has
satisfied the hungry with good things

00:27:33.285 --> 00:27:35.355
and sent away the rich away empty.

00:27:35.775 --> 00:27:38.475
And so he extends mercy to the hungry.

00:27:39.195 --> 00:27:44.265
So as a society, the question
is, do we tend to celebrate

00:27:44.535 --> 00:27:47.405
the helpless and the hungry.

00:27:50.129 --> 00:27:52.649
I mean, we have concern for them,
but I don't think we celebrate

00:27:52.649 --> 00:27:56.429
them as though they're people that
receive something amazing like mercy.

00:27:57.929 --> 00:28:00.510
No, typically we, we celebrate
the strong and the ones who

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.679
can take care of themselves.

00:28:01.709 --> 00:28:05.939
We sh we celebrate those who are maybe
prideful or boastful in a strong position.

00:28:06.419 --> 00:28:12.240
We're richer, powerful, but no, God
says those who recognize their need,

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.659
the helpless, the humble, the huh.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.209
Are the ones that will receive mercy.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.840
I don't know if you associated
with any of these groups at all.

00:28:22.709 --> 00:28:25.590
Um, but if you do you have
much to get praised for because

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.120
you recognize your need.

00:28:28.229 --> 00:28:29.729
It's a great reason to give praise.

00:28:29.729 --> 00:28:32.370
And I started just thinking through
that briefly mercy to receive

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:36.719
God's mercy is to recognize who
God is, recognize your needs.

00:28:36.719 --> 00:28:40.740
So you may not be helpless,
humble, or hungry, but if in

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:41.669
somewhere in there that you are.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.040
Recognize your need.

00:28:44.189 --> 00:28:46.530
You do get to receive God's mercy.

00:28:47.189 --> 00:28:51.780
And I think of it this way before we
conclude sort of thinking a little bit

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:57.570
more about this is what's our part in
receiving God's mercy or our salvation.

00:28:57.629 --> 00:29:00.510
When we think about Mary what's
our part, because you know,

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.919
doesn't God do everything right.

00:29:01.919 --> 00:29:03.929
We don't work for our salvation.

00:29:03.959 --> 00:29:07.830
Everything is given to us by
grace, through grace, in faith.

00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:11.639
And so a lot of times, I dunno, I
dunno if you ever think about this.

00:29:13.185 --> 00:29:14.355
What must I do.

00:29:15.195 --> 00:29:22.575
And in the end we realized that mercy,
grace forgiveness is always there

00:29:22.635 --> 00:29:31.095
waiting on us, not to do anything,
but to receive it, to say, I need

00:29:31.095 --> 00:29:38.025
it to recognize my humble, helpless,
hungry condition, and a need for God.

00:29:38.775 --> 00:29:40.665
See Mary understood.

00:29:41.995 --> 00:29:46.375
And this season for her, the first
season of Christ's birth birth, that

00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:52.415
she could give God praise for her
salvation, but she could also give praise

00:29:52.415 --> 00:29:56.945
for the salvation of her people, but
she could give salvation so that every

00:29:56.945 --> 00:29:58.745
generation could come to know Christ.

00:29:59.705 --> 00:30:00.245
Oh man.

00:30:00.275 --> 00:30:02.555
You know what so cool in this moment.

00:30:02.645 --> 00:30:05.675
And these are the things that
like blow my mind in this moment.

00:30:06.215 --> 00:30:07.235
Mary Gay pray.

00:30:09.405 --> 00:30:16.575
For the salvation that we receive today,
like she gave praise in advance to God.

00:30:16.575 --> 00:30:17.294
For what?

00:30:18.014 --> 00:30:20.024
When you gave your life to
Christ, when you gave your life

00:30:20.024 --> 00:30:23.595
to Christ and that moment Mary
had given praise that long ago.

00:30:23.625 --> 00:30:25.125
That's a cool picture.

00:30:26.955 --> 00:30:31.784
What are you praising God for
now that maybe somebody two

00:30:31.784 --> 00:30:34.274
months, two years, 200 years will.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.160
I'll tell you this, Mary set,
a great example of what the

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.380
season of praise can be for us.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:46.570
And so we see Mary's reason to get
praise during this season of Christ's

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:50.050
birth was for what God did for
her, what God did for the people of

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.760
Israel and what God did for everyone.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.260
So what's our reason for giving God
praise during the season of Christmas.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:58.950
You're not going to be shocked by it.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.450
It's the same thing.

00:31:01.379 --> 00:31:05.939
It's the same reason we can give God
praise during the season is exactly

00:31:05.939 --> 00:31:10.169
the same reason that Mary gave praise
because of what God has done for us.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.169
He sent Jesus to be
the savior of our life.

00:31:14.159 --> 00:31:16.169
He didn't just save us, you
know, always, still be with us.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.810
God, didn't just save us from something.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.209
He saved us for something.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:30.149
So he chose us to do what, do what Mary
did to give him praise, to tell her story.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.159
To live her life out
through faith in humility.

00:31:36.179 --> 00:31:37.860
See, God has done that for us.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.419
And then he's given us
the power to fulfill it.

00:31:39.419 --> 00:31:41.370
He says, I'm not going to leave
you there to figure this out.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:43.980
I'm going to save you and choose you.

00:31:44.219 --> 00:31:45.360
And now I'm going to give you wisdom.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:50.010
How does he give us wisdom through
his word, through each other, right on

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:55.620
how to live in such a way that helps
other people know him in this season.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.929
We can not only praise God
for what he's done for us, but

00:31:57.929 --> 00:31:59.070
what he's done all around us.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.639
And so I'll just say.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.620
We can give God praise for what he's done
here and inspiring hope we can get God

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.270
praise for what he's done in our city.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:11.070
We give God praise for the connections
that we've been making in, in our lives.

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.250
We can give God praise that,
that he has come to save, not

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.950
just us, but those all around us.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:24.460
Lastly, we can give God praise in
this season because he's extended his

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.320
mercy from generation to generation.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.820
If I think about the individually.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:32.340
And the generations that's
going to come after me guys.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:38.760
I'm telling you this, I can't wait
for one day to get to heaven and

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.830
realize the impact of our faith here
as a church and as individuals, as

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:47.520
impacted generations after us, I
want to be a part of that story.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.890
Can we give praise for
that during the season?

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.790
Absolutely.

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.970
Mary taught us that
it's not just about us.

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:57.150
It's about his kingdom from
generation to generation.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.800
So as we close today, I just want
you to consider during this time of

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.629
reflection, a couple of questions,
and one of those questions during

00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:08.100
this time of reflection is this.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:10.320
And I kind of alluded to at the beginning.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:12.990
I want you to ask yourself this question.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:17.010
Have I put other things ahead of
celebrating what Christ has done for me

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.889
during the season during Christmas, it
is easy to get so focused on everything.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.690
And then all of a sudden it's
Christmas morning and we tell

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:30.680
the kids, Hey, don't forget.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.030
It's Jesus's birthday.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.150
And then we opened our
gifts and we move on.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.340
And guys just so you
know, I love Christmas.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.300
I love opening gifts.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.710
I love buying gifts for our kids.

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:43.100
I don't like paying the bill, but
I like buying kids' gifts for kids.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:48.770
Um, I, I love the smells
and the lights I'm for it.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.080
I just really am.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.500
Um, but I'm, I I'm reminded.

00:33:55.945 --> 00:33:58.495
That I'm more for Christ
than I am for anything else.

00:33:59.155 --> 00:34:00.804
So I want you to just ask
yourself this question.

00:34:00.804 --> 00:34:03.145
Have I gotten things out of order?

00:34:03.985 --> 00:34:06.175
You know, am I celebrating Christ's birth?

00:34:06.715 --> 00:34:10.735
And then everything that I do I
see through the lenses of that.

00:34:10.735 --> 00:34:12.955
And if, and if you haven't, it's
not like you're sitting here to

00:34:12.955 --> 00:34:14.185
say, oh, I'm such a horrible person.

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:16.255
It's just saying, Hey, I
want to get that right today.

00:34:16.824 --> 00:34:20.455
So I would just ask you during this
time of reflection, God, have I

00:34:20.455 --> 00:34:23.455
placed things in this season ahead of.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:28.439
And if, and if you have just ask
God to help you now prioritize him

00:34:28.439 --> 00:34:29.850
and make him a part of the season.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.500
Um, just a couple of examples for you
guys, for us as a family, we've grown in

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:39.689
this, um, since we've had kids, um, one of
the first things that we put up as an ad.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:40.980
Calendar.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:45.029
Uh, we, we read through this and we,
we open up this and we read the story

00:34:45.029 --> 00:34:49.259
and, and we talk about Christ and we
prioritize Christ throughout this.

00:34:49.259 --> 00:34:53.190
We, we actually typically make a cake on
Christmas morning and we block candles

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.359
and we celebrate Christ's birthday.

00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:57.270
We, we talk about it
through the seasons, right?

00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:00.089
So we're, we're trying to do
whatever we can to teach our kids

00:35:00.089 --> 00:35:03.859
this, whatever we do in this.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:08.939
It's more than just the gifts you're
going to open up on in the morning

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:10.680
or the great cookies that you love.

00:35:11.339 --> 00:35:14.370
It is such a bigger story
of what God's done for us.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.480
So I want you to ask yourself that
question, but the second one is this.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.589
I want you to ask this question.

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:22.740
Have I ever given my life to
Jesus to actually celebrate

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.029
the true reason why Jesus came?

00:35:24.959 --> 00:35:29.850
Because this season of Christmas
is, is nothing apart from Christ.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:34.140
And really if we don't have a relationship
with Christ, Can we really celebrate

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:39.420
the true reason why the season is
even here and that again, that's for

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.970
you to ask God, is that my next step?

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.040
Have I truly given my life to Christ?

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:49.230
And if you have praise God, um,
Lee into the season, thank God for

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.710
what he's done, because without
this season we aren't saved.

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:53.850
We don't have a savior.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:55.680
What we do have a savior to say.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.660
So when this time of reflection,
I want you to do this.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:04.220
If you have questions about what it means
to give your life to Christ, come see me.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.620
I'm going to hang out in the back of
the hand, in the back for this purpose.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:10.009
I want you to say, Hey, there's something
that spoke to me in this message that I

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.710
have questions about, or this, something
that spoke to me in this message.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:13.730
That's leading to me to this.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:17.060
I need to give my life to Christ and
you don't have to have all the answers

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.569
because if I had to have all the
answers at the moment of salvation,

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.620
I probably still wouldn't be saved
because there's so many things.

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:27.090
And some of it just comes with faith.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.810
And so today, maybe it's you, maybe it's
you needing to give your life to Christ.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:34.710
And if it is come talk to me, don't
let another day pass before you

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.120
don't give your life to Christ.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:41.280
You're missing this amazing
relationship that Mary teaches us,

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.490
that Mary was able to give praise.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.260
And I want you to be able to get
praised in the season more than

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.940
just, you know, all the other
things that are part of Christmas.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.940
As you reflect and consider,
ask the Lord what he's teaching.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.670
You, give it to him.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.770
And if you haven't given your
life to Christ, come talk to me.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:05.760
I'd love to talk with you.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.130
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:08.910
We love you, Lord.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.010
We're thankful for today.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:18.330
As we begin the season of praise,
or I think I was reminded by my

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.310
wife this morning, Lord, about.

00:37:21.675 --> 00:37:27.015
Um, there's, there's more than just
this season to give praise and, um,

00:37:27.045 --> 00:37:28.485
Lord, we should get praise every day.

00:37:28.485 --> 00:37:35.535
No matter what day it is, Lord, we've
taken time out, um, to dedicate this

00:37:35.535 --> 00:37:44.805
time, Lord, to, um, giving praise to
say thank you because we were helpless.

00:37:46.185 --> 00:37:50.625
We were hopeless and you didn't leave.

00:37:51.735 --> 00:37:56.595
But you sent your son Jesus to
give us hope, Lord, to give us

00:37:56.595 --> 00:38:02.805
peace, to give us wisdom and
direction and purpose in our lives.

00:38:04.545 --> 00:38:08.865
So Lord, I just pray that Lord
whoever's in this room, Lord,

00:38:08.865 --> 00:38:09.975
whatever's on their heart.

00:38:10.305 --> 00:38:13.095
Whatever they're going to surrender
to you Lord, during this time,

00:38:13.095 --> 00:38:17.775
I pray that you or draw them to
that you give them encouragement.

00:38:19.214 --> 00:38:23.384
And, um, Lord that each person will
leave out of here, challenged, uh,

00:38:23.415 --> 00:38:27.415
to make you the center of everything
that we do during the season.

00:38:27.794 --> 00:38:30.285
But Lord, I also pray if there's
someone in this room that doesn't

00:38:30.285 --> 00:38:33.524
know you, Lord, that today, they will
choose to give their lives to you.

00:38:33.524 --> 00:38:36.615
That they'll take that step of faith,
even if they don't have all the answers

00:38:36.615 --> 00:38:41.565
Lord, and they'll begin to walk in
a relationship with you and get to

00:38:41.565 --> 00:38:43.395
experience the season in such a new way.

00:38:44.174 --> 00:38:45.794
And so Lord, we just pray
this in your heavenly name.
