00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.350
Alright, we're going to go
ahead and jump in today.

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:11.489
So, we're super excited about today.

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.190
We get the opportunity to...

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.369
Uh, start a new series, which I
may be crazy for starting on a

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.640
holiday weekend, start a new series.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.300
But I'm going to start a new series
and then, uh, those who miss it

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.700
will have to go back and catch up.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.259
So you guys are lucky you
get to be here on day one.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.059
Uh, before I continue to talk
about that series, I'm going

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:30.899
to pass around something.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.270
I figured out this is
the best way to do it.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.310
So we are doing something
called a Fall Fun Fest.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.010
If you were with us last year, we did this
in partnership with Riverview Elementary.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.210
Um, it was a great event, we had over 700
people show up, um, they loved it so much

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.940
that they requested, they like begged
us, will you come back and do this again?

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.760
So that's awesome.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.310
Uh, so we're going to be doing
it on a Tuesday night, September

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.389
19th, um, and we need to know if
you can help us, it'll be from 5.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.650
30pm, and the greatest way for
you to tell us that you can help

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.140
is by putting your name down.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.840
Um, and so I'm just going to
start this around over here.

00:01:04.194 --> 00:01:06.995
You guys can just help it get around
to every person, and when it gets

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:09.755
done, you can just end it somewhere up
here on the front, and I'll grab it.

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:12.855
Um, but please, please, please, if
you have the ability to come out and

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:16.545
serve, even if it's an hour, and help
us put this on, uh, we would love it.

00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:19.645
So what you do is just put your name
down, then we'll reach out to you and

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:21.594
let you know what we need help with.

00:01:21.594 --> 00:01:26.875
We'll have cook food, to popcorn, to
wash inflatables, to help face paint,

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:30.725
to put on games and activities, but
it's a great way to serve our community.

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:33.075
Um, so I'd love for you to
sign up and be a part of that.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.160
Um, but today we're starting a
new series in the book of Genesis.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.180
And if you're wondering, are we
going to go through the whole

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.540
book of Genesis before we stop?

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.650
No, we're actually going to cover the
first 11 chapters of Genesis between

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.859
now and the end of the year, which
may even still seem like a daunting

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.689
task and a little bit of it really is.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.990
Um, but we're going to start
with the first 11 chapters.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.480
We'll take a little bit of a break,
um, and do a few other series,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.760
um, at the beginning of next year.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.270
We'll jump back in and
cover some more of Genesis.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.970
Eventually, over the next year and
a half, my hope is that we finish.

00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:04.425
The whole book of Genesis.

00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:06.615
And so I hope this is
very informational to you.

00:02:06.965 --> 00:02:10.264
Um, it's one that has been
on my heart for a while.

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:12.404
If you've talked to me at
all, you've probably heard me

00:02:12.404 --> 00:02:13.815
talk about this in January.

00:02:14.324 --> 00:02:15.625
It is now September.

00:02:15.824 --> 00:02:18.244
It's taken me that long to convince
myself that we can do this.

00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:19.994
We can go through the book of Genesis.

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:24.194
And so, um, I have found as I've been
studying, because it has taken me that

00:02:24.194 --> 00:02:28.984
much time, Uh, that there is a multiple
ways to preach the book of Genesis.

00:02:28.984 --> 00:02:29.774
There's some people...

00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:31.424
There's some people that will
preach through it in one sermon.

00:02:31.635 --> 00:02:33.994
There's some people that
will preach through chapter

00:02:33.994 --> 00:02:36.304
one over a six week series.

00:02:36.834 --> 00:02:40.445
Um, so you can tell there's a
variety of ways to dive into the

00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:45.174
book of Genesis and really understand
basically the way to go through it.

00:02:45.504 --> 00:02:47.515
And so I just came to a
couple of conclusions.

00:02:47.515 --> 00:02:48.364
I don't want to share these with you.

00:02:48.364 --> 00:02:50.094
Finally I came to the
conclusion on a few things.

00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:54.024
Number one, I do not, nor you
do not, have as much time.

00:02:54.584 --> 00:02:58.605
As it takes to cover every single
detail of every single verse in the

00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:00.554
theme of Genesis, we just don't.

00:03:01.084 --> 00:03:04.545
Um, and so because of that, we're
gonna take a different route.

00:03:04.595 --> 00:03:07.714
Um, and so I also learned that as a
pastor of a church, in a church plant,

00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:10.644
in the multiple roles I play, you
probably don't want me spending 30

00:03:10.644 --> 00:03:14.435
to 40 hours a week just to give you
a verse by verse breakdown so that we

00:03:14.435 --> 00:03:17.225
can cover every aspect of 6 to 8 years.

00:03:17.554 --> 00:03:20.234
Um, so I figured valuing
my time, your time.

00:03:20.984 --> 00:03:25.334
And looking really at the key
idea of why was this book wrote

00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:27.165
is probably a better route to go.

00:03:27.524 --> 00:03:30.065
Um, and so we're going
to really focus on this.

00:03:30.524 --> 00:03:33.084
Transformation over information.

00:03:33.294 --> 00:03:35.584
And so what I mean by this, we're going
to learn a lot of information today.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:37.734
You're probably going to leave
here going, ah, I learned something

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:39.755
new about chapter one of Genesis.

00:03:40.114 --> 00:03:43.125
Um, but what I would say is that
information that we gain really needs

00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:44.855
to be turned into transformation.

00:03:44.855 --> 00:03:48.614
And if we're only focusing on information,
it will add no value to our lives.

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.690
So that's kind of how we're
looking at this book today.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.390
Um, because I really wanna set us up well.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.780
Um, and I know how gifted,
I'm not in a lot of areas.

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.740
Um, I go to other resources and if
anybody heard of the Bible Project.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.940
Okay.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.540
A couple of you.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.900
Well, today I'm gonna start off with
the video from the Bible Project

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.209
a little longer than what I would
typically show you in a sermon,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.190
but I think this will help you.

00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:16.204
and me be ready for Genesis as
a whole, but really even just

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:18.355
this first chapter in Genesis.

00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:21.704
So we're going to dive into this, watch
this video, once it gets done, I'm

00:04:21.704 --> 00:04:24.925
going to jump up and we're going to walk
through the first chapter of Genesis.

00:04:24.925 --> 00:04:25.435
So let's go.

00:04:34.554 --> 00:04:38.425
The first book in the Bible is called
Genesis, and we're going to look closely

00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:40.215
at the first page of the book of Genesis.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.900
It's a carefully crafted
narrative about God creating

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.880
and ordering the whole cosmos.

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.120
Okay, let's check it out.

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.260
Now, the opening line of the whole
Bible is, In the beginning, God

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.200
created the skies and the land.

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:57.609
Now, your Bible translation might
say, The heavens and the earth.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.800
In Biblical Hebrew, the word for
heaven refers simply to the sky above.

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:06.024
And the word for earth does not
mean globe, but rather, the land.

00:05:06.435 --> 00:05:07.495
The ground below us.

00:05:07.645 --> 00:05:08.065
Right.

00:05:08.094 --> 00:05:12.604
This line is summarizing what's going
to happen in the following narrative,

00:05:12.844 --> 00:05:14.515
which starts in the next line.

00:05:14.755 --> 00:05:18.824
And it reads, Now the
land was wild and waste.

00:05:19.255 --> 00:05:20.994
This phrase rhymes in Hebrew.

00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:26.224
The land was tohu vavohu, which
means unordered and uninhabited.

00:05:26.715 --> 00:05:30.174
This is the ancient way of talking
about the pre creation state.

00:05:30.354 --> 00:05:32.255
What we might call nothingness.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.940
For the biblical authors, non existence
means having no purpose and no order.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.149
And the next line uses another
image to say the same thing.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.710
And darkness was on the
face of the deep abyss.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.729
What's the deep abyss?

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.259
Yeah, it's a dark, chaotic ocean.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.580
It's another common way the
ancients described the non

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.700
reality that preceded creation.

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.789
Now, here's where things start to get
interesting, because in the midst of

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.039
those dark waters, God is present.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.919
And the Spirit of God was hovering
over the face of the waters.

00:06:06.049 --> 00:06:10.940
The Hebrew word for God's spirit is
ruach, which can refer to wind, or

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.239
breath, or God's invisible presence.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.219
So you can't see it, but God is
present, in the darkness, ready to

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:19.380
bring order, so that life can flourish.

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:22.020
Yes, and this ordering
happens in a series.

00:06:23.705 --> 00:06:26.735
Each day begins with the
phrase, and God said.

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:30.775
And then ends with the phrase,
and there was evening and morning.

00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:34.764
Yeah, every day addresses those
problems introduced in verse two.

00:06:34.985 --> 00:06:37.295
That there's no order, and no inhabitants.

00:06:37.805 --> 00:06:41.435
So, on days one through three,
God splits apart that unordered

00:06:41.474 --> 00:06:43.265
darkness into three ordered realms.

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:49.310
Then, on days four through six, God fills
the uninhabited wasteland with creatures.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.120
Interesting.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.349
Let's see how that works.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.820
Okay.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.389
So, the first realm of order
begins with light on day one.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.999
Ah, yes.

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:57.729
Let there be light.

00:06:58.179 --> 00:06:59.529
This is God's own glorious...

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:11.739
Okay, and then on day two, let
there be a vault between the waters

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.429
to separate water from water.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.979
What's the fault?

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:19.070
In the ancient culture of the biblical
authors, the sky was perceived as a

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.289
solid dome that holds back waters.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.170
God's depicted here as splitting
the chaos waters in half, above

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.310
and below, which creates the
realms of the sky and the seas.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.170
And then on day three, let the waters
under the sky be gathered into one

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.310
place and let dry ground appear.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.250
God is establishing the realm of the land,
and it emerges out of the chaotic waters.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.490
And then there's a bonus
creative act on day three.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.350
God invites plants and fruit trees
with seed to emerge out of the land.

00:07:50.609 --> 00:07:54.160
Okay, so we've got the realms
of time, the realm of the sky

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.580
and the seas, and the land.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.640
And they all have order.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.220
Right.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.210
Now, it's time to go back and
fill these realms of days 1

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.610
through 3 with inhabitants.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.049
This is what happens on days 4 through 6.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.780
So on day 4, let there be
lights in the vaults of the sky.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.290
God installs these lights, the
sun, moon, and stars, as signs and

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.830
symbols that reflect God's own light.

00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:22.360
He gives them his own royal
power to separate day and night.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.190
Then on day five, let the waters
swarm with living creatures, and

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.339
let birds fly above the land.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.939
Yeah, these are the creatures that
live in the waters below, and those

00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:33.809
that fly near the waters above.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.025
Then finally on day six, Let the
land produce living creatures.

00:08:38.355 --> 00:08:41.325
They emerge out of the
ground to live on the land.

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:47.035
And then, matching that bonus act of
creation on Day 3, God makes a special

00:08:47.045 --> 00:08:50.354
land creature, human, or in Hebrew, Adam.

00:08:51.125 --> 00:08:55.805
Then, God provides all of those
plants from Day 3 as abundant food.

00:08:56.375 --> 00:09:00.445
Now, over and over, God says
what he created was good.

00:09:00.475 --> 00:09:05.024
But then, after making humans,
God says that it is very good.

00:09:05.335 --> 00:09:06.045
Yes.

00:09:06.075 --> 00:09:10.184
Humanity is the climax of days one
through six, and their importance is

00:09:10.184 --> 00:09:12.854
explained in the first poem in the Bible.

00:09:12.874 --> 00:09:15.445
So God created humanity in his own image.

00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:17.535
In the image of God, he created them.

00:09:17.655 --> 00:09:19.715
Male and female, he created them.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.860
So, humans come up from the ground,
like the other land creatures.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.270
But they're also born.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.790
They're God's image.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.180
Which means that, together, men
and women embody and represent

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.280
the creator within his creation.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.410
God blessed them, and said, Be fruitful,
and increase in number, fill the earth,

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.070
and soon do it, ruling over the creatures.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.480
This is the purpose of being God's image.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.189
To oversee creation as God's
partners and representatives.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:49.450
The world.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:49.990
Very cool.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:54.190
Now, after the six days, we get a
concluding line that links back to

00:09:54.195 --> 00:09:58.810
the keywords of the opening line,
and so we're completed the skies and

00:09:58.815 --> 00:10:02.350
the land and all their inhabitants,
except there's one more day.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.500
It stands outside the pattern
of days one through six.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.090
It's the big climax, and God completed
on the seventh day, the work which he

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.831
had done, and he rested on the seventh.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.240
day from all the work which he had
done, and God blessed the seventh

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.360
day, and set it apart as holy.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.580
So God rests on the seventh day.

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:25.700
This is a standard biblical image where
God, after ordering the cosmos, comes

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.820
to rest and dwell in his sacred space.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.150
It's like the whole world is a holy
temple where God lives with his people.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.790
Now that phrase, there was evening and
morning, it doesn't appear on day seven.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:39.600
That's right.

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:41.619
The seventh day has no end.

00:10:42.255 --> 00:10:46.825
That's because Genesis 1 is describing
God's ideal vision for the whole cosmos.

00:10:47.665 --> 00:10:52.724
A place where God lives with his partners
to rule the world in harmony forever.

00:10:52.925 --> 00:10:55.875
Yes, the seventh day is
the goal of creation.

00:10:55.944 --> 00:10:59.795
It's actually so important that the
author of Genesis 1 has woven the number

00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:02.035
seven into every part of the story.

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:03.665
There are seven days of creation.

00:11:04.055 --> 00:11:06.185
Seven announcements that creation is good.

00:11:06.705 --> 00:11:10.715
There are seven Hebrew words in the
opening verse, and then two times

00:11:10.725 --> 00:11:12.455
seven Hebrew words in verse two.

00:11:12.985 --> 00:11:17.435
And then, the statement about the seventh
day has three lines of seven words.

00:11:18.415 --> 00:11:18.705
Wow.

00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:21.694
So, the first page of the Bible
is doing way more than just

00:11:21.715 --> 00:11:23.675
telling us how the world was made.

00:11:23.805 --> 00:11:24.215
Right.

00:11:24.215 --> 00:11:28.185
Genesis 1 has been designed to
show us that God's purpose is to

00:11:28.185 --> 00:11:30.205
share creation with His images.

00:11:30.685 --> 00:11:33.415
So they can rest and
rule it with him forever.

00:11:33.825 --> 00:11:37.615
And that purpose is what the rest
of the biblical drama is all about.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.490
Alright, so you may be wondering why
am I even preaching if I just showed

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.040
you the whole story of chapter one.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.760
Here's what I know.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.570
Number one, um, the
repetition is important.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.179
I think we'll draw on a couple
of different things as we

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.480
walk through this as well.

00:11:56.869 --> 00:11:59.329
Uh, but there's something about that
visual element when I've watched this

00:11:59.329 --> 00:12:02.900
video that I, whenever I watch it, I was
like, man, this is so valuable for me.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.100
And then I'm like, why would I withhold
that from our church to be able to see

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.620
that before we really dive into this?

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.760
And so there's, there's a lot
that has to deal with Genesis 1.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.050
Um, and we're not going to actually
deal with the seventh day because the

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.480
seventh day actually starts in Genesis 2.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.589
We're actually going to take a whole week
and talk about that day of rest next week.

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:21.300
Um, and so come ready for that.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.930
And so, as we dive into this,
I'm not going to just read

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:24.909
all the way through chapter 1.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.679
We're actually just going to do
it as I'm preaching through this

00:12:26.689 --> 00:12:27.680
to make it a little bit simpler.

00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:31.350
But I want to give a little bit of the
background when we think about this book.

00:12:31.699 --> 00:12:36.324
Um, when we look at this book, Um,
many scholars believe that Moses

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:37.555
is the one that wrote this book.

00:12:37.555 --> 00:12:40.584
And so if you, uh, know a little
bit about, uh, the, the books, the

00:12:40.584 --> 00:12:44.064
Bible, the first five books, the
Bible are called the Law or the Torah.

00:12:44.125 --> 00:12:47.125
Some call it the Pentateuch, which
is a weird, really weird name.

00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:50.875
But basically it's the first five books
that most believe and attribute Moses

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:53.185
as the one that writes these books.

00:12:53.395 --> 00:12:55.194
Um, and Moses is from Exodus.

00:12:55.194 --> 00:12:59.995
If you guys remember, he helped, um, the
Israelites lead Egypt out of slavery,

00:13:00.084 --> 00:13:01.285
and that's the second book of the Bible.

00:13:01.285 --> 00:13:02.035
And so many believe.

00:13:02.719 --> 00:13:06.239
That Moses is the one that would have
wrote this book in order to help the

00:13:06.239 --> 00:13:10.410
people of Israel remember who created
them and what they were created for.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.339
Um, and when we really even dive a
little bit deeper into that idea of who

00:13:15.339 --> 00:13:18.929
created them and what they were created
for, I think that's a question that

00:13:18.929 --> 00:13:20.779
people are asking in today's society.

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:24.609
I think those are questions that we're
asking at times about why we were

00:13:24.609 --> 00:13:26.640
created and who truly created us.

00:13:27.055 --> 00:13:28.225
What's our purpose?

00:13:28.225 --> 00:13:32.055
And so I think that this is really
important to go to that idea, that idea

00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:33.705
of why Moses would have wrote this book.

00:13:33.705 --> 00:13:36.985
And so some ask this question, well,
how did Moses, if Moses wasn't there

00:13:36.985 --> 00:13:39.145
in the beginning, how did Moses know?

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:40.764
What to write?

00:13:41.194 --> 00:13:41.895
What was there?

00:13:41.895 --> 00:13:43.344
And so, there's a couple
of different ways.

00:13:43.344 --> 00:13:45.824
Now, some would say that it's
by revelation of God that

00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:47.334
he had given him the wisdom.

00:13:47.704 --> 00:13:50.204
Um, and speaking it to him
in some form or fashion.

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:53.884
Some would say also it would be passed
down from generation to generation.

00:13:54.194 --> 00:13:57.794
I don't care where you land, we
got the book of Genesis and we got

00:13:57.844 --> 00:14:00.404
it, um, most likely from Moses.

00:14:00.764 --> 00:14:03.644
Um, and so we're gonna kinda
walk through this in that light.

00:14:03.685 --> 00:14:04.864
Right, that light of understanding.

00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:10.979
of who created us and the world that we
live in and what were we created for.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.839
So the first two verses is what
we'll kind of focus on right now.

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:17.349
It says, In the beginning God created
the heavens and the earth, and now

00:14:17.349 --> 00:14:22.429
the earth was formless and empty, and
darkness covered the surface of the

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:27.310
watery depths, and the Spirit of God was
hovering over the surface of the waters.

00:14:27.729 --> 00:14:30.979
And so when we look at this, I
believe that verse number one

00:14:30.979 --> 00:14:33.219
is a key verse in our lives.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.000
Here's why I believe it is.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.430
If we can't believe verse 1 of
the Bible, then we really can't

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.790
believe the rest of the Bible.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:41.360
Now, I'm going to say that again.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.640
If we can't believe verse 1 of the
Bible, we cannot believe the rest

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.420
of the Bible, which means this.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.590
In the beginning, God created.

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:49.880
And you know, in society, we
deal with this struggle honestly.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.364
If your kids are in school, they will be
taught something completely different.

00:14:53.765 --> 00:14:54.775
That God created.

00:14:55.285 --> 00:14:58.535
Uh, and, and I'm not here necessarily
to wrestle through that today, but I

00:14:58.535 --> 00:15:01.935
do believe that if we can't believe
that God created, we probably can't

00:15:01.935 --> 00:15:03.955
believe anything else in the Word.

00:15:04.334 --> 00:15:07.105
And that's a struggle at times for
some of us, because there's some verses

00:15:07.105 --> 00:15:08.794
that we go, it just doesn't make sense.

00:15:09.155 --> 00:15:13.235
And I will just tell you this, there's
a lot of things that we will not fully

00:15:13.235 --> 00:15:16.165
understand this side of Heaven, but I
believe when we look at this verse, in

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:20.125
the beginning, God created is the most
important verse that we believe first.

00:15:20.504 --> 00:15:22.795
And if we don't believe that
first, the question is...

00:15:23.445 --> 00:15:26.025
At what point in the Bible
do you begin believing?

00:15:26.065 --> 00:15:28.455
Which means this, at what point
in the Bible are we going to take

00:15:28.495 --> 00:15:30.445
out before we start believing?

00:15:30.745 --> 00:15:32.645
And that is a tough question to ask.

00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:36.825
And so by faith, because none
of us were there, we believe

00:15:36.845 --> 00:15:38.744
that God created the earth.

00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:40.525
And so we can't pick and choose.

00:15:40.525 --> 00:15:43.345
And I really want to read this briefly,
I'm going to try to be brief as I can.

00:15:43.775 --> 00:15:45.805
Um, there's a reason why I would say we...

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:49.459
We shouldn't question God on
creation, and Job went through

00:15:49.459 --> 00:15:54.040
this, as many people may be familiar
with the story or the book of Job.

00:15:54.479 --> 00:15:58.449
Job had kind of questioned God and
what God was doing, and here's what God

00:15:58.449 --> 00:16:01.369
said to Job in his questioning of him.

00:16:01.709 --> 00:16:03.759
And I'm just going to read this, this
is not going to be up on your screen,

00:16:04.099 --> 00:16:07.939
but I'm just going to read verses, uh,
it's from Job 38, verses 4 through 18.

00:16:08.339 --> 00:16:11.329
And this is God speaking to Job, and
this is what he said, Where were you,

00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:13.579
Job, when I established the earth?

00:16:14.115 --> 00:16:19.055
He says, tell me if you have
understanding, who fixed its dimensions.

00:16:19.215 --> 00:16:24.385
Certainly, you know, Joe, who stretched
out the measuring line across it, what

00:16:24.385 --> 00:16:29.564
supports its foundation or who laid its
cornerstone while the morning star stars

00:16:29.574 --> 00:16:34.334
sing together and all the sons of God
shouted for joy, who enclosed the sea

00:16:34.334 --> 00:16:38.364
behind the doors and when it burst from
the womb and when I made the clouds, its

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:40.454
garment and total darkness in its blanket.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:45.510
When I determined its boundaries and
put its bars and doors in place, when

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:50.840
I declared you may come this far but
no further, you proud waves stop here.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:55.560
Have you ever in your life commanded the
morning or assigned the dawn its place

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.939
so that it may seize the edges of the
earth and shake the wicked out of it?

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.740
The earth is changed as clay is by a seal.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.200
Its heel stands out like
the folds of the garment.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.670
Light is withheld from the wicked and the
arm raised and the violence is broken.

00:17:09.105 --> 00:17:13.545
Have you traveled to the sources of the
sea or walked in the depths of the ocean?

00:17:13.905 --> 00:17:15.795
Have the gates of death
been revealed to you?

00:17:15.805 --> 00:17:17.614
Have you seen the gates of darkness?

00:17:17.645 --> 00:17:20.335
Have you comprehended
the extent of the earth?

00:17:20.694 --> 00:17:22.885
Tell me if you know all of this.

00:17:23.444 --> 00:17:27.185
And Job's response later on in
Job chapter 40 was basically this.

00:17:27.285 --> 00:17:28.574
I am insignificant.

00:17:28.885 --> 00:17:30.075
How can I answer you?

00:17:30.325 --> 00:17:32.245
I place my hand over my mouth.

00:17:32.675 --> 00:17:37.885
It's this idea of understanding that God
is our creator and in questioning that.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:43.980
We become like Job, where we really have
no authority or no place to question God.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.480
And that's really the starting point.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.910
God created, He says, the
heavens and the earth.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.720
And if we look at this a little
bit deeper, it's basically

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.650
the skies and the land.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:55.510
And if you really even take verse
1, in a way, this verse 1 summarizes

00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:57.360
everything He's getting ready to describe.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.700
He's getting ready to describe
everything after He says He

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.420
created the heavens and the earth.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.735
And really, when we look at verse
2, Verse 2 is kind of what we

00:18:05.735 --> 00:18:07.545
would call pre creation, right?

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:10.525
This is before everything was created.

00:18:10.525 --> 00:18:13.534
So it was formless, it was emptied,
it was covered in darkness.

00:18:13.915 --> 00:18:15.225
It was waste and void.

00:18:15.225 --> 00:18:19.155
And at this point, Earth
had no purpose and order.

00:18:19.885 --> 00:18:22.655
And when we think about darkness, and
most of the times throughout the Bible,

00:18:22.655 --> 00:18:24.735
darkness is attributed to evil, right?

00:18:25.135 --> 00:18:30.265
Um, and that is obviously what
God is changing in this void

00:18:30.265 --> 00:18:32.255
and wasteless land and place.

00:18:33.135 --> 00:18:36.475
And what I love about this, it says in
the back part of verse 2, it says that

00:18:36.475 --> 00:18:42.595
God was present over the waters of the
earth and over the surface of the waters.

00:18:43.125 --> 00:18:48.545
God was still present, ready to bring
order so that life could flourish.

00:18:49.224 --> 00:18:50.285
I want you to think
about this for a minute.

00:18:50.634 --> 00:18:53.375
And this is kind of just thinking
outside of the box here a little bit.

00:18:53.855 --> 00:18:56.135
Do you know that God is waiting?

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:00.400
He's waiting in your life, on
the surface of your life, waiting

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.900
to bring order to your life.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.510
He's hovering over your life, ready so
that you, you and your life can flourish.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.059
I think that picture is so beautiful that
God created and He started that way and

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.320
He still believes that same thing in us.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.950
And so we see that, right?

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.310
At the beginning, God transforms
chaos into creation, starting

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.600
with those first two verses.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.470
But then we're going to move on to
the next several verses, 3 through 13.

00:19:25.875 --> 00:19:28.535
And we're going to talk about
the first three days of creation.

00:19:28.555 --> 00:19:33.655
The first three days of creation, each
of them begins with the phrase God said.

00:19:34.005 --> 00:19:37.154
And one of the things that I
think is so beautiful is that

00:19:37.154 --> 00:19:40.944
God breathed and life came to be.

00:19:40.955 --> 00:19:43.445
The earth began to form because God spoke.

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:46.155
And that's how things came together.

00:19:46.155 --> 00:19:49.555
And I think when we begin to look at
that, that's way outside of our life.

00:19:49.565 --> 00:19:52.995
Because I'll just tell you this, I
wake up every morning and I speak, but

00:19:53.005 --> 00:19:54.775
things don't form other than words.

00:19:56.225 --> 00:19:57.105
Anybody else?

00:19:57.475 --> 00:20:00.915
I mean, because if things could work that
way, then I would work that way, and I

00:20:00.915 --> 00:20:02.595
would just begin to talk about things.

00:20:02.595 --> 00:20:06.995
And the first thing I would speak
is a Porsche into existence, and my

00:20:06.995 --> 00:20:10.894
lawn to be mowed, and a couple of
other issues in life to be fixed.

00:20:10.945 --> 00:20:12.685
I would speak all day if that would work.

00:20:13.185 --> 00:20:15.715
But one of the interesting things, when
we look at this word creation, I want

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:16.565
to kind of go back to this for a minute.

00:20:16.705 --> 00:20:20.690
When we look at this word creation,
in the Bible, that word creation, In

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:26.110
its true form was only attributed to
God, which means this, anything that we

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:30.150
quote unquote create, we really don't
create, we build from God's creation.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.220
So I want you to think
about that for a minute.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.320
God is the only one that can create.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.869
We're the only ones that can
build out of God's creation.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.920
And at times we don't understand
that idea of the difference

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.260
between creation and building.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.699
But we're going to look at
Day 1, right, verses 3 5.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.300
So 3 5 says this thing, God said, let
there be light, and there was light,

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.230
and God saw the light, and it was good.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:58.000
And God separated the light from
the darkness, called the light day,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.730
and the darkness he called night,
and there was evening, and there

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.350
was morning, and that was Day 1.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.450
So many believe this is when
God began to establish time, and

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.170
order time, so day and night.

00:21:10.125 --> 00:21:14.205
And so when we look at this, the
question is, how could there be light?

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.510
If there wasn't even lightbearers
until day four, anybody know how

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.400
there could be light if there wasn't
any lightbearers until day four?

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.270
Anybody?

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:25.870
He was the light.

00:21:25.989 --> 00:21:31.260
In the beginning, God was the light,
and still is the light in our lives.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.129
Most of us think of visual light, and
maybe that's what it was, maybe it

00:21:34.129 --> 00:21:37.079
was this light that we see today, but
I believe that when we're thinking

00:21:37.079 --> 00:21:40.049
about this, is God began to separate
that darkness, and he began to bring

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:42.480
his presence, his light, into it.

00:21:43.155 --> 00:21:44.865
And so it came from God Himself.

00:21:45.375 --> 00:21:48.985
And so without natural light, and you guys
probably know this if you study enough,

00:21:48.985 --> 00:21:51.525
without light, our lives cannot exist.

00:21:51.525 --> 00:21:54.215
At some point, we will physically die.

00:21:54.485 --> 00:21:58.864
And without God's light, we
will spiritually die as well.

00:21:58.925 --> 00:22:01.585
And so in the beginning,
light was so important.

00:22:01.585 --> 00:22:04.335
And it's really, God's
light was so important.

00:22:04.575 --> 00:22:07.655
And so that's why He
separated darkness from light.

00:22:07.665 --> 00:22:11.075
And He began to bring
good into this creation.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:11.640
Right?

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.670
And he says it was good.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.960
So then we have day two, right?

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.490
Verses six through eight.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.150
It says, Then God said, Let there
be an expanse between the water,

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.640
separating the water from water.

00:22:22.189 --> 00:22:25.929
So God made the expanse separated, and
the water under the expanse from the

00:22:25.929 --> 00:22:28.979
water above the expanse, and it was so.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.280
And God called the expanse
sky and evening came, and then

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.550
morning, and then the second day.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.879
And so when we look at this, He
began to now separate those waters.

00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:41.530
And if you looked at the video at all
and you saw this, this idea between

00:22:41.889 --> 00:22:45.490
the water above and the water below,
God began to separate those things.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.530
Most believe that sky would be probably
the rain that He's holding back.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.889
Um, and many even would say this is the
water He's holding back before Noah.

00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:57.080
And we'll learn about Noah later
on before those floods came.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.899
And so Moses would have been also
leading people, um, out of Egypt.

00:23:02.929 --> 00:23:04.779
Going back to kind of the reason
why Moses would write this.

00:23:05.699 --> 00:23:09.449
And they would be dealing with
this idea behind people who were

00:23:09.449 --> 00:23:12.850
influenced by the myths of the
heavens and the earth and the seas.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.860
Um, and Moses is trying to
remind the people that God is

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.990
the one that controls the seas.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.789
He controls the water above
and the water below, right?

00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:23.409
The sky.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.310
Um, and so he's trying to
help them avoid worshiping the

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.510
creation rather than the creator.

00:23:29.889 --> 00:23:33.530
And so, in this instance,
God is trying to do a lot.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.340
Um, So then we move on.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.200
I think there's still
more here as we go on.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:39.899
So then he goes on.

00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:42.220
Then God said, Let the
earth produce vegetation.

00:23:43.119 --> 00:23:45.099
And, uh, wait, I didn't,
I moved on way too far.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:45.399
Here we go.

00:23:45.399 --> 00:23:46.050
So that was the second day.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.230
So the third day, um, did I jump ahead?

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:49.719
I may have jumped.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:50.229
No, I didn't.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.169
So third day, here we go.

00:23:51.189 --> 00:23:54.710
Then God said, Let the water under
the sky be gathered into one place.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:55.620
This is the third day.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:58.110
And let the dry land appear.

00:23:58.935 --> 00:24:03.475
This is that moment where there was
only water on earth until God began

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:08.395
to move earth above and began to have
this place of solid ground, right?

00:24:08.835 --> 00:24:12.405
And he says he called this dry land
earth and he gathered the water and

00:24:12.405 --> 00:24:16.375
he called it seas and now God saw that
it was good and he said let the earth

00:24:16.395 --> 00:24:20.345
produce vegetation, seed bearing plants,
fruit trees, and earth bearing fruit.

00:24:20.985 --> 00:24:24.925
With its seed according to its own
kind, and it was so, and the earth

00:24:24.925 --> 00:24:28.295
produced vegetation, seed bearing plants
according to the kinds of the trees,

00:24:28.615 --> 00:24:32.064
bearing fruit with its seed according
to the kinds, and God saw that it

00:24:32.065 --> 00:24:36.665
was good, and the evening came, and
morning came, and the third day, right?

00:24:36.934 --> 00:24:43.425
And so he creates this habitation, this
vegetation to now bring about life, right?

00:24:43.435 --> 00:24:46.875
To bring about life, an ability to be
able to sustain, because life would

00:24:46.895 --> 00:24:53.520
not have been able to sustain just on
water, but it had to have So, when we

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:58.350
look at this summary of these first
three days, God created time, right, He

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:03.820
created evening and day, He created the
sky or the heavens, right, He separated

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:08.709
the waters, He created the seas, and
then He created land, and they all had

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.424
a form, right, they all had a form.

00:25:11.115 --> 00:25:13.455
Um, and I begin to think about this.

00:25:13.455 --> 00:25:15.975
This is really the beginning
of God's greatest creation.

00:25:15.975 --> 00:25:19.075
So he breaks it into three days and he
creates these form and then he begins to

00:25:19.075 --> 00:25:21.965
fill all of these things that he created.

00:25:22.564 --> 00:25:26.514
And I stopped in the midst of writing
this message to just begin to picture all

00:25:26.514 --> 00:25:31.565
that God created in three days and how
magnificent that is and how easy it is

00:25:31.575 --> 00:25:33.405
for us to forget that on a daily basis.

00:25:33.425 --> 00:25:35.004
Does anybody ever think about...

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.810
You know, God's separating the waters, and
He's told the waters to only come so far.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:40.760
Anybody ever think about that?

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.669
Like, the waters can't come any further.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.129
Have you ever thought about that,
the idea that we actually have land

00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:50.129
to live on, and that God is the one
that brought that up out of the water?

00:25:50.889 --> 00:25:55.289
Did we ever think about that everything
in creation was literally designed

00:25:55.289 --> 00:25:57.490
for us, and we're getting ready
to talk more and more about that.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:01.810
Like, I think at times we
miss the awe of even existing.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.120
On Earth.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:08.600
Like, it's just, I just expect to wake up
and have everything, the sun to come up,

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:13.330
and the, you know, day to happen, and life
to work, and to be able to breathe, but I

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.099
tend to miss the awe of what God has done.

00:26:16.099 --> 00:26:21.919
And so, now let's see how God begins
to fill these first three days, right?

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.310
So He fills the Earth, and
He begins to take all of the

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.960
creation, um, from that point.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.110
So let's look at day four.

00:26:28.139 --> 00:26:30.189
So, verses 14 through 19.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.730
It says, Then God said, Let there be
lights in the expanse of the sky to

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:38.460
separate the day from the night, and
they will serve as signs for the season

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.019
and for the days and for the years.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.400
And there will be lights in the expanse
of the sky to provide light on earth.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:44.720
And it was so.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.599
And God made two great lights, the
greater light to rule over the day

00:26:48.599 --> 00:26:52.190
and the lesser light to rule over
the night, as well as the stars.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:56.430
And God placed them in the expanse of
the sky to provide light on the earth.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:01.430
To rule the day and the night,
to separate light from darkness.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.330
And God saw that it was good, and
evening came and morning came.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.530
And then it was the fourth day.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.340
So now we begin to see
some really cool things.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.730
And why I say that they're cool
things, when we think about these

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.850
lights that God placed in the sky.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:17.910
The greater light, which is the sun, and
the lesser light, which would be the moon.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.560
And then he mentions the stars
kind of like as a side note.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.370
But has anybody ever studied
about stars and galaxies?

00:27:23.385 --> 00:27:25.425
Season blow your mind.

00:27:26.025 --> 00:27:31.065
They will blow your mind at how
magnificent they are and how

00:27:31.155 --> 00:27:35.895
many of 'em they are and how much
we don't know about them yet.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.195
God just kind of us as a little
side note, and the stars like, eh,

00:27:39.254 --> 00:27:40.455
I just kind of threw those up there.

00:27:40.695 --> 00:27:45.585
But they're such an amazing part of
our creation, and he says that they

00:27:45.585 --> 00:27:48.975
begin to have this light and I begin to
think, where did this light come from?

00:27:49.545 --> 00:27:51.345
God began to take the light that he had.

00:27:51.345 --> 00:27:52.605
He began to place it.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:57.840
In the sky, and they separated again
the day and the night, and we begin to

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.690
think about, he says he's separating
more and more darkness, he's bringing

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:03.380
more and more of his life into creation.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.380
And these lights, if you go back to
Moses, Moses is writing that these

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.610
lights were created by God for us.

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.610
That Moses would have been leading
people that had been around other

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:20.820
people who worshipped the sun and
the moon and the stars as God.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:25.670
And so Moses is reminding them that
they are created by God and for

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.550
a purpose, but they are not meant
to be worshipped, that God is the

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:29.890
only one that's to be worshipped.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:30.570
Right?

00:28:30.849 --> 00:28:34.080
And you see that now day one and four
are connected because of the light

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.980
in day one and the light in day four.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.789
And then we look at day five, and I know
I'm going through this pretty quickly.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:46.190
Um, so in day five, so we have verses
20 through 23, it says, Then God

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.290
said, Let the water swarm with living
creatures and let the birds fly above.

00:28:50.865 --> 00:28:53.255
The earth across the expanse of the sky.

00:28:53.295 --> 00:28:57.685
So God created the large sea creatures
and every living creature that moved and

00:28:57.685 --> 00:29:01.005
swarmed in the water according to their
kinds and he also created every winged

00:29:01.005 --> 00:29:05.648
creature according to its kind and God
saw that it was good and God blessed them.

00:29:05.648 --> 00:29:08.514
This is the first time you'll see
the word blessed in the Bible.

00:29:08.525 --> 00:29:10.805
God blessed them and what came after?

00:29:11.085 --> 00:29:14.305
Be fruitful and multiply and
fill these waters of the sea.

00:29:14.785 --> 00:29:16.385
And let the birds multiply on earth.

00:29:16.455 --> 00:29:19.565
Evening came, and then morning,
and then the fifth day.

00:29:19.605 --> 00:29:22.535
This is where we begin to
start seeing living creatures.

00:29:22.835 --> 00:29:24.925
He's working towards a greater plan.

00:29:24.925 --> 00:29:28.804
He's creating all these things not
to just exist in and of themselves,

00:29:28.874 --> 00:29:30.595
but to be there for a purpose.

00:29:30.905 --> 00:29:32.084
And the first purpose was...

00:29:32.475 --> 00:29:35.555
The, the ones that would
fill the air and the water.

00:29:35.555 --> 00:29:39.615
If you'll remember, day two was
the creation of the expanse, right?

00:29:39.615 --> 00:29:42.245
Dividing the expanse,
the sky and the waters.

00:29:42.245 --> 00:29:45.365
And now he filled it with these
different creatures, right?

00:29:45.635 --> 00:29:47.334
In the water and in the earth.

00:29:47.765 --> 00:29:52.225
And, uh, when we think about these
creatures, we think about them as

00:29:52.855 --> 00:29:54.665
obviously amazing that God created them.

00:29:54.665 --> 00:29:56.625
But they still, God wasn't done.

00:29:56.645 --> 00:29:57.685
It says he blessed them.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.360
Which, again, is the first time that
we see this, and He's blessed them

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.940
to reproduce and use the nourishment
of the earth to do that, and to

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.450
be able to live there and do that.

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:10.630
Um, but God's really leading up to this
last day, and this is really, I've been

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:14.769
trying to get us there, understanding
God's magnitude here, but really,

00:30:14.769 --> 00:30:19.039
God's creating every single one of
these things, ultimately, for day six.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.800
And it's not the first part of day six,
but we're going to still read this.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:27.160
So in verses 24 through 31, it says,
then God said, let the earth produce

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:31.520
living creatures according to their
kinds, live livestock and creatures

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.710
that crawl and the wildlife of the
earth according to their kinds.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:35.600
And it was so.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.560
And so God made the wildlife of
the earth according to their kind.

00:30:39.375 --> 00:30:42.465
The livestock according to their
kinds, and all the creatures that

00:30:42.465 --> 00:30:46.294
crawl on the ground according to their
kinds, and God saw that it was good.

00:30:46.294 --> 00:30:49.914
As you guys continue to see that theme,
that God saw that it was good, right?

00:30:49.915 --> 00:30:51.664
That he made things that were good.

00:30:51.705 --> 00:30:53.844
But we're getting ready to see
something that was not just

00:30:53.844 --> 00:30:55.524
good, but it was really good.

00:30:56.064 --> 00:30:59.804
And it says this, Then God
said, let us make man in our own

00:30:59.805 --> 00:31:01.585
image, according to our likeness.

00:31:02.295 --> 00:31:06.254
And they will rule the fish of the seas
and the birds of the sky and the livestock

00:31:06.254 --> 00:31:09.984
and the whole earth and the creatures
that saw, uh, that crawl on the earth.

00:31:10.444 --> 00:31:14.385
So God created man in his own image
and he created him in the image of God.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:18.480
And he created them male and female
and God blessed them and God said to

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.770
them, be fruitful and multiply, fill
the earth and subdue it, rule the fish

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:26.529
of the sea, the birds of the sky, and
every creature that crawls on the earth.

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.590
And God also said, look,
I have given you every...

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:33.030
seed bearing plant on the surface
of the entire earth and every

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:35.050
tree whose fruit contains seed.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.390
This will be food for you and for
all the wildlife of the earth, for

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:41.460
every bird of the sky and for every
creature that crawls in the earth and

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.250
everything having breath of life in it.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:48.990
And I have given every green plant for
food and it was so, and God saw all

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.954
that he had made and it was very good.

00:31:51.215 --> 00:31:56.095
Indeed, an evening came and then
morning and the sixth day we look

00:31:56.095 --> 00:32:00.034
at this last day as one of the most
critical sense a last days before

00:32:00.034 --> 00:32:04.034
rest right before God was done and he
rested and we see the creatures, right?

00:32:04.034 --> 00:32:07.414
The creatures that he created and
those things were good, but those

00:32:07.414 --> 00:32:09.695
were not God's greatest creation.

00:32:09.814 --> 00:32:13.975
It was part of the process, but
it was not his greatest creation.

00:32:14.155 --> 00:32:17.735
Creating mankind in his image was God's.

00:32:18.605 --> 00:32:23.295
His final goal, his goal was
to create people that would

00:32:23.315 --> 00:32:24.965
reflect the image of God.

00:32:25.805 --> 00:32:28.535
And that was at the beginning of creation.

00:32:28.805 --> 00:32:32.595
And that is still today that when
you were created, because here's

00:32:32.595 --> 00:32:34.075
the thing, everybody was born.

00:32:34.215 --> 00:32:37.884
I just, I just tell you, everybody
was born in this room and you were

00:32:37.884 --> 00:32:41.155
created in the image of God to reflect.

00:32:41.735 --> 00:32:46.325
God to the world and to
rule over creation, right?

00:32:46.375 --> 00:32:51.144
Unlike animals who were also formed
from the ground like the people

00:32:51.144 --> 00:32:54.065
were in this, they were given
provisions just like humans were.

00:32:54.094 --> 00:32:56.275
They were blessed to be
fruitful and multiply.

00:32:56.735 --> 00:33:01.225
But humans were different because they
had the likeness or the image of God.

00:33:01.815 --> 00:33:04.805
And so whenever we think about the
word image, what does that mean?

00:33:05.365 --> 00:33:07.995
So when we think about image, we
think about personality of God,

00:33:08.014 --> 00:33:12.594
the nature of God, the capacity
of moral decision like God.

00:33:12.594 --> 00:33:16.785
And many would even say this, the
reflection of God's spiritual nature.

00:33:17.415 --> 00:33:20.545
And some would say this question,
so do we look physically like God?

00:33:20.555 --> 00:33:23.155
Well, ultimately, God is a spirit.

00:33:23.814 --> 00:33:29.685
So I would say to look like a spirit, no
we don't, but we internally look like God.

00:33:29.695 --> 00:33:33.494
We have the capacities of
God's reflection, of His image.

00:33:33.935 --> 00:33:36.125
Um, and so we're image bearers of God.

00:33:36.804 --> 00:33:38.485
And, and I started thinking about this.

00:33:38.514 --> 00:33:41.014
If you go back to, because he makes
this statement, and again I don't have

00:33:41.014 --> 00:33:42.415
a ton of time to dive deep into it.

00:33:42.625 --> 00:33:46.465
But he says, let's make man in our image.

00:33:47.095 --> 00:33:48.595
And that always is the question.

00:33:48.645 --> 00:33:50.405
What does it mean by our image?

00:33:50.685 --> 00:33:55.395
Well, if you go to the second chapter, or
second verse, you'll see that the Spirit

00:33:55.415 --> 00:33:57.595
of God was hovering over the waters.

00:33:57.805 --> 00:33:58.464
We have the Spirit.

00:33:58.904 --> 00:34:01.784
Well, in verse one, we have God created...

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:03.470
The heavens and the earth.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.300
So we have God, but where
is maybe Jesus in this?

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.370
Because most people would say, hey,
Jesus was there in the beginning.

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.190
And as you get into the New
Testament, you'll hear this, that

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.480
Jesus was there in the beginning.

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:14.250
And the answer is, it's in this where.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:19.060
Let us, let us make man in
our image, in our likeness.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.330
And so Jesus was there in the beginning.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.995
This is where we begin to see the,
Trinity is what we talk about, or

00:34:23.254 --> 00:34:28.205
all aspects of who God is, they
are all God, um, and a different

00:34:28.214 --> 00:34:31.274
representative of God, and that's,
again, another story of another thing.

00:34:31.274 --> 00:34:35.644
But when I think about this idea
that God has given us the ability

00:34:35.794 --> 00:34:38.225
to reflect His image to the world.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:43.389
I think that is the key to this text,
that Moses, as he's writing this,

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:47.429
he's saying, Hey, I'm writing this
so that you know who created you.

00:34:47.439 --> 00:34:47.909
It was God.

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:53.310
It wasn't the moon god or the sun god or,
you know, it wasn't anybody in, you know,

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.059
when you think about the seas, a lot of
times they would even worship some crazy

00:34:56.059 --> 00:34:58.140
creatures from the sea that were massive.

00:34:58.544 --> 00:35:03.345
Um, He says don't worship them, worship
the one true God who created everything

00:35:03.564 --> 00:35:04.954
that you think about to worship.

00:35:05.174 --> 00:35:06.894
He created every one of those things.

00:35:07.464 --> 00:35:10.934
So He created you, and He created
me, He created everything that

00:35:10.944 --> 00:35:14.314
we see and we exist around, but
He created us for a purpose.

00:35:14.314 --> 00:35:18.674
And when we look at this text, we're
image bearers of God, and we have a

00:35:18.694 --> 00:35:20.285
responsibility based upon this text.

00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:23.475
Number one, this is gonna
be fun to you, to reproduce.

00:35:23.475 --> 00:35:25.814
And I think this church does
a great job of reproducing.

00:35:25.825 --> 00:35:26.794
Maybe you don't need to be...

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.530
Cheered on about that one.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:30.960
But he says to reproduce life.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.110
And I really want to challenge
you in this statement.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:34.600
Hear me out on this.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:40.990
I think many of us think of this idea,
he wants us to reproduce physically.

00:35:41.089 --> 00:35:44.670
I believe in this text he's
also talking about spiritually.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:50.240
That means this, that as we reproduce
spiritually, as we are image bearers of

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.650
Christ to the world, and other people come
to know Christ because of you actually

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:59.950
taking an image of God and sharing it
with the world, that you're reproducing.

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:01.730
Anybody ever see that point in this text?

00:36:02.279 --> 00:36:03.329
I never saw that point.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:09.250
Before studying this text, I believe he's
saying be reproducers of the image of God,

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.140
physically, yes, but more so spiritually.

00:36:12.679 --> 00:36:15.520
And I believe if you get into the
New Testament, that is the call on

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:20.450
our lives to be images of Christ
to the world so that other people

00:36:20.509 --> 00:36:21.699
can come to faith in Christ.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.049
Amen?

00:36:22.799 --> 00:36:26.310
I think that's so cool that
in creation it started there.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.460
And then we see this
thing called evangelism.

00:36:28.605 --> 00:36:31.525
Goin and tellin people, makin disciples,
and we think it's something new.

00:36:32.045 --> 00:36:33.785
It's actually an Old Testament thing.

00:36:33.785 --> 00:36:35.275
It's a creation thing.

00:36:35.675 --> 00:36:38.054
And, uh, I just, that's
just a challenge to you.

00:36:38.055 --> 00:36:40.715
The other thing he said, for image
bearers of Christ, is to have

00:36:40.715 --> 00:36:42.415
dominion over the world in creation.

00:36:42.415 --> 00:36:46.975
And this is something, again, he even said
that we can have dominion over darkness.

00:36:47.669 --> 00:36:50.049
And so we are facing an enemy daily.

00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:51.879
Every one of us is facing an enemy daily.

00:36:51.889 --> 00:36:56.309
And we can know from this text
that we are meant to have dominion.

00:36:56.569 --> 00:36:58.359
To be able to rule over.

00:36:58.669 --> 00:37:00.289
There's nothing that can rule over us.

00:37:00.289 --> 00:37:01.779
God has given us that.

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:02.179
Right?

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.079
And I think that's a beautiful
picture to understand.

00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:07.970
That we are meant to reproduce
physically and spiritually.

00:37:07.999 --> 00:37:10.269
But to also have dominion
over all of creation.

00:37:10.279 --> 00:37:11.609
Even darkness and evil.

00:37:12.139 --> 00:37:13.499
And he even gives us, this is what I love.

00:37:13.509 --> 00:37:14.669
He even gives us the food.

00:37:15.125 --> 00:37:18.575
To have strength, because I'm telling
you this, if I did not have food,

00:37:18.654 --> 00:37:21.725
I would not have the strength to
reproduce and to go out and be the

00:37:21.725 --> 00:37:25.194
image bearer of Christ, uh, and God to
the world, and so I'm thankful that he

00:37:25.194 --> 00:37:26.495
gave us food as he talks about here.

00:37:26.555 --> 00:37:29.705
But here's some thoughts to consider
as we kind of finish up on this.

00:37:29.705 --> 00:37:32.004
And so you want to know,
man, that was quick.

00:37:32.194 --> 00:37:34.984
Well, in chapter two, we're going to kind
of go back to a little bit of the image

00:37:35.004 --> 00:37:38.205
of God and creation of man, because he
kind of expands it a little bit more.

00:37:38.529 --> 00:37:40.730
We'll dive into that a little bit
deeper, but here's some thoughts

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:44.040
to consider today for you to take
home from this first chapter.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:50.019
Number one, when God formed us, He
formed us as like a potter with clay.

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:53.709
And I would think about this,
He created a work of art.

00:37:54.669 --> 00:37:56.939
And I'll just tell you
this, we weren't a mistake.

00:37:56.939 --> 00:38:00.879
If you're sitting in this room and
you're thinking, God made a mistake.

00:38:01.009 --> 00:38:02.430
He should have thrown me out.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:03.899
Um, He didn't.

00:38:04.039 --> 00:38:05.359
God doesn't make mistakes.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:08.180
God is perfect and God created you.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.989
And it says even in Jeremiah that He
knows us before we were even born.

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:14.509
He knew us when we were
knitted in our mother's womb.

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:20.719
And then also, because God made us, we
are wholly dependent upon Him as creator.

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:22.140
What do you mean by that?

00:38:22.539 --> 00:38:23.309
I'll just tell you this.

00:38:23.609 --> 00:38:26.039
If you've taken a breath at any
point during this message, and if you

00:38:26.039 --> 00:38:28.289
haven't, you're probably blue in the
face and you're about to pass out.

00:38:28.809 --> 00:38:32.519
But if you took a breath,
God provided that for you.

00:38:33.169 --> 00:38:39.369
If you have any sort of, like, house
or car, God provided the resources

00:38:39.369 --> 00:38:43.450
that came out of the earth to
build those things that you have.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:48.600
If you have strength in your body to
move and to function, it's because

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:53.350
of the food that is provided from the
ground of the earth that God created.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.470
So because God made us, and it
goes back to this, if you truly

00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:01.940
believe God made you, Then we are
dependent upon God to provide it.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:04.670
You may say, no, Walmart provides my food.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.190
Just wait, whenever the pandemic happened,
a lot of times Walmart was out of stuff.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:10.300
We begin to kind of freak out.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:12.990
We may have actually prayed to
God to provide some food, right?

00:39:13.289 --> 00:39:16.480
And so we don't really
understand our need for God.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.010
It's those moments where kids think
that food does just grow, like

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:22.560
bread just literally comes up out
of the ground, like literal bread.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.610
I mean, ask us.

00:39:23.955 --> 00:39:26.775
They probably think that,
uh, but it doesn't, right?

00:39:26.855 --> 00:39:28.645
God created all those resources there.

00:39:28.695 --> 00:39:30.134
The la a couple other things here.

00:39:30.565 --> 00:39:34.505
Because He created us, we have
full access, or we can have full

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:36.355
access to God through Jesus.

00:39:36.654 --> 00:39:40.725
And I love that, because God's original
design was to have a relationship with

00:39:40.725 --> 00:39:45.034
man, and His final design is for us to
have a relationship with man personally.

00:39:46.345 --> 00:39:50.924
And then also, God didn't just say
that He was creating us that was good.

00:39:50.935 --> 00:39:52.685
He said it was very good.

00:39:52.845 --> 00:39:57.055
And we need to remember that we are God's
greatest creation, and we are very good.

00:39:57.085 --> 00:40:00.525
I want to leave you with a verse here
before we kind of talk about what we

00:40:00.525 --> 00:40:04.764
can take home just as a, uh, hopefully
an application point to your life.

00:40:04.764 --> 00:40:10.319
But Revelation 4, 11 says this,
Our Lord and God You are worthy to

00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:15.910
receive glory and honor and power
because you have created all things.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.959
And by your will, they
exist and were created.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.419
I believe one of the last things
that we, we gain from understanding

00:40:23.419 --> 00:40:27.019
that God created us, is that
he is worthy of our worship.

00:40:28.289 --> 00:40:29.519
What does that mean to worship God?

00:40:29.519 --> 00:40:32.240
It is literally meaning to,
to lay out flat on our face.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:33.970
and be wholly dependent upon Him.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.500
And anything else is sub part.

00:40:37.009 --> 00:40:41.330
Anything else is sub part to what God
deserves for creating us and providing

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.680
every single thing that we have.

00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:48.520
So, although we covered a lot of text
in a short amount of time, and yes we

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.009
glazed over certain things, I think God
cares more about transformation than

00:40:53.009 --> 00:40:56.710
information, which means this, we could
have taken every verse and dove deeper.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.859
And asks a lot of different questions,
and here's my challenge to you.

00:40:59.859 --> 00:41:04.600
If you have them, ask them, but also if
you have them, seek them on your own.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.180
I can give you some resources and
some places to seek a little bit

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.639
deeper than what we went to today.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.549
But God cares more about
transformation than information.

00:41:11.879 --> 00:41:16.140
I've said this, wisdom is
actually application of knowledge,

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.879
of what we've gained today.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.009
And so what I will challenge
you with today is, number one,

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.200
do you know who created you?

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:24.029
Do you believe?

00:41:24.634 --> 00:41:26.415
In the Word of God and
that God created you.

00:41:26.415 --> 00:41:30.154
Number two, do you believe
what you were created for?

00:41:30.225 --> 00:41:32.734
To be image bearers to the world.

00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:37.495
To, to what I would say is to,
to share that image with others.

00:41:37.644 --> 00:41:37.944
Right?

00:41:37.964 --> 00:41:41.055
The spiritual nature of
God's character with others.

00:41:41.894 --> 00:41:42.214
Right?

00:41:42.834 --> 00:41:47.814
Is knowing God created you enough
for you to go out and act on it.

00:41:48.044 --> 00:41:48.325
Right?

00:41:48.415 --> 00:41:49.064
Action.

00:41:49.075 --> 00:41:51.375
Not just knowledge, but action.

00:41:51.919 --> 00:41:54.620
And, and, and I think that's a
great question for all of us.

00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:58.799
Because who's the last person
that said to you, Man, I really

00:41:58.799 --> 00:42:00.149
see something different in you.

00:42:00.399 --> 00:42:01.120
What is it?

00:42:02.169 --> 00:42:02.779
What is it?

00:42:03.129 --> 00:42:04.799
Has anybody had that happen recently?

00:42:04.799 --> 00:42:06.879
Is somebody saying, You handled
that situation differently.

00:42:06.879 --> 00:42:07.819
You acted differently.

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:09.390
You treated me differently.

00:42:09.819 --> 00:42:11.629
There's something
different about your life.

00:42:11.629 --> 00:42:14.899
And you can begin to say, It's probably
because I'm an image bearer just like you.

00:42:15.169 --> 00:42:19.290
And I chose to reflect God to the world.

00:42:20.315 --> 00:42:22.794
And then you want to be able
to share with them, how can you

00:42:22.794 --> 00:42:24.605
reflect God to the world, right?

00:42:24.694 --> 00:42:26.075
How can you reflect God to the world?

00:42:26.424 --> 00:42:28.134
And I think that's a
challenge for all of us.

00:42:28.475 --> 00:42:32.035
That we are God's greatest creation
to reflect Him to the world.

00:42:32.495 --> 00:42:34.605
So here's what I'm going to do,
this is what we do for invitation.

00:42:34.605 --> 00:42:38.245
We take some time to pray, and I'll
lead you through some thoughts.

00:42:38.734 --> 00:42:41.475
And it's just an opportunity for
each one of us to go, I didn't

00:42:41.475 --> 00:42:43.685
just hear a lot of verses today.

00:42:44.555 --> 00:42:49.595
And a lot of speaking, I actually get
the opportunity to put it into my heart

00:42:49.604 --> 00:42:55.224
to go from here to here and say, Hey,
how can I take something from today

00:42:55.764 --> 00:42:58.184
and begin to live it out in my life.

00:42:58.184 --> 00:43:00.284
So I'm going to pray for us and then
we're just going to continue praying.

00:43:00.304 --> 00:43:02.734
I'm just going to lead you to some
things that you could pray right where

00:43:02.744 --> 00:43:06.504
you're sitting and we'll take some time
to pray in each one of those moments.

00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:11.414
So Lord Jesus, we thank you so much Lord
for today, even though there's so much.

00:43:12.095 --> 00:43:17.555
In chapter one of Genesis, Lord, we
understand that everything that happened

00:43:17.555 --> 00:43:24.444
in the book of Genesis was pointing to
creating us, your greatest creation.

00:43:24.984 --> 00:43:29.504
And God, you created us because you
desired to have a personal relationship

00:43:29.504 --> 00:43:34.065
with us, for us to experience
more and more of you, and then to

00:43:34.075 --> 00:43:37.035
reflect that to everyone around us.

00:43:38.345 --> 00:43:42.445
God, you created us to have dominion
over the world, and to over all the

00:43:42.465 --> 00:43:47.085
enemies and the darkness that we face
in our lives, and Lord, you created

00:43:47.085 --> 00:43:50.185
us for those things, and I think one
of the coolest things, Lord, is that

00:43:50.185 --> 00:43:53.014
you created us because you loved us.

00:43:53.924 --> 00:43:57.415
You created us because you desire
to know us personally, and a God

00:43:57.415 --> 00:44:00.685
that creates someone like that is
a God worth serving, a God worth

00:44:00.685 --> 00:44:04.805
worshiping, one who created every
single thing that we have for our good.

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:07.700
For us to be able to experience.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:12.250
So Lord, I pray that as we take time
today to consider what we've learned, and

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:15.570
how this applies to our life, Lord, will
you speak to our hearts and our minds?

00:44:15.789 --> 00:44:18.950
Will you help us turn to you
if we haven't turned to you?

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:22.010
Will you help us repent of sins,
Lord, if that's what's hindering us?

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.700
Lord, will you help us leave here
changed because of what you'll

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:26.840
do in our hearts and lives?

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:29.290
And so Lord, we pray this
in your heavenly name.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:30.630
Amen.

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:33.389
So as you're sitting there,
this is really where...

00:44:33.865 --> 00:44:35.485
I want to just challenge
you to pray a few things.

00:44:35.485 --> 00:44:37.865
I'm going to lead you through one of
those things to pray about, and I'm going

00:44:37.865 --> 00:44:39.505
to lead you through one more after that.

00:44:39.875 --> 00:44:42.585
So the first thing, I just really want
you to sit there and ask the Lord.

00:44:42.585 --> 00:44:44.105
I want you to ask the Lord this question.

00:44:44.775 --> 00:44:48.315
To reveal whether you truly
believe that God created you.

00:44:49.555 --> 00:44:50.344
That's the first thing.

00:44:51.064 --> 00:44:54.445
Ask God, do I truly believe
that you created me?

00:44:54.855 --> 00:44:56.055
So I just want you to start right there.

00:44:56.065 --> 00:44:59.635
Just asking God to let him reveal
to you whether you have a lack

00:44:59.635 --> 00:45:02.154
of faith, or whether you truly
believe that God created you.

00:45:02.155 --> 00:45:03.304
So just take a minute there to pray.

00:45:20.325 --> 00:45:24.154
Alright, the next thing I want you
to ask God is, Lord, do I truly

00:45:24.154 --> 00:45:27.055
believe you created me for a purpose?

00:45:27.744 --> 00:45:29.065
I just ask that God that right now.

00:45:29.074 --> 00:45:34.504
Lord, do I truly believe that you created
me to do something specific in my life?

00:45:50.625 --> 00:45:55.415
Now, based upon asking the Lord this
question and what you sense the Lord

00:45:55.415 --> 00:45:58.645
responding to you, you may have a
couple of ways that you can respond.

00:45:58.645 --> 00:46:00.305
And this is the next thing
that I want you to lead.

00:46:00.745 --> 00:46:01.995
Lead you to just pray to God.

00:46:02.595 --> 00:46:06.545
The first is, is if you've struggled
to, to wonder if God truly created you,

00:46:06.545 --> 00:46:10.525
or if you've struggled to wonder if God
truly created you for a purpose, maybe

00:46:10.525 --> 00:46:13.254
your prayer is, God help my unbelief.

00:46:14.385 --> 00:46:15.464
Help my unbelief.

00:46:15.465 --> 00:46:18.695
And help me overcome that.

00:46:18.715 --> 00:46:21.405
To truly believe that you created me,
and that you created me for a purpose.

00:46:21.405 --> 00:46:22.675
Maybe that's what you need to pray.

00:46:23.095 --> 00:46:26.695
For others, maybe the response was, yes,
you truly believe that God created you,

00:46:27.115 --> 00:46:28.325
and that God created you for a purpose.

00:46:28.325 --> 00:46:30.115
And here is what I challenge you to pray.

00:46:30.375 --> 00:46:32.045
God help me fulfill that purpose.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:43.710
I

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:16.740
want to challenge you with just this
statement before we stand in worship.

00:47:18.379 --> 00:47:21.819
Ever since the fall of creation,
so we haven't gotten there yet, but

00:47:21.819 --> 00:47:25.299
ever since the fall of creation,
people all over the world.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:27.960
People have been waiting
for a touch of God.

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:31.400
All over the world, they've
been waiting on a touch of God.

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:36.320
Waiting on lightbearers to
help them see their purpose

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.440
and experience their creator.

00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:40.820
People are waiting.

00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:52.620
Your original creation
of why you were born.

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.339
Are you ready to be a
lightbearer to the world?

00:47:54.839 --> 00:47:59.040
Are you ready to be a lightbearer
to your employees, your friends,

00:47:59.529 --> 00:48:01.890
your family, your neighbors?

00:48:03.089 --> 00:48:06.960
You name it, your coworkers,
your kids' soccer coach.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.609
Are you ready to be a library?

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:09.960
'cause God has called you to that.

00:48:10.439 --> 00:48:13.379
And I would say this, if you have
given your life to Jesus, that is

00:48:13.379 --> 00:48:15.839
your responsibility and your calling.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.390
And it is fulfilling when
you fulfill, when you do it.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:23.430
But when you do not walk in that calling,
you'll always feel a disconnect from God's

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:25.589
original and true design of your life.

00:48:26.225 --> 00:48:30.745
So I challenge you, those who have given
your life to Jesus, to go, live, inspire.

00:48:30.745 --> 00:48:31.415
I say that every week.

00:48:31.424 --> 00:48:32.694
Go, live, inspire.

00:48:33.265 --> 00:48:37.024
Be the light to those around you of
who God is and why He created us.

00:48:37.935 --> 00:48:40.604
But I really want to challenge those who
have never given their lives to Jesus.

00:48:40.604 --> 00:48:43.074
If you're in this room, you've
never given your life to Jesus.

00:48:43.294 --> 00:48:46.464
You aren't a lightbearer because you
have not received Jesus into your

00:48:46.464 --> 00:48:50.374
life to transform your life and to
be able to be bold for who Jesus is.

00:48:50.665 --> 00:48:52.765
I challenge you now to
give your life to Jesus.

00:48:52.765 --> 00:48:53.884
How do we give our lives to Jesus?

00:48:53.884 --> 00:48:55.095
We have met our needs for Him.

00:48:55.654 --> 00:48:57.154
Our need for Jesus, we admit it.

00:48:57.674 --> 00:49:00.714
We repent of our sins and we
turn away from things that are

00:49:00.714 --> 00:49:02.255
distracting us from our calling.

00:49:02.515 --> 00:49:04.055
And we say yes to Jesus.

00:49:04.984 --> 00:49:07.194
And we ask God to come into
our lives and transform us.

00:49:07.205 --> 00:49:09.605
So if that is you today, you
can pray that in your seat.

00:49:09.605 --> 00:49:10.764
You can say, God, I need you.

00:49:11.464 --> 00:49:12.774
God, I turn from my sins.

00:49:12.984 --> 00:49:14.525
And God, I invite you into my life.

00:49:14.745 --> 00:49:17.295
And if you've done that
today, we celebrate with you.

00:49:17.755 --> 00:49:20.065
We celebrate with you and we want
to continue to celebrate with you.

00:49:20.234 --> 00:49:21.855
And help you know how to follow Jesus.

00:49:22.185 --> 00:49:25.545
So during this time that we worship,
we're going to stand and worship Him.

00:49:25.755 --> 00:49:27.815
I'm going to stand in the back, and
I stand in the back to do two things.

00:49:27.815 --> 00:49:29.535
Number one, pray with you if you have any.

00:49:29.555 --> 00:49:33.015
Number two, to be able to talk to
you about how to come to know Jesus.

00:49:33.245 --> 00:49:35.914
To celebrate with those who have
given their lives to Jesus, or made

00:49:35.915 --> 00:49:37.355
a new commitment today in Jesus.

00:49:38.245 --> 00:49:41.085
So Lord Jesus, we pray
that God we continue.

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:45.965
To do exactly what we were created for,
and Lord, while we were placed on this

00:49:46.035 --> 00:49:49.825
earth with such amazing creations, to
be lightbearers to the world, Lord,

00:49:50.125 --> 00:49:55.185
lead us and guide us to follow you all
the days of our lives, and help others

00:49:55.185 --> 00:49:57.104
come to know you because of how we live.

00:49:57.745 --> 00:49:59.165
We pray this in your heavenly name.

00:49:59.655 --> 00:49:59.855
Amen.

00:50:00.274 --> 00:50:01.865
Let's stand and let's, let's worship.
