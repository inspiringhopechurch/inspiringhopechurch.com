00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:21.840
music

00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:03.840
that's right i recovered

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.840
over hello

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.840
together

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:59.840
hey

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.840
is

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.840
yes

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:01.760
uh you work your way back to the scene slowly one 
of the things you'll find uh as you continue to  

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.320
get to know inspiring hope is uh we really love 
relationships so um we struggle to get back to

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.640
i enjoy that and the more that we get to build 
relationships we believe we're stronger as people  

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.040
right i think god has designed right relationships 
together to encourage one another right and then  

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:32.560
relationship with him and so uh again we love 
that with our church to do that but um today we're  

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.440
gonna be in ephesians chapter five um and we're 
gonna be starting in verse 15 today if you don't  

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.360
have a bible with you i encourage you there's 
one back here on the main steps table grab it  

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.320
you can get up and grab that now or if you're like 
most people i would lose my bible if i brought to  

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.200
church every week sorry guys so i bring it on my 
phone so download a bible live it's a great way to  

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.520
be able to bring the word with you um each sunday 
and or even during the day of whatever you're  

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.080
going about your day so ephesians chapter five 
and one of the things i wanted to talk about is

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.200
as we move forward we've been actually walking 
through the book of ephesians as we move forward  

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.040
a lot of times we forget to look back right where 
have we been um and so it's it's just it could be  

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.280
a good time for us to just take a step back and 
say what have we what have we been reading what  

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.320
have we been studying over the last several 
several months i think since the beginning of  

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.560
this year we've been walking through the book of 
ephesians so the book of ephesians is wrote by the  

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:34.640
apostle paul um see paul was not an apostle at 
one point in his life where god transformed his  

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.360
life god radically changed his life because what 
god did for him he lived his life out for god um  

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.080
and we are really seeing that in this book to 
the ephesians these are writing a letter again  

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.720
to other believers and he wants to know the 
same thing that he knows right all the things  

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.120
that god has done for him all the things that 
god has done for him and so we spent the first  

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.120
three chapters and that's all that paul did in the 
first three chapters is really just talked about  

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.680
all that god has done for us all that god's 
divorce and there's two ways to look at this so  

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.080
as a believer it's all that god has done for us 
as somebody who doesn't know christ it's all that  

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.040
god can do for you so i'll say that again it's 
really writing in this this book the first three  

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.320
chapters is all that god's done for you if you are 
a follower of jesus or all that god can do for you  

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.640
if you follow jesus so there's two ways to look 
at that so i wanted to be able to highlight some  

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:29.280
of the things that paul mentioned god has done 
for us so he has chosen us again he's chosen us  

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.840
meaning that he he had the opportunity to leave 
us in our condition lost not a relationship  

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.840
with god speaking eternity separated from him 
but he chose us he adopted us he redeemed us  

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.120
and he's forgiven us and that's what you'll see 
if you're wondering where i'm getting all this is  

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.800
really the first three chapters of ephesians so 
i encourage you if you haven't read it lately  

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.320
after today's message go back and read 
the first three chapters of ephesians  

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.200
you'll get to see a lot of these things one 
he he's also given us an inheritance in heaven  

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.880
and this is a guarantee right i don't know 
about you guys but if somebody was to come  

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.920
to me today and say hey so-and-so left you 
inheritance i would be thrilled well guess what  

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.560
through god's word we learned that god has 
listened to this inheritance that will never  

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.680
never go away though it's guaranteed for 
us in heaven as we give in our lives to him  

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.200
he says that he has filled us with a promise again 
to keep us for eternity he's given us power and  

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:25.040
unity and grace and mercy he's created us for a 
purpose and this is really where we landed from  

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.640
last week so the first three chapters talked about 
all that god's done for us and as a result of  

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:34.480
what god has done for us we go live as children 
of life that's what we talked about last week  

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.600
in ephesians chapter five we go live as children 
of light and one of the ways that we describe that  

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.880
if you see some of these shirts around here 
is go live inspire that's exactly what that  

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.040
means go live for jesus go live in a way that 
shows other people jesus um and so the the the  

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.760
question here then is all that god's done for us 
we're supposed to do one imitate jesus how do we  

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.160
do that and that's exactly what paul did he didn't 
just say okay god's almost where you go walk his  

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.800
children's life he's actually practically talking 
about how we go live inspired how we walk his  

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.600
children's life how we walk and entertain jesus 
and so there's two ways he can kind of describe  

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.160
this in chapter five of things that we should put 
off or take off and things that we should put on  

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.120
as children of life as somebody who would follow 
jesus and so the couple of things that he talked  

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.160
about in chapter five was this we should put these 
things off sexual immorality and purity and greed  

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.120
obscene and foolish talking and cruel joking 
and then he says words of darkness and so  

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.200
all these things we were to put off and here was 
the big thing that we talked about as we were  

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.440
talking about the things we should put off why why 
should we put those things off because sometimes  

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.600
those things are fun or sometimes those things are 
funny but you know why can't we do that it's not  

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.560
valuable for you so he talks about this in verse 
11 where he says these things are not beneficial  

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.960
they're not fruitful they're not valuable for 
you so then he says okay here's some things we  

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.160
should put on those things we should put off as 
followers of jesus these things we should put on  

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.320
as followers of jesus and so he says we should 
put on purity we should put on thanksgiving  

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.400
and he says the fruit of children of life fruit 
of someone walking and following god is goodness  

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:12.080
righteousness and truth and so all the ways that 
god wants us to walk and that's guided for us is  

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.840
in these three words goodness righteousness and 
truth and again we walked through that last week  

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.000
and so all the things that we are really 
going to be talking about today rely on  

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.920
those things and so that's what i don't want us 
to miss is we're looking at these three verses  

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:31.120
15 16 and 17 i was planning to cover more verses 
but i literally got through these three verses and  

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.320
said gotta cut it up there's just so much here 
i think that paul's trying to speak to the the  

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.840
people he was writing to with this book but 
he's also speaking to us that's what i love  

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:45.440
about god's word it's timeless which means it 
applies to us today and maybe you've read this  

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.560
text in the past you're like i've already got 
it i don't need to hear another message on it  

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.840
that's not true because god's word is new every 
day which means there's different seasons of your  

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.720
life you read a word the word from god word of 
god and it really speaks to you differently i'm  

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:05.200
hoping and praying as you read today he'll speak 
to you a little bit different um with this text  

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.720
and so let's look at the verses here and i'll 
read those and then we'll jump in and so it says  

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:17.520
here in verse 15 it says pay careful attention 
then how you live not as unwise people but as  

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:25.600
wise making the most of the time because the days 
are evil don't be foolish but understand what the  

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.400
and so we're lord's will stop right there so let's 
pray and uh just ask god to joke in our hearts to  

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:38.880
hear what he has to say for us lord jesus we just 
pray lord not for you um to just lord work today  

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.880
i know that apart from you we can do nothing 
and lord i was just reminded as we opened up  

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.920
this this service and prayer that i felt like 
through the whole worship service we were really  

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.720
just praying we were giving our offering back 
to you and so lord i pray that this is another  

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.680
time that we do that we're listening intently 
lord we're listening in order to to know you  

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:06.400
and to know how to live in a way that others come 
to know and so we pray this in your heart amen  

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.320
so the first thing that we see here and i'm 
going to be very practical with you so if you're  

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.400
like hey the text you're just really telling me 
what the text says that that's good that's good  

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.360
i don't know you guys it's some of the things 
in the bible like we try to overcomplicate but  

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.440
it really speaks to just practical understanding 
i think we're going to learn that a little bit  

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:31.360
today so he says this pay careful attention 
to how you live pay careful attention how  

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.840
you live see i think about this um anybody 
had an overbearing parent growing up anybody  

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.800
i did here's what my mom would say every 
day before i got in the car watch out for  

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.760
the other driver watch out for the other journal 
like basically hey watch out who's on the road  

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:56.160
be very attentive right be very intense be careful 
how you drive what did i say to her i know i know  

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.840
but there were some days it really became numb 
right she would say that i was i really attended  

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.720
because i was probably blaring the music those 
were the days that texting just started and so  

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.640
that may date me but i started making texting 
while i was driving so was i really paying careful  

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.480
attention so these are those moments like you hear 
this you know okay great pay careful attention  

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.640
but let's really see why paul is saying pay 
careful attention and so when we look at this  

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:28.000
uh paul is saying again since we're looking at 
this in light of what we've studied is um he's  

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.680
saying that since darkness and brokenness is 
all around us right all these things we need  

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:37.440
to put off as followers of crisis all around us 
the way that we combat falling into these things  

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.600
is to be careful another word is diligent that 
maybe what's in your word is this word diligence  

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.880
showing constant effort to pursue life goodness 
righteousness righteousness and truth so what's  

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.240
the opposite right it's walking careless 
without proper guidance and forethought and  

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:02.080
whatever i think about these things i was actually 
driving on friday to sands with my wife and uh we  

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.400
were driving all of a sudden she said where are 
you going i said i don't know and she said well  

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.160
i thought you knew where you're going with her i 
don't have any clue right so i was driving in such  

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.600
a way that i was careless i had no clue we had 15 
minutes down the road away from where sam's was  

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.840
and so i just thought about this i wasn't i was 
just careless in my drive i wasn't even paying  

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.360
attention i didn't know where i was going i'm 
just driving of course we were very quiet for  

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.080
the next five or 10 minutes and she was angry that 
we were a little bit late but it's okay because  

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:34.000
it actually taught me a lesson right i wasn't 
careful at how we were going about life i wasn't  

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.640
really thinking through to pay careful attention 
and so i also think about this those of you who  

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.760
love sports i'm a sports guy i'm actually going 
to leave out of here today uh actually go to a  

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.000
dance recital across the road and then we're going 
to go to flight football and help coach that but  

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.600
let me tell you this is the way i think of things 
is my son when he first started playing black  

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.200
football this season they would play on defense 
everybody wants to play on offense everybody  

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.480
wants to be the quarterback of the running back i 
don't know about you guys but that's typically the  

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:05.520
two positions everybody wants to lead but when 
it comes on defense it's kind of like um right  

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.960
so here's what would happen we would we would 
line up for defense and they would stand like this  

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.160
they weren't like okay great and they would go and 
spit and run past them and then they'd get beat  

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.640
we said no you need to be careful gonna be ready 
right you'll be on your toes so that whenever  

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.040
the defense or one of the offense comes at you 
whenever the enemy comes at you you're ready  

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.320
you're paying careful attention to what 
they're doing right you're following the  

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.840
law you're listening you're a tenant that's 
exactly what paul said be ready be careful  

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:40.560
pay careful attention to how you live it's very 
very important that we do that so when we think  

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.920
about the christian life right we can't take the 
christian life for granted we can't take this  

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.640
life that god has called us to live for granted 
and i i make this statement and hopefully the  

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.400
same thing if you've heard it enough times 
at the moment of salvation you've given your  

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.640
life to christ if god was done with you he would 
have taken you to heaven but you're still here  

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:06.160
the question is why why why are you still here 
well because god has a design purpose for you  

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:13.360
for you yeah you and maybe you're wondering can 
god use you absolutely i would just dare you to  

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.560
go study a little bit of the bible and you'll 
see a lot of the broken people and struggling  

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:22.080
people who didn't have all the greatest gifts who 
were just willing to follow god and god houston  

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.360
so what i would say is we can't go through 
life by chance we have to pay careful attention  

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.840
the decisions that we're making need to be wise 
and that's that second part of this verse we're  

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.080
going to jump into but i want us to jump back 
and look at verse 14 for just a second because it  

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:42.960
really speaks to this so paul says this coming out 
of last week's test he says get up sleeper rise up  

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.240
from the dead and christ will shine on you so when 
we think about paying careful attention someone  

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.800
who is asleep or half a sleep is not really paying 
careful attention and this is what i thought  

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.720
anybody ever got up in the middle of the knife 
especially when you're sitting in a new place  

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.760
and you have your eyes closed you've got to go 
your eyes are closed and you run into the wall  

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.960
right we're asleep we're half asleep we're 
just kind of fumbling through life that's what  

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.800
paul's saying here pay careful attention 
open your eyes wake up sleeper god's got  

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:21.200
a purpose for you don't miss it don't 
miss it so i i want to ask this question  

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.120
you can answer it to yourself we'll ask this 
question do you want to make your life count

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:34.880
do you really want your life to matter and in 
the span of eternity that you did something worth  

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:43.760
value anybody i know i do and that's exactly why 
i'm here and i believe why many of you are here  

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:49.680
because you want to make your life count see paul 
is writing to other believers who are dealing  

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.880
with some persecution dealing with some struggles 
knowing these things are coming battling darkness  

00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:00.320
and worldly things that are drawing away and 
he's saying i want your life to matter pay  

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:06.400
careful attention to how you live so then paul 
begins to walk through this he lists several  

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.200
reasons why we should pay careful attention to 
our lives and how we walk and he starts with the  

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:17.840
second part of 15 so he says pay careful attention 
then to how you live not as unwise people but as  

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:23.200
wives so the first thing that paul's saying is 
we should pay careful attention to how we live is  

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.720
because it's a mark of wisdom i'll tell you this i 
like being around wise people they make me smarter  

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.760
i'm drawn to them right when they do things that 
are really good or valuable and like i want to  

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:39.600
know how they did and so what paul's saying is 
live as wise as unwise people right it's a mark of  

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.800
wisdom um and so people who are paying careful 
attention to their lives that are intentionally  

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.920
living their lifestyle are wise they're 
not unwise um and so we should be known as  

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:57.840
wise people because it points other people 
to jesus and uh i think about this when it  

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:04.320
comes to building a house a wise builder first 
puts the plans together right he sets up plans  

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.400
together so he knows how he's going to build the 
house what it looks like what he has to measure  

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.320
out for he doesn't just randomly go and say i'm 
gonna grab some pieces of wood and go out this  

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:19.520
he's intentional about how he does he's wise about 
how he does it yet how many of us plan our days  

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.960
and use them in such a way that is wise that 
will make the greatest difference i mean i i  

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.400
just want to know how many of you wake up and 
say today i'm going to wisely invest my time if  

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.320
this is the last day i lived and this is how i'm 
planning it out so i can make the greatest impact  

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:44.480
i don't think i can raise my hand and here's 
the reason why most of the time i don't i  

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.240
just jump into things and i start going and 
then at the end of the day i wonder if i even  

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.640
accomplished anything that was beneficial 
for me or even for for the kingdom of god  

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.920
and so paul's saying wise people pay attention why 
is people pay careful attention to how they live  

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:08.560
because they know their life matters their life 
has a purpose so i think about this when it comes  

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.600
to gun should anybody shoot at a target that he's 
targeting shooting either with an arrow or a gun  

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:19.920
you ever done it before any of you ever shot just 
to shoot not true to targets like just randomly  

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:25.040
like you're just like that would be careless right 
no we have a target in life to shoot out god has  

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:31.760
a target in life for us to follow him and aim 
and and purposely carefully aim at and shoot at  

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:38.080
yet i think about this many of us carry a title 
of being a christian but our lives don't match  

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.400
that time our lives are aiming at the wrong heart 
is we're not even in that target at all and i've  

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.760
read this and i'm going to move on to the next one 
but matthew 7 24-27 really speaks directly to this  

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.040
he says therefore everyone who hears these words 
of mine this is jesus speaking everyone who hears  

00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:00.640
these words of mine so he hears me and acts on 
him so follows through with him is a wise man  

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:06.160
who built his house on a rock the rain fell and 
the rivers rose and the winds blew and pounded  

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:12.800
on the house yet it didn't collapse because its 
foundation was on the rock but everyone who hears  

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:20.160
these words and doesn't act on it is a foolish man 
unwise basically who has built his house on sand  

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.640
the rain fell the rivers rose so the winds 
blew and pounded on the house and it collapsed  

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:32.480
and there was a great crash so we see here that 
for us again looking in light of of the life that  

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:39.440
we are living that we know god has given you today 
to live and nothing more guaranteed we should live  

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.800
and pay careful attention to how we live

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.000
talking through this he says that we 
should pay careful attention to how we live  

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.640
because it's a mark of wisdom but then he goes 
on and he says this is also because life is short  

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.800
verse 16 let's just look at verse 16 the first 
part of it he says making the most of your time  

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.800
making the most of your time so something 
you have in your in the bible where it  

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.960
says redeeming the time psalm 90 12 says 
this teach us to number our days carefully  

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:20.240
so that we may develop wisdom in our hearts see i 
i would say that that's exactly the psalmist there  

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:27.920
is exactly affirming what paul is saying make sure 
you're careful of how you live your life because  

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.080
we need to make the most of our time we 
don't know how many more days we have

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.880
but we look at this and we think through 
this and i started thinking through this like  

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:49.280
do you realize that seriously tomorrow you don't 
wake up like i mean i know i don't like being  

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.040
morbid like i don't want to be that guy i don't 
work with that guy's life every day i'm going  

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.000
to die tomorrow so better live it up today but 
really what we're seeing here is when you live  

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.240
what i would call it in short segments which says 
every day you live is every day is your last day  

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.960
how would you live so i want to ask that question 
seriously and so this is the part where you're  

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.920
gonna learn more about us i like asking questions 
i'm gonna stop and listen to y'all answer this  

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:21.840
so if you have one day to live this is your 
last day tell me what you do what would you do

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:55.680
hearts anybody else here's your last day 
to live how would you love this thing

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:07.280
do you remember last week we were studying uh 
matthew 28 and we said this is one of the last  

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:13.360
conversations jesus had with his followers and 
some of the times people's last words are some  

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:19.120
of the most important words to listen to this is 
the great commission that came out of that right  

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.160
a lot of people that they're on their 
deathbed as they wish they would have  

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.000
cherished moments with their family they wish 
they would have had more conversations or they  

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.440
would have done this or they would have done that 
right and so when we're thinking about if this was  

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.280
the last day to live the questions i started 
asking myself is how would we treat our family  

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.480
and spend time with him who would you go visit 
who would you tell here's important who would  

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.560
you know about jesus knowing that you may be the 
only person to get the opportunity to tell them  

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.280
would you get into petty arguments like 
me and my wife seems to get over like  

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.200
it could be some during the floor the next thing 
you know what's this big argument would you get  

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:03.200
in those anymore or would you say it's not 
worth it it's my last day um what about this  

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:10.160
would you put off giving your life to jesus 
because i'm i'm telling you there's times that  

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.400
we disable tomorrow next week would you put off 
giving your life to jesus if you knew tomorrow  

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.200
you weren't guaranteed to turn me in heaven with 
him let me share this story with you so my grandpa  

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.560
um about two years ago passed away and uh me 
and my family were actually getting ready to  

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:32.480
go on vacation doing the hospital at that point 
everything was fine um so we start traveling to  

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.480
florida and uh he's getting a little bit worse 
we get a chance to talk to them on the phone on  

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:43.120
our way to florida but while we're in florida they 
actually end up having to come in he's not doing  

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.440
well so we decided to end our vacation early 
we'll travel back we travel overnight we leave  

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.200
about seven pm we're going to travel all the way 
back to oklahoma that's when we lived in oklahoma  

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.000
so you're talking 17 18 hours but we're going to 
do a straight shot we did a short shot with all of  

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.440
our kids um we get back um 80 a.m in that morning 
my sister's going to come over we're going to go  

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.760
up to see my grandpa i jump in the shower and come 
out and my sister's been and my grandfather passed  

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:14.640
away see i realized i missed the moment right 
i missed the moment to go see it one more time  

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:22.080
and i think about this how many people come to the 
end of their lives not knowing that tomorrow's the  

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.800
last day they're gonna live and they missed the 
moment they missed the moment to live as though  

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.920
today is the last day that they would ever live 
and they would say these things they wouldn't  

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.880
want to say and they would accept the things 
they know they need to accept like jesus they  

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:40.640
would tell others about the things that mean the 
most of them right how many times there's people  

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:45.120
all over the world that don't know tomorrow's 
the last day and today they live is that they're  

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:51.600
guaranteed one see i just think about those 
moments like that i don't want you i don't want  

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.480
this city that we're trying to reach to live one 
more day apart from the relationship with jesus  

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.760
where they truly understand that you are designed 
every one of you are designed for a purpose  

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:08.240
to love god a relationship with him but to help 
others experience that love and hope in the midst  

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:15.120
of trials in the midst of struggling that's 
exactly where paul's getting made the most of  

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:20.960
your time make the most of your time and here's 
why he says this because the days are people  

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.800
see this is where we realize is that in that day 
of paul there's lots of persecution for christians  

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.560
for for other people he understood how important 
it was not to take for granted what opportunities  

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.240
he would have see he's writing from prison just 
so you know paul's writing this letter from prison  

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.160
and paul had no clue if he was going to get 
executed the next day or not he kept pinning the  

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.000
letter because he wanted to make his life count 
he wanted to make sure he got as much truth out  

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.760
there for others to be changed and so he says you 
know these days are evil and so i think about this  

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:57.120
when we know that the days are people i mean i 
don't i most people i talk to know this i mean  

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.600
the world's not in a great situation we'd love 
to think maybe it is but it's really not and i'm  

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:06.080
not turning again debbie down on this it's not 
and it's not getting any better right now and  

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.960
it's just a sense of what's going to go on and 
here's what paul's saying i've been there before  

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.520
the days are evil so this is the question when 
as a follower of jesus most of times we're like  

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.160
we're good man if persecution comes and i die 
and going to heaven but what about the person  

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:27.760
that's waiting on you the days are evil so it's 
not about us being concerned about ourselves but  

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.640
it's this point where it's about being concerned 
about others paul's saying the days are evil  

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.160
pay careful attention to how you 
live make the most of your time  

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.560
because someone is waiting for 
you on the other side of obedience  

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:47.840
somebody's waiting on you to live today as though 
it's your blessing i mean how impactful is it  

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.160
i'm gonna step out here with you because i i 
understand the thoughts that go through your  

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.200
head well isn't god sovereign enough that he's 
already got somebody in place to lead everybody  

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.200
to faith in him at one point so i don't have 
to do anything i mean he's got other people  

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.400
and you know what i'm talking about my 
wife reading about this two days ago  

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:12.160
i said you know god is soft but every day he's 
inviting you to be a part of that sovereignty  

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:17.440
and if you don't we'll have an esther story right 
what did mordecai tell esther and i know if you  

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.960
don't know this context i'll tell you where 
it is after service this is what more guys  

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:26.400
said because esther had the ability to save her 
people if you don't do it esther god will raise  

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.560
up somebody that does and you know what as you 
chose to be she chose to be part of god's story  

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:39.040
days are you paul's saying make the most 
of your time he's giving you the gift if  

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.480
you give your life to jesus he's giving you the 
gift of salvation what are you gonna do with it  

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.600
what are you gonna do with it how do you live 
today as though it's your last day who are you  

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.000
gonna go talk to who you're gonna love are you 
gonna forgive oh man who you're gonna forgive  

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.560
make your life count this is 
exactly where paul is getting  

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.400
and i just think about this there's someone 
waiting for me on the other side of obedience  

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:08.320
don't leave them away don't leave me i just i 
want to challenge you this why are we why are  

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.680
we here today because of one separate weekends 
after another there's many people in this room  

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.960
who have done things in order to have said yes to 
things in order to see god's glory god's ability  

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.840
of his relationship to be shared with everybody 
around this city and in our spiritual fields  

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.880
and and what i would say is this you're 
part of that story and today god's asking  

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:34.000
you to take another step and be a part of 
that story we have a city waiting on us  

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.720
there's someone waiting on me and we have a city 
waiting on us to live today so it's our last  

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.080
so paul lists these reasons again why we 
should pay careful attention to how we live  

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.400
right it's a mark of wisdom because 
life is short because the days are evil  

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.440
and here's one that you're gonna go what let's 
look at it he says because god has given us a mind  

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:59.840
to do what with let's look at verse 17 he says so 
don't be foolish and again i think if he's saying  

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.680
don't be foolish don't be unwise he's being very 
particular here right he wants us to make sure we  

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:08.800
get this he says don't be foolish but understand 
what the lord's will is this word understand  

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:17.040
is more than just no right to understand the 
lord's will is to discover again god's purpose for  

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:23.680
you to follow in obedience to actually act on what 
god has told you so you may have heard god's heart  

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.560
you may have heard that god has saved you but are 
you walking in them have you heard that god has  

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:34.240
sent you to go tell other people about jesus but 
are you acting on that so he's given us this mind  

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:41.200
and then he says to search out basically what 
the lord's will is anybody in here ever asked  

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.720
and i just wish i knew what the lord's will 
for i've asked my life lot of times even as  

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:50.800
a pastor passed out a lot of times and 
you know what god reminds me every time  

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:57.840
that it's not a mystical experience or 
something that he's hiding from us god  

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:04.640
has clearly saved his will for your life if 
you want to find it if you want to discover it  

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.480
and so he he does that through a couple of 
different things he does that through his word  

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.880
through a prayer but also i would say 
this overarching school it's relationship

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.800
again either hopefully this makes sense 
to you there was this girl when i was  

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.760
in high school that used to come get 
breakfast every morning and i worked  

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.120
this girl so you know it's my future wife but

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.480
um i wanted to know like i knew of her

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:38.720
so i got to know her because i really 
wanted to know her so that took time  

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.680
i had asked a lot of questions i took her on 
dates we had conversations and i got to know  

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:49.280
her i watched the activities she did and i just 
i desired to know more and today there's probably  

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:54.320
not anything i can't tell you about her because 
she's an amazing woman who has amazing gifts  

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:59.920
and i'm thankful it happened so because i 
really cared i had a relationship with my wife  

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.560
so do you want to know jesus do you really 
want to know god's purpose for your life  

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:10.400
do you really want to fully understand god's 
will have a relationship him through what his  

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:17.120
word through and just been there you ever 
get this word like i don't know what that  

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.640
this is saying i've been there it takes time 
i mean we're sitting here worshiping today  

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.080
and i think back to the days when i first 
started worship worshiping as a believer  

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.200
i didn't have any clue what those words 
meant i still shared this story i was at  

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.920
a meeting and there was this promotion that 
came up the lord suffered and i turned to  

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.000
my wife and said what what mill do we need to 
bring i didn't understand the word sufferings  

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.120
that's okay right we're learning this is the 
part of our relationship early on with my life  

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.200
whenever i started today here i didn't know much 
about her but now her favorite color is blue  

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.320
i know she loves kids i know that she is a 
committed follower of jesus there's so much  

00:33:54.320 --> 00:34:00.400
more that i knew as i spent time with her so it 
does take time but let me share this romans 12 1-2  

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:07.520
says therefore brothers and sisters in view of the 
mercies of god i urge you to present your body as  

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:12.800
a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to god this 
is your true worship and so he says this and this  

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.080
speaks directly to the sex do not be conformed 
to this age of darkness but be transformed by  

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.720
the renewing of your mind so this comes back to 
this understanding and he says so you discern  

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:28.400
so you that you may discern what is good what 
is pleasing and what is the perfect will of god  

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:34.240
so part of knowing god's will is renewing your 
mind every day on his word and truth so god  

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:38.720
doesn't simply want you to know again his word 
he wants you to understand it's the difference  

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:42.720
between head knowledge and heart knowledge that's 
the difference between religion and relationship  

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.800
so it takes a relationship with it so we're 
going to look at this last section of 17  

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.720
where he says again so don't be 
foolish but understand the lord's will  

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:58.000
see paul spoke in ephesians 2 10 and i want 
to i want to read this i think it's always  

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.040
good to look back on the textbook study from 
ephesians 2 10 says this it says for we are  

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:08.240
his workmanship created in christ jesus for 
good works that god had prepared beforehand  

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.280
so god has prepared beforehand 
his will to walk him  

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:19.760
good works to walk in what is it what does 
that mean so come back to this is as a church  

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:26.240
we're here to help each one of you and everyone 
that we come in contact to discover god's purpose  

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.600
for the life through a relationship with 
jesus so god reveals his plans and i want  

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.600
to give you a couple of verses and this is just 
a starter and we want to say what's god's will  

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:38.560
this is just the start of what god's will is 
first thessalonians 5 18 says in everything give  

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:44.560
thanks for this is the will of god see if you're 
wondering where god's will is start reading this  

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:50.240
word and he'll tell you as you give thanks to 
him everything you have that's his will so we  

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.360
also know when it comes to prayer what do we pray 
how do we discover god's will well matthew 6 10  

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:01.520
this is jesus teaching his disciples how to pray 
he says pray that your this o father in heaven  

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:07.280
your kingdom come your will be done as it is in 
earth and as it is in heaven right so in prayer  

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:13.200
we ask for god's will to be done and god reveals 
that to us i think of what we the text we covered  

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:18.400
last week matthew 28 19 he says go therefore and 
make disciples of all nations that's god's will  

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:24.080
and so if you're wondering he says understand 
don't just know don't just say i've been in  

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:31.200
church my whole life but walk in and and have 
a relationship with jesus and understand god's  

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.000
will for your life and he says this is wise 
right we've been talking foolishness wise  

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.880
i want to be honest i want to be a wise steward 
of my time that's what paul's speaking to as well  

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:47.760
and so the question is what are we going to do 
about the right it's in plain sight god's will  

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:53.600
is in plain sight god has made you for a purpose 
he's designed you to shine light be children  

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:59.520
of light go live inspired he's designing for 
that what are you gonna do so you may be as we  

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.480
again just summarizing this you may be listening 
to everything that was said today and you're just  

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.000
a lot like me you said a lot of things but 
what does that mean what does that mean  

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.400
it's it's maybe confusing i would hope 
that these things will motivate you

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:19.440
to search maybe you don't know jesus it's it 
motivates you to search and say you know there  

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.760
is more to this life but i don't fully understand 
it but i have questions maybe it's for you as  

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:31.360
a believer you've been walking as though you've 
had time you know you're guaranteed more time and  

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.800
you'll get there you'll follow jesus more i'll be 
more of an obedient follower of jesus tomorrow or  

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.600
the next day maybe you just need to hear that 
today is the day for you to follow me closer if  

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:48.000
you truly want to make your life count and impact 
the world then you need to heed paul's advice to  

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.040
pay careful attention to how you live the world's 
watching other believers are watching and and just  

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.360
to give you a great example the mission team 
that's here this week that helped us this week

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.480
you know i think about someone when i make 
that statement someone's waiting for you on  

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.120
this other side of obedience mission team and 
i guess throughout this room you guys are an  

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:19.520
answer to our prayer you your obedience to come 
as a result of an answer prayer and so we were  

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:24.480
waiting on your obedience to come help us not 
serve this week right isn't that amazing like  

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:31.360
when you think about that but for everybody else 
like what's the response what's the response how  

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:37.200
do we walk away from this changed the question you 
need to ask yourself this and is we're going to  

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.840
have a time of imitation let me just explain what 
that is the time of limitation is where we really  

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.160
consider the things that we heard today maybe it's 
just one thing god spoke to you but we consider  

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.520
the things that we heard today when we asked 
god to apply it to our lives and respond to it  

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:55.120
um but i would challenge you to ask this question 
are you just going through the motions of life  

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.520
are you going through the motions 
of life or is life just happening  

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.040
in your experience or are you paying 
careful attention to how you live  

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:07.760
are you intentionally pursuing jesus 
through a personal relationship with him

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:15.680
and this is just what i quote to you back 
ephesians 5 14 wake up sleeper it's time  

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:22.400
to wake up and realize that today is a special 
day because it's not promised tomorrow someone's  

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.840
waiting all right answer that questions 
how would you live it make your life count  

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.240
but two i just want to challenge you this 
just don't wait if you've never given your  

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:38.800
life to jesus don't wait don't wait i 
sat for a year in a church listening to  

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.680
the pastor tell me the same thing you're not 
promised tomorrow don't wait you know god was  

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.440
gracious and gave me a year to respond 
he was he didn't have to give me a year

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:58.000
but we can't guarantee that year today is the 
day of salvation i just would challenge you if  

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.200
you haven't given the love of christ that today 
is an amazing day to do that if you don't know  

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.280
what that means that's a great question to ask so 
during this invitation what i'd love to be able  

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.840
to do is i'm going to stay in the back i hope that 
that's just inviting to you to come ask questions  

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.400
i'm not forcing you into anything i just want to 
have a conversation what it means to follow jesus  

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:19.680
maybe it's just team prayer maybe you're trying 
to discover exactly your next step we believe  

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:26.240
everybody in here has a next step right to follow 
jesus to live as a fully devoted follower of  

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:31.440
jesus to make a difference and i'd love to be 
able to help you in that if you have questions  

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.920
so let's pray lord jesus thank you again for today 
thank you again for this time to spend the word  

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.760
to be reminded that we need to be careful how 
we live lord and that's that's not careful as  

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:48.800
though we're scared but lord it's really just 
being intentional to know that we need to  

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:55.360
redeem the time we need to make every effort to 
live wisely and to understand your will for our  

00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:00.160
lives lord and we know in the simplest form your 
will is for us to have a relationship with you  

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.840
lord thank you for sending your son jesus 
to dying across the lord for our sins  

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.960
because we were separated from you 
where you could have left us here  

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:14.240
separated from you forever but you didn't because 
you pursued us you pursued us from the moment  

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:20.320
that we were alive or born and you will pursue 
us until the day that we die and i pray today  

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.920
that there's someone in here that doesn't know you 
more than today that we're swallowing or boarded  

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:28.880
they've been following you lord and maybe they've 
just not been fully surrendered um to your will  

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:33.280
and understand that lord i pray that they take a 
next step in discovering that lord and then maybe  

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:42.560
they just come back and talk with me a little bit 
more about that and lord we love you we approach
