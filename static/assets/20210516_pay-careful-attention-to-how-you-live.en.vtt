00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:03.840
that's right i recovered

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.840
over hello

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.840
together

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:59.840
hey

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.840

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.840
yes

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:01.760
uh you work your way back to the scene slowly one&nbsp;
of the things you'll find uh as you continue to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.320
get to know inspiring hope is uh we really love&nbsp;
relationships so um we struggle to get back to

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.640
i enjoy that and the more that we get to build&nbsp;
relationships we believe we're stronger as people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.040
right i think god has designed right relationships&nbsp;
together to encourage one another right and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:32.560
relationship with him and so uh again we love&nbsp;
that with our church to do that but um today we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.440
gonna be in ephesians chapter five um and we're&nbsp;
gonna be starting in verse 15 today if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.360
have a bible with you i encourage you there's&nbsp;
one back here on the main steps table grab it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.320

most people i would lose my bible if i brought to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.200
church every week sorry guys so i bring it on my&nbsp;
phone so download a bible live it's a great way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.520
be able to bring the word with you um each sunday&nbsp;
and or even during the day of whatever you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.080
going about your day so ephesians chapter five&nbsp;
and one of the things i wanted to talk about is

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.200
as we move forward we've been actually walking&nbsp;
through the book of ephesians as we move forward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.040
a lot of times we forget to look back right where&nbsp;
have we been um and so it's it's just it could be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.280
a good time for us to just take a step back and&nbsp;
say what have we what have we been reading what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.320
have we been studying over the last several&nbsp;
several months i think since the beginning of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.560
this year we've been walking through the book of&nbsp;
ephesians so the book of ephesians is wrote by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:34.640
apostle paul um see paul was not an apostle at&nbsp;
one point in his life where god transformed his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.360
life god radically changed his life because what&nbsp;
god did for him he lived his life out for god um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.080
and we are really seeing that in this book to&nbsp;
the ephesians these are writing a letter again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.720
to other believers and he wants to know the&nbsp;
same thing that he knows right all the things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.120
that god has done for him all the things that&nbsp;
god has done for him and so we spent the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.120
three chapters and that's all that paul did in the&nbsp;
first three chapters is really just talked about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.680
all that god has done for us all that god's&nbsp;
divorce and there's two ways to look at this so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.080
as a believer it's all that god has done for us&nbsp;
as somebody who doesn't know christ it's all that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.040
god can do for you so i'll say that again it's&nbsp;
really writing in this this book the first three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.320
chapters is all that god's done for you if you are&nbsp;
a follower of jesus or all that god can do for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.640
if you follow jesus so there's two ways to look&nbsp;
at that so i wanted to be able to highlight some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:29.280
of the things that paul mentioned god has done&nbsp;
for us so he has chosen us again he's chosen us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.840
meaning that he he had the opportunity to leave&nbsp;
us in our condition lost not a relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.840
with god speaking eternity separated from him&nbsp;
but he chose us he adopted us he redeemed us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.120
and he's forgiven us and that's what you'll see&nbsp;
if you're wondering where i'm getting all this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.800
really the first three chapters of ephesians so&nbsp;
i encourage you if you haven't read it lately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.320
after today's message go back and read&nbsp;
the first three chapters of ephesians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.200
you'll get to see a lot of these things one&nbsp;
he he's also given us an inheritance in heaven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.880
and this is a guarantee right i don't know&nbsp;
about you guys but if somebody was to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.920
to me today and say hey so-and-so left you&nbsp;
inheritance i would be thrilled well guess what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.560
through god's word we learned that god has&nbsp;
listened to this inheritance that will never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.680
never go away though it's guaranteed for&nbsp;
us in heaven as we give in our lives to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.200
he says that he has filled us with a promise again&nbsp;
to keep us for eternity he's given us power and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:25.040
unity and grace and mercy he's created us for a&nbsp;
purpose and this is really where we landed from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.640
last week so the first three chapters talked about&nbsp;
all that god's done for us and as a result of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:34.480
what god has done for us we go live as children&nbsp;
of life that's what we talked about last week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.600
in ephesians chapter five we go live as children&nbsp;
of light and one of the ways that we describe that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.880
if you see some of these shirts around here&nbsp;
is go live inspire that's exactly what that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.040
means go live for jesus go live in a way that&nbsp;
shows other people jesus um and so the the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.760
question here then is all that god's done for us&nbsp;
we're supposed to do one imitate jesus how do we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.160
do that and that's exactly what paul did he didn't&nbsp;
just say okay god's almost where you go walk his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.800
children's life he's actually practically talking&nbsp;
about how we go live inspired how we walk his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.600
children's life how we walk and entertain jesus&nbsp;
and so there's two ways he can kind of describe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.160
this in chapter five of things that we should put&nbsp;
off or take off and things that we should put on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.120
as children of life as somebody who would follow&nbsp;
jesus and so the couple of things that he talked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.160
about in chapter five was this we should put these&nbsp;
things off sexual immorality and purity and greed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.120
obscene and foolish talking and cruel joking&nbsp;
and then he says words of darkness and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.200
all these things we were to put off and here was&nbsp;
the big thing that we talked about as we were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.440
talking about the things we should put off why why&nbsp;
should we put those things off because sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.600
those things are fun or sometimes those things are&nbsp;
funny but you know why can't we do that it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.560
valuable for you so he talks about this in verse&nbsp;
11 where he says these things are not beneficial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.960
they're not fruitful they're not valuable for&nbsp;
you so then he says okay here's some things we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.160
should put on those things we should put off as&nbsp;
followers of jesus these things we should put on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.320
as followers of jesus and so he says we should&nbsp;
put on purity we should put on thanksgiving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.400
and he says the fruit of children of life fruit&nbsp;
of someone walking and following god is goodness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:12.080
righteousness and truth and so all the ways that&nbsp;
god wants us to walk and that's guided for us is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.840
in these three words goodness righteousness and&nbsp;
truth and again we walked through that last week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.000
and so all the things that we are really&nbsp;
going to be talking about today rely on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.920
those things and so that's what i don't want us&nbsp;
to miss is we're looking at these three verses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:31.120
15 16 and 17 i was planning to cover more verses&nbsp;
but i literally got through these three verses and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.320
said gotta cut it up there's just so much here&nbsp;
i think that paul's trying to speak to the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.840
people he was writing to with this book but&nbsp;
he's also speaking to us that's what i love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:45.440
about god's word it's timeless which means it&nbsp;
applies to us today and maybe you've read this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.560
text in the past you're like i've already got&nbsp;
it i don't need to hear another message on it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.840
that's not true because god's word is new every&nbsp;
day which means there's different seasons of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.720
life you read a word the word from god word of&nbsp;
god and it really speaks to you differently i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:05.200
hoping and praying as you read today he'll speak&nbsp;
to you a little bit different um with this text&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.720
and so let's look at the verses here and i'll&nbsp;
read those and then we'll jump in and so it says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:17.520
here in verse 15 it says pay careful attention&nbsp;
then how you live not as unwise people but as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:25.600
wise making the most of the time because the days&nbsp;
are evil don't be foolish but understand what the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.400
and so we're lord's will stop right there so let's&nbsp;
pray and uh just ask god to joke in our hearts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:38.880
hear what he has to say for us lord jesus we just&nbsp;
pray lord not for you um to just lord work today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.880
i know that apart from you we can do nothing&nbsp;
and lord i was just reminded as we opened up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.920
this this service and prayer that i felt like&nbsp;
through the whole worship service we were really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.720
just praying we were giving our offering back&nbsp;
to you and so lord i pray that this is another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.680
time that we do that we're listening intently&nbsp;
lord we're listening in order to to know you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:06.400
and to know how to live in a way that others come&nbsp;
to know and so we pray this in your heart amen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.320
so the first thing that we see here and i'm&nbsp;
going to be very practical with you so if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.400
like hey the text you're just really telling me&nbsp;
what the text says that that's good that's good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.360
i don't know you guys it's some of the things&nbsp;
in the bible like we try to overcomplicate but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.440
it really speaks to just practical understanding&nbsp;
i think we're going to learn that a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:31.360
today so he says this pay careful attention&nbsp;
to how you live pay careful attention how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.840
you live see i think about this um anybody&nbsp;
had an overbearing parent growing up anybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.800
i did here's what my mom would say every&nbsp;
day before i got in the car watch out for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.760
the other driver watch out for the other journal&nbsp;
like basically hey watch out who's on the road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:56.160
be very attentive right be very intense be careful&nbsp;
how you drive what did i say to her i know i know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.840
but there were some days it really became numb&nbsp;
right she would say that i was i really attended&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.720
because i was probably blaring the music those&nbsp;
were the days that texting just started and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.640
that may date me but i started making texting&nbsp;
while i was driving so was i really paying careful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.480
attention so these are those moments like you hear&nbsp;
this you know okay great pay careful attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.640
but let's really see why paul is saying pay&nbsp;
careful attention and so when we look at this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:28.000
uh paul is saying again since we're looking at&nbsp;
this in light of what we've studied is um he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.680
saying that since darkness and brokenness is&nbsp;
all around us right all these things we need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:37.440
to put off as followers of crisis all around us&nbsp;
the way that we combat falling into these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.600
is to be careful another word is diligent that&nbsp;
maybe what's in your word is this word diligence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.880
showing constant effort to pursue life goodness&nbsp;
righteousness righteousness and truth so what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.240
the opposite right it's walking careless&nbsp;
without proper guidance and forethought and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:02.080
whatever i think about these things i was actually&nbsp;
driving on friday to sands with my wife and uh we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.400
were driving all of a sudden she said where are&nbsp;
you going i said i don't know and she said well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.160
i thought you knew where you're going with her i&nbsp;
don't have any clue right so i was driving in such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.600
a way that i was careless i had no clue we had 15&nbsp;
minutes down the road away from where sam's was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.840
and so i just thought about this i wasn't i was&nbsp;
just careless in my drive i wasn't even paying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.360
attention i didn't know where i was going i'm&nbsp;
just driving of course we were very quiet for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.080
the next five or 10 minutes and she was angry that&nbsp;
we were a little bit late but it's okay because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:34.000
it actually taught me a lesson right i wasn't&nbsp;
careful at how we were going about life i wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.640
really thinking through to pay careful attention&nbsp;
and so i also think about this those of you who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.760
love sports i'm a sports guy i'm actually going&nbsp;
to leave out of here today uh actually go to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.000
dance recital across the road and then we're going&nbsp;
to go to flight football and help coach that but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.600
let me tell you this is the way i think of things&nbsp;
is my son when he first started playing black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.200
football this season they would play on defense&nbsp;
everybody wants to play on offense everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.480
wants to be the quarterback of the running back i&nbsp;
don't know about you guys but that's typically the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:05.520
two positions everybody wants to lead but when&nbsp;
it comes on defense it's kind of like um right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.960
so here's what would happen we would we would&nbsp;
line up for defense and they would stand like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.160
they weren't like okay great and they would go and&nbsp;
spit and run past them and then they'd get beat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.640
we said no you need to be careful gonna be ready&nbsp;
right you'll be on your toes so that whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.040
the defense or one of the offense comes at you&nbsp;
whenever the enemy comes at you you're ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.320
you're paying careful attention to what&nbsp;
they're doing right you're following the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.840
law you're listening you're a tenant that's&nbsp;
exactly what paul said be ready be careful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:40.560
pay careful attention to how you live it's very&nbsp;
very important that we do that so when we think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.920
about the christian life right we can't take the&nbsp;
christian life for granted we can't take this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.640
life that god has called us to live for granted&nbsp;
and i i make this statement and hopefully the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.400
same thing if you've heard it enough times&nbsp;
at the moment of salvation you've given your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.640
life to christ if god was done with you he would&nbsp;
have taken you to heaven but you're still here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:06.160
the question is why why why are you still here&nbsp;
well because god has a design purpose for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:13.360
for you yeah you and maybe you're wondering can&nbsp;
god use you absolutely i would just dare you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.560
go study a little bit of the bible and you'll&nbsp;
see a lot of the broken people and struggling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:22.080
people who didn't have all the greatest gifts who&nbsp;
were just willing to follow god and god houston&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.360
so what i would say is we can't go through&nbsp;
life by chance we have to pay careful attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.840
the decisions that we're making need to be wise&nbsp;
and that's that second part of this verse we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.080
going to jump into but i want us to jump back&nbsp;
and look at verse 14 for just a second because it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:42.960
really speaks to this so paul says this coming out&nbsp;
of last week's test he says get up sleeper rise up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.240
from the dead and christ will shine on you so when&nbsp;
we think about paying careful attention someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.800
who is asleep or half a sleep is not really paying&nbsp;
careful attention and this is what i thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.720
anybody ever got up in the middle of the knife&nbsp;
especially when you're sitting in a new place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.760
and you have your eyes closed you've got to go&nbsp;
your eyes are closed and you run into the wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.960
right we're asleep we're half asleep we're&nbsp;
just kind of fumbling through life that's what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.800
paul's saying here pay careful attention&nbsp;
open your eyes wake up sleeper god's got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:21.200
a purpose for you don't miss it don't&nbsp;
miss it so i i want to ask this question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.120
you can answer it to yourself we'll ask this&nbsp;
question do you want to make your life count

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:34.880
do you really want your life to matter and in&nbsp;
the span of eternity that you did something worth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:43.760
value anybody i know i do and that's exactly why&nbsp;
i'm here and i believe why many of you are here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:49.680
because you want to make your life count see paul&nbsp;
is writing to other believers who are dealing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.880
with some persecution dealing with some struggles&nbsp;
knowing these things are coming battling darkness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:00.320
and worldly things that are drawing away and&nbsp;
he's saying i want your life to matter pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:06.400
careful attention to how you live so then paul&nbsp;
begins to walk through this he lists several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.200
reasons why we should pay careful attention to&nbsp;
our lives and how we walk and he starts with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:17.840
second part of 15 so he says pay careful attention&nbsp;
then to how you live not as unwise people but as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:23.200
wives so the first thing that paul's saying is&nbsp;
we should pay careful attention to how we live is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.720
because it's a mark of wisdom i'll tell you this i&nbsp;
like being around wise people they make me smarter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.760
i'm drawn to them right when they do things that&nbsp;
are really good or valuable and like i want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:39.600
know how they did and so what paul's saying is&nbsp;
live as wise as unwise people right it's a mark of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.800
wisdom um and so people who are paying careful&nbsp;
attention to their lives that are intentionally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.920
living their lifestyle are wise they're&nbsp;
not unwise um and so we should be known as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:57.840
wise people because it points other people&nbsp;
to jesus and uh i think about this when it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:04.320
comes to building a house a wise builder first&nbsp;
puts the plans together right he sets up plans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.400
together so he knows how he's going to build the&nbsp;
house what it looks like what he has to measure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.320
out for he doesn't just randomly go and say i'm&nbsp;
gonna grab some pieces of wood and go out this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:19.520
he's intentional about how he does he's wise about&nbsp;
how he does it yet how many of us plan our days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.960
and use them in such a way that is wise that&nbsp;
will make the greatest difference i mean i i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.400
just want to know how many of you wake up and&nbsp;
say today i'm going to wisely invest my time if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.320
this is the last day i lived and this is how i'm&nbsp;
planning it out so i can make the greatest impact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:44.480
i don't think i can raise my hand and here's&nbsp;
the reason why most of the time i don't i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.240
just jump into things and i start going and&nbsp;
then at the end of the day i wonder if i even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.640
accomplished anything that was beneficial&nbsp;
for me or even for for the kingdom of god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.920
and so paul's saying wise people pay attention why&nbsp;
is people pay careful attention to how they live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:08.560
because they know their life matters their life&nbsp;
has a purpose so i think about this when it comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.600
to gun should anybody shoot at a target that he's&nbsp;
targeting shooting either with an arrow or a gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:19.920
you ever done it before any of you ever shot just&nbsp;
to shoot not true to targets like just randomly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:25.040
like you're just like that would be careless right&nbsp;
no we have a target in life to shoot out god has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:31.760
a target in life for us to follow him and aim&nbsp;
and and purposely carefully aim at and shoot at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:38.080
yet i think about this many of us carry a title&nbsp;
of being a christian but our lives don't match&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.400
that time our lives are aiming at the wrong heart&nbsp;
is we're not even in that target at all and i've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.760
read this and i'm going to move on to the next one&nbsp;
but matthew 7 24-27 really speaks directly to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.040
he says therefore everyone who hears these words&nbsp;
of mine this is jesus speaking everyone who hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:00.640
these words of mine so he hears me and acts on&nbsp;
him so follows through with him is a wise man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:06.160
who built his house on a rock the rain fell and&nbsp;
the rivers rose and the winds blew and pounded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:12.800
on the house yet it didn't collapse because its&nbsp;
foundation was on the rock but everyone who hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:20.160
these words and doesn't act on it is a foolish man&nbsp;
unwise basically who has built his house on sand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.640
the rain fell the rivers rose so the winds&nbsp;
blew and pounded on the house and it collapsed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:32.480
and there was a great crash so we see here that&nbsp;
for us again looking in light of of the life that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:39.440
we are living that we know god has given you today&nbsp;
to live and nothing more guaranteed we should live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.800
and pay careful attention to how we live

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.000
talking through this he says that we&nbsp;
should pay careful attention to how we live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.640
because it's a mark of wisdom but then he goes&nbsp;
on and he says this is also because life is short&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.800
verse 16 let's just look at verse 16 the first&nbsp;
part of it he says making the most of your time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.800
making the most of your time so something&nbsp;
you have in your in the bible where it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.960
says redeeming the time psalm 90 12 says&nbsp;
this teach us to number our days carefully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:20.240
so that we may develop wisdom in our hearts see i&nbsp;
i would say that that's exactly the psalmist there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:27.920
is exactly affirming what paul is saying make sure&nbsp;
you're careful of how you live your life because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.080
we need to make the most of our time we&nbsp;
don't know how many more days we have

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.880
but we look at this and we think through&nbsp;
this and i started thinking through this like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:49.280
do you realize that seriously tomorrow you don't&nbsp;
wake up like i mean i know i don't like being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.040
morbid like i don't want to be that guy i don't&nbsp;
work with that guy's life every day i'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.000
to die tomorrow so better live it up today but&nbsp;
really what we're seeing here is when you live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.240
what i would call it in short segments which says&nbsp;
every day you live is every day is your last day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.960
how would you live so i want to ask that question&nbsp;
seriously and so this is the part where you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.920
gonna learn more about us i like asking questions&nbsp;
i'm gonna stop and listen to y'all answer this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:21.840
so if you have one day to live this is your&nbsp;
last day tell me what you do what would you do

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:55.680
hearts anybody else here's your last day&nbsp;
to live how would you love this thing

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:07.280
do you remember last week we were studying uh&nbsp;
matthew 28 and we said this is one of the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:13.360
conversations jesus had with his followers and&nbsp;
some of the times people's last words are some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:19.120
of the most important words to listen to this is&nbsp;
the great commission that came out of that right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.160
a lot of people that they're on their&nbsp;
deathbed as they wish they would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.000
cherished moments with their family they wish&nbsp;
they would have had more conversations or they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.440
would have done this or they would have done that&nbsp;
right and so when we're thinking about if this was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.280
the last day to live the questions i started&nbsp;
asking myself is how would we treat our family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.480
and spend time with him who would you go visit&nbsp;
who would you tell here's important who would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.560
you know about jesus knowing that you may be the&nbsp;
only person to get the opportunity to tell them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.280
would you get into petty arguments like&nbsp;
me and my wife seems to get over like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.200
it could be some during the floor the next thing&nbsp;
you know what's this big argument would you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:03.200
in those anymore or would you say it's not&nbsp;
worth it it's my last day um what about this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:10.160
would you put off giving your life to jesus&nbsp;
because i'm i'm telling you there's times that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.400
we disable tomorrow next week would you put off&nbsp;
giving your life to jesus if you knew tomorrow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.200
you weren't guaranteed to turn me in heaven with&nbsp;
him let me share this story with you so my grandpa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.560
um about two years ago passed away and uh me&nbsp;
and my family were actually getting ready to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:32.480
go on vacation doing the hospital at that point&nbsp;
everything was fine um so we start traveling to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.480
florida and uh he's getting a little bit worse&nbsp;
we get a chance to talk to them on the phone on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:43.120
our way to florida but while we're in florida they&nbsp;
actually end up having to come in he's not doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.440
well so we decided to end our vacation early&nbsp;
we'll travel back we travel overnight we leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.200
about seven pm we're going to travel all the way&nbsp;
back to oklahoma that's when we lived in oklahoma&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.000
so you're talking 17 18 hours but we're going to&nbsp;
do a straight shot we did a short shot with all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.440
our kids um we get back um 80 a.m in that morning&nbsp;
my sister's going to come over we're going to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.760
up to see my grandpa i jump in the shower and come&nbsp;
out and my sister's been and my grandfather passed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:14.640
away see i realized i missed the moment right&nbsp;
i missed the moment to go see it one more time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:22.080
and i think about this how many people come to the&nbsp;
end of their lives not knowing that tomorrow's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.800
last day they're gonna live and they missed the&nbsp;
moment they missed the moment to live as though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.920
today is the last day that they would ever live&nbsp;
and they would say these things they wouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.880
want to say and they would accept the things&nbsp;
they know they need to accept like jesus they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:40.640
would tell others about the things that mean the&nbsp;
most of them right how many times there's people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:45.120
all over the world that don't know tomorrow's&nbsp;
the last day and today they live is that they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:51.600
guaranteed one see i just think about those&nbsp;
moments like that i don't want you i don't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.480
this city that we're trying to reach to live one&nbsp;
more day apart from the relationship with jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.760
where they truly understand that you are designed&nbsp;
every one of you are designed for a purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:08.240
to love god a relationship with him but to help&nbsp;
others experience that love and hope in the midst&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:15.120
of trials in the midst of struggling that's&nbsp;
exactly where paul's getting made the most of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:20.960
your time make the most of your time and here's&nbsp;
why he says this because the days are people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.800
see this is where we realize is that in that day&nbsp;
of paul there's lots of persecution for christians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.560
for for other people he understood how important&nbsp;
it was not to take for granted what opportunities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.240
he would have see he's writing from prison just&nbsp;
so you know paul's writing this letter from prison&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.160
and paul had no clue if he was going to get&nbsp;
executed the next day or not he kept pinning the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.000
letter because he wanted to make his life count&nbsp;
he wanted to make sure he got as much truth out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.760
there for others to be changed and so he says you&nbsp;
know these days are evil and so i think about this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:57.120
when we know that the days are people i mean i&nbsp;
don't i most people i talk to know this i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.600
the world's not in a great situation we'd love&nbsp;
to think maybe it is but it's really not and i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:06.080
not turning again debbie down on this it's not&nbsp;
and it's not getting any better right now and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.960
it's just a sense of what's going to go on and&nbsp;
here's what paul's saying i've been there before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.520
the days are evil so this is the question when&nbsp;
as a follower of jesus most of times we're like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.160
we're good man if persecution comes and i die&nbsp;
and going to heaven but what about the person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:27.760
that's waiting on you the days are evil so it's&nbsp;
not about us being concerned about ourselves but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.640
it's this point where it's about being concerned&nbsp;
about others paul's saying the days are evil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.160
pay careful attention to how you&nbsp;
live make the most of your time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.560
because someone is waiting for&nbsp;
you on the other side of obedience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:47.840
somebody's waiting on you to live today as though&nbsp;
it's your blessing i mean how impactful is it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.160
i'm gonna step out here with you because i i&nbsp;
understand the thoughts that go through your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.200
head well isn't god sovereign enough that he's&nbsp;
already got somebody in place to lead everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.200
to faith in him at one point so i don't have&nbsp;
to do anything i mean he's got other people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.400
and you know what i'm talking about my&nbsp;
wife reading about this two days ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:12.160
i said you know god is soft but every day he's&nbsp;
inviting you to be a part of that sovereignty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:17.440
and if you don't we'll have an esther story right&nbsp;
what did mordecai tell esther and i know if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.960
don't know this context i'll tell you where&nbsp;
it is after service this is what more guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:26.400
said because esther had the ability to save her&nbsp;
people if you don't do it esther god will raise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.560
up somebody that does and you know what as you&nbsp;
chose to be she chose to be part of god's story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:39.040
days are you paul's saying make the most&nbsp;
of your time he's giving you the gift if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.480
you give your life to jesus he's giving you the&nbsp;
gift of salvation what are you gonna do with it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.600
what are you gonna do with it how do you live&nbsp;
today as though it's your last day who are you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.000
gonna go talk to who you're gonna love are you&nbsp;
gonna forgive oh man who you're gonna forgive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.560
make your life count this is&nbsp;
exactly where paul is getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.400
and i just think about this there's someone&nbsp;
waiting for me on the other side of obedience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:08.320
don't leave them away don't leave me i just i&nbsp;
want to challenge you this why are we why are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.680
we here today because of one separate weekends&nbsp;
after another there's many people in this room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.960
who have done things in order to have said yes to&nbsp;
things in order to see god's glory god's ability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.840
of his relationship to be shared with everybody&nbsp;
around this city and in our spiritual fields&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.880
and and what i would say is this you're&nbsp;
part of that story and today god's asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:34.000
you to take another step and be a part of&nbsp;
that story we have a city waiting on us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.720
there's someone waiting on me and we have a city&nbsp;
waiting on us to live today so it's our last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.080
so paul lists these reasons again why we&nbsp;
should pay careful attention to how we live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.400
right it's a mark of wisdom because&nbsp;
life is short because the days are evil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.440
and here's one that you're gonna go what let's&nbsp;
look at it he says because god has given us a mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:59.840
to do what with let's look at verse 17 he says so&nbsp;
don't be foolish and again i think if he's saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.680
don't be foolish don't be unwise he's being very&nbsp;
particular here right he wants us to make sure we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:08.800
get this he says don't be foolish but understand&nbsp;
what the lord's will is this word understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:17.040
is more than just no right to understand the&nbsp;
lord's will is to discover again god's purpose for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:23.680
you to follow in obedience to actually act on what&nbsp;
god has told you so you may have heard god's heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.560
you may have heard that god has saved you but are&nbsp;
you walking in them have you heard that god has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:34.240
sent you to go tell other people about jesus but&nbsp;
are you acting on that so he's given us this mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:41.200
and then he says to search out basically what&nbsp;
the lord's will is anybody in here ever asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.720
and i just wish i knew what the lord's will&nbsp;
for i've asked my life lot of times even as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:50.800
a pastor passed out a lot of times and&nbsp;
you know what god reminds me every time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:57.840
that it's not a mystical experience or&nbsp;
something that he's hiding from us god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:04.640
has clearly saved his will for your life if&nbsp;
you want to find it if you want to discover it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.480
and so he he does that through a couple of&nbsp;
different things he does that through his word&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.880
through a prayer but also i would say&nbsp;
this overarching school it's relationship

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.800
again either hopefully this makes sense&nbsp;
to you there was this girl when i was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.760
in high school that used to come get&nbsp;
breakfast every morning and i worked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.120
this girl so you know it's my future wife but

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.480
um i wanted to know like i knew of her

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:38.720
so i got to know her because i really&nbsp;
wanted to know her so that took time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.680
i had asked a lot of questions i took her on&nbsp;
dates we had conversations and i got to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:49.280
her i watched the activities she did and i just&nbsp;
i desired to know more and today there's probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:54.320
not anything i can't tell you about her because&nbsp;
she's an amazing woman who has amazing gifts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:59.920
and i'm thankful it happened so because i&nbsp;
really cared i had a relationship with my wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.560
so do you want to know jesus do you really&nbsp;
want to know god's purpose for your life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:10.400
do you really want to fully understand god's&nbsp;
will have a relationship him through what his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:17.120
word through and just been there you ever&nbsp;
get this word like i don't know what that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.640
this is saying i've been there it takes time&nbsp;
i mean we're sitting here worshiping today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.080
and i think back to the days when i first&nbsp;
started worship worshiping as a believer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.200
i didn't have any clue what those words&nbsp;
meant i still shared this story i was at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.920
a meeting and there was this promotion that&nbsp;
came up the lord suffered and i turned to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.000
my wife and said what what mill do we need to&nbsp;
bring i didn't understand the word sufferings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.120
that's okay right we're learning this is the&nbsp;
part of our relationship early on with my life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.200
whenever i started today here i didn't know much&nbsp;
about her but now her favorite color is blue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.320
i know she loves kids i know that she is a&nbsp;
committed follower of jesus there's so much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:54.320 --> 00:34:00.400
more that i knew as i spent time with her so it&nbsp;
does take time but let me share this romans 12 1-2&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:07.520
says therefore brothers and sisters in view of the&nbsp;
mercies of god i urge you to present your body as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:12.800
a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to god this&nbsp;
is your true worship and so he says this and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.080
speaks directly to the sex do not be conformed&nbsp;
to this age of darkness but be transformed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.720
the renewing of your mind so this comes back to&nbsp;
this understanding and he says so you discern&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:28.400
so you that you may discern what is good what&nbsp;
is pleasing and what is the perfect will of god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:34.240
so part of knowing god's will is renewing your&nbsp;
mind every day on his word and truth so god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:38.720
doesn't simply want you to know again his word&nbsp;
he wants you to understand it's the difference&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:42.720
between head knowledge and heart knowledge that's&nbsp;
the difference between religion and relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.800
so it takes a relationship with it so we're&nbsp;
going to look at this last section of 17&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.720
where he says again so don't be&nbsp;
foolish but understand the lord's will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:58.000
see paul spoke in ephesians 2 10 and i want&nbsp;
to i want to read this i think it's always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.040
good to look back on the textbook study from&nbsp;
ephesians 2 10 says this it says for we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:08.240
his workmanship created in christ jesus for&nbsp;
good works that god had prepared beforehand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.280
so god has prepared beforehand&nbsp;
his will to walk him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:19.760
good works to walk in what is it what does&nbsp;
that mean so come back to this is as a church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:26.240
we're here to help each one of you and everyone&nbsp;
that we come in contact to discover god's purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.600
for the life through a relationship with&nbsp;
jesus so god reveals his plans and i want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.600
to give you a couple of verses and this is just&nbsp;
a starter and we want to say what's god's will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:38.560
this is just the start of what god's will is&nbsp;
first thessalonians 5 18 says in everything give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:44.560
thanks for this is the will of god see if you're&nbsp;
wondering where god's will is start reading this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:50.240
word and he'll tell you as you give thanks to&nbsp;
him everything you have that's his will so we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.360
also know when it comes to prayer what do we pray&nbsp;
how do we discover god's will well matthew 6 10&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:01.520
this is jesus teaching his disciples how to pray&nbsp;
he says pray that your this o father in heaven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:07.280
your kingdom come your will be done as it is in&nbsp;
earth and as it is in heaven right so in prayer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:13.200
we ask for god's will to be done and god reveals&nbsp;
that to us i think of what we the text we covered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:18.400
last week matthew 28 19 he says go therefore and&nbsp;
make disciples of all nations that's god's will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:24.080
and so if you're wondering he says understand&nbsp;
don't just know don't just say i've been in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:31.200
church my whole life but walk in and and have&nbsp;
a relationship with jesus and understand god's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.000
will for your life and he says this is wise&nbsp;
right we've been talking foolishness wise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.880
i want to be honest i want to be a wise steward&nbsp;
of my time that's what paul's speaking to as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:47.760
and so the question is what are we going to do&nbsp;
about the right it's in plain sight god's will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:53.600
is in plain sight god has made you for a purpose&nbsp;
he's designed you to shine light be children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:59.520
of light go live inspired he's designing for&nbsp;
that what are you gonna do so you may be as we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.480
again just summarizing this you may be listening&nbsp;
to everything that was said today and you're just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.000
a lot like me you said a lot of things but&nbsp;
what does that mean what does that mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.400
it's it's maybe confusing i would hope&nbsp;
that these things will motivate you

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:19.440
to search maybe you don't know jesus it's it&nbsp;
motivates you to search and say you know there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.760
is more to this life but i don't fully understand&nbsp;
it but i have questions maybe it's for you as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:31.360
a believer you've been walking as though you've&nbsp;
had time you know you're guaranteed more time and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.800
you'll get there you'll follow jesus more i'll be&nbsp;
more of an obedient follower of jesus tomorrow or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.600
the next day maybe you just need to hear that&nbsp;
today is the day for you to follow me closer if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:48.000
you truly want to make your life count and impact&nbsp;
the world then you need to heed paul's advice to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.040
pay careful attention to how you live the world's&nbsp;
watching other believers are watching and and just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.360
to give you a great example the mission team&nbsp;
that's here this week that helped us this week

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.480
you know i think about someone when i make&nbsp;
that statement someone's waiting for you on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.120
this other side of obedience mission team and&nbsp;
i guess throughout this room you guys are an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:19.520
answer to our prayer you your obedience to come&nbsp;
as a result of an answer prayer and so we were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:24.480
waiting on your obedience to come help us not&nbsp;
serve this week right isn't that amazing like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:31.360
when you think about that but for everybody else&nbsp;
like what's the response what's the response how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:37.200
do we walk away from this changed the question you&nbsp;
need to ask yourself this and is we're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.840
have a time of imitation let me just explain what&nbsp;
that is the time of limitation is where we really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.160
consider the things that we heard today maybe it's&nbsp;
just one thing god spoke to you but we consider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.520
the things that we heard today when we asked&nbsp;
god to apply it to our lives and respond to it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:55.120
um but i would challenge you to ask this question&nbsp;
are you just going through the motions of life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.520
are you going through the motions&nbsp;
of life or is life just happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.040
in your experience or are you paying&nbsp;
careful attention to how you live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:07.760
are you intentionally pursuing jesus&nbsp;
through a personal relationship with him

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:15.680
and this is just what i quote to you back&nbsp;
ephesians 5 14 wake up sleeper it's time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:22.400
to wake up and realize that today is a special&nbsp;
day because it's not promised tomorrow someone's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.840
waiting all right answer that questions&nbsp;
how would you live it make your life count&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.240
but two i just want to challenge you this&nbsp;
just don't wait if you've never given your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:38.800
life to jesus don't wait don't wait i&nbsp;
sat for a year in a church listening to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.680
the pastor tell me the same thing you're not&nbsp;
promised tomorrow don't wait you know god was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.440
gracious and gave me a year to respond&nbsp;
he was he didn't have to give me a year

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:58.000
but we can't guarantee that year today is the&nbsp;
day of salvation i just would challenge you if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.200
you haven't given the love of christ that today&nbsp;
is an amazing day to do that if you don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.280
what that means that's a great question to ask so&nbsp;
during this invitation what i'd love to be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.840
to do is i'm going to stay in the back i hope that&nbsp;
that's just inviting to you to come ask questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.400
i'm not forcing you into anything i just want to&nbsp;
have a conversation what it means to follow jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:19.680
maybe it's just team prayer maybe you're trying&nbsp;
to discover exactly your next step we believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:26.240
everybody in here has a next step right to follow&nbsp;
jesus to live as a fully devoted follower of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:31.440
jesus to make a difference and i'd love to be&nbsp;
able to help you in that if you have questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.920
so let's pray lord jesus thank you again for today&nbsp;
thank you again for this time to spend the word&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.760
to be reminded that we need to be careful how&nbsp;
we live lord and that's that's not careful as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:48.800
though we're scared but lord it's really just&nbsp;
being intentional to know that we need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:55.360
redeem the time we need to make every effort to&nbsp;
live wisely and to understand your will for our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:00.160
lives lord and we know in the simplest form your&nbsp;
will is for us to have a relationship with you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.840
lord thank you for sending your son jesus&nbsp;
to dying across the lord for our sins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.960
because we were separated from you&nbsp;
where you could have left us here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:14.240
separated from you forever but you didn't because&nbsp;
you pursued us you pursued us from the moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:20.320
that we were alive or born and you will pursue&nbsp;
us until the day that we die and i pray today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.920
that there's someone in here that doesn't know you&nbsp;
more than today that we're swallowing or boarded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:28.880
they've been following you lord and maybe they've&nbsp;
just not been fully surrendered um to your will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:33.280
and understand that lord i pray that they take a&nbsp;
next step in discovering that lord and then maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:42.560
they just come back and talk with me a little bit&nbsp;
more about that and lord we love you we approach
