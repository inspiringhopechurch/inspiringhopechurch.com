00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.330
All right, guys, we're gonna go
ahead and jump in and get started.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.120
Um, it's great to see each
one of you excited to be back.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.780
I know last week we had what we
called our serve Sunday, which was

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.020
we were gonna serve our own community
and have people in community groups.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.860
And I think majority of people were
out of town or did not attend that.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.160
So that was not a huge.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.120
Win.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.130
But we had a huge win by
the group that we had.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.420
I know they had a wonderful time.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.970
I got a lot of good feedback,
so glad that they got to meet.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.960
I know our kids did.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.430
We had, um, kids, uh, at kids camp last
weekend and they had an amazing time.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.960
So we had an awesome time, but after two
weeks Subaru pump to be back here today,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.660
as we start again, our new series over
our mission and our strategy as a church.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.210
And so we're gonna be in Matthew
chapter four versus 18 through 20.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.519
And so, um, I, I wanna remind
you of this, cuz we're gonna talk

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:57.779
about this every single week.

00:00:57.779 --> 00:01:01.919
Why number one, why are we
starting this new series?

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.459
Well, it's been about a little over a
year since we've really even talked a lot

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.280
about this and who we are as a church.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.979
And I think it's important because,
you know, as a church we've been

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.920
launched for a little over a year and
a half and, and we have those who are,

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.210
have been here since the beginning.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.170
And we have some of you that are newer
and, and my encouragement over this next

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.570
several weeks is to, to start engaging.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.830
What I would say those who are newer
to be more involved in what God is

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.360
doing here, and then to be a part of
inviting, including all of us, inviting

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.740
more people into what we're doing.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.850
So the best way to be a part of that
is to know what you're being a part of.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.690
Number two is to, um, what I would say is.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.610
Just almost like, I need to
remember things at times.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.759
So I need to kind of like go back over
it and go know who are we as a church

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:46.960
and why are we doing these things?

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.940
And so I feel like it's just
gonna be a good refresher for

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.140
every one of us, including myself.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.720
So I'm, I'm pumped about
walking through this series.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.740
I hope you are.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.320
Um, and so that's why I encourage
a couple weeks ago is don't

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.210
miss the next several weeks.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.100
As we walk through this and hope
that your take notes or take

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.740
something that you can take from
this, and it'd be of value to you.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.500
But we are a church that
exists to inspire hope.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.110
And I always tell people this
question, how do you inspire hope?

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.100
The only way you'll ever inspire
hope is to be inspired yourself.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.220
Um, when we inspire hope to help
people discover their purpose,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.450
we believe that God has given
every single person in this world.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.030
And let's just narrow this
down to inspiring hope.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.420
Everybody in here has
been given a purpose from.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.300
To be discovered through
a relationship with him.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.260
And so again, in order to be able to
inspire others, we have to start there.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.100
And I think at times, um, anybody ever
heard this statement before we get

00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:42.210
the cart before the horse, I think at
times we try to attempt to do something

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.730
before we're even understanding what
we're doing or like even ready to do.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.810
And so.

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:52.725
I hope today that as those, if there's
somebody in this room that hasn't

00:02:52.725 --> 00:02:55.605
given their lives to Christ that
maybe that's a starting point for you.

00:02:55.605 --> 00:02:58.815
And if you have given your life
to Christ, then the next starting

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.745
point for you is helping inspire
others to discover that same hope.

00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:03.915
In that.

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:07.935
And so our strategy, I mentioned this
earlier, but our strategy is to follow

00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:11.235
Jesus, live in communities, serve those
around us and expand God's kingdom.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.175
If you're wondering where that is,
we put this up here every week to

00:03:14.175 --> 00:03:18.225
kind of remind us what our strategy
is, uh, each and every week.

00:03:18.495 --> 00:03:21.775
And so today we're gonna talk about that
first part, which is following Jesus.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:28.845
I want just to remind you this, everything
we do as a church is about helping

00:03:28.845 --> 00:03:31.035
others follow Jesus, everything we.

00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:35.415
And if it isn't, then we're
probably doing something.

00:03:36.525 --> 00:03:40.755
and so, so that's just even a reminder
to me to evaluate everything we do

00:03:40.995 --> 00:03:44.985
is to teach you, to teach myself,
to follow Jesus more and more.

00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:45.255
Right.

00:03:45.285 --> 00:03:48.465
And I think that's what we
should be motivated to do and

00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:50.655
dedicated to do as a church.

00:03:50.655 --> 00:03:52.905
And that's why I wanted
to choose this text.

00:03:52.905 --> 00:03:54.135
As we are looking at this today.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.770
And we're gonna walk through it and we're
gonna learn what it means to follow Jesus.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.920
And we're gonna talk about what
it looks like to follow Jesus.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.710
And so let me read the text and
then I'm gonna kind of set it up.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.790
So again, Matthew chapter four
versus 18 through 22, and it says

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.070
this, as he speaking to Jesus was
walking along the sea of Galilee.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.930
He saw two brothers Simon who
was called Peter and his brother,

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.100
Andrew, who was casting Annette into
the sea for, they were fishermen.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.300
He said, follow me.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.030
He told them, and I will
make you fish for people.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.560
And immediately they left their
nets and followed them going on.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.550
From there, he saw two others or two
other brothers, James and the son

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.170
of Zebedee and his brother, John.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.320
They were in the boat with Zebedee,
their father preparing their nets

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.610
and he called them immediately.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:42.640
They left their boat.

00:04:43.905 --> 00:04:45.705
And their father and they followed them.

00:04:46.065 --> 00:04:47.745
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:51.315
We just pray Lord that you open our
hearts and minds to your word today.

00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:54.795
Lord, I pray that you change me, that
you change each person in this room, Lord

00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:59.085
in, in a way that is, uh, where we grow
closer and closer to you and we learn

00:04:59.085 --> 00:05:02.265
more and more how to follow you, Lord,
the way you've called us to follow you.

00:05:02.595 --> 00:05:03.915
And so we just pray this near heaven name.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.460
So the first thing I wanna do
is kind of set up this text.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.500
Where is Jesus coming from?

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.070
Well, Jesus, um, actually, there's,
Matthew's kind of quick with this.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.440
He was born, John, the Baptist was born.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.920
All of a sudden they meet up whenever
he's older, he gets baptized by

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.280
John the Baptist and he comes up
out of the water and he's sent

00:05:23.285 --> 00:05:24.690
into the wilderness for 40 days.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.870
Right.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.910
He fasted for 40 days and 40 nights.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.520
He was tempted by the enemy and
he rejected all those temptations.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.740
And this is right after that, right.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.330
When his ministry begins.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.240
And this is the, the verse right
before the verse that we just read

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.090
that it says, it says, and from then
on Jesus begin to preach repent because

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.740
the kingdom of heaven has come near.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.620
So Jesus' ministry has just started.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.130
And one of the coolest parts of Jesus'
ministry is he didn't wanna do it.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.770
see Jesus had the power and the ability
to accomplish the mission, which is to

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.780
help other people discover who Jesus is
and why he came and why he had to die.

00:06:03.785 --> 00:06:05.400
And that he was there
to pay for their sins.

00:06:05.405 --> 00:06:06.810
And to give them a relationship with God.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.670
Again, Jesus could have done that all
on his home, but he said, you know what?

00:06:10.724 --> 00:06:13.635
. I want some people to come alongside
me and, and accomplish this

00:06:13.635 --> 00:06:15.865
mission and, and, and interesting.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.005
He starts with these fishermen
as he begins to walk by.

00:06:19.185 --> 00:06:19.425
Right.

00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:21.435
And as he begins to, to, to look at this.

00:06:21.435 --> 00:06:25.305
And so his mission was to bring hope
of the gospel to everyone, right.

00:06:25.305 --> 00:06:28.335
To, and then include other people
to help them fulfill their purpose.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.355
So, so true or false.

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:30.825
I wanna ask this question true or false.

00:06:31.844 --> 00:06:33.735
Everyone who gives their
life to Jesus right?

00:06:33.735 --> 00:06:38.715
Or follows Jesus is called to
help fulfill the mission to share

00:06:38.715 --> 00:06:39.914
the hope of Jesus with the world.

00:06:39.974 --> 00:06:41.655
Is that true or false?

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:44.355
I'd hope you say it's true.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.685
Right?

00:06:44.685 --> 00:06:49.005
Anybody that's given their life to
Jesus is part of helping fulfill

00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:52.185
the mission that Jesus came to
fulfill, which is to help other

00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:53.895
people discover the hope of Jesus.

00:06:53.895 --> 00:06:54.224
Right.

00:06:54.645 --> 00:06:57.015
So it kind of goes back to
this idea of why we are.

00:06:58.125 --> 00:07:02.025
here to inspire hope to, to be inspired
ourselves, to follow Jesus, right.

00:07:02.025 --> 00:07:04.695
And to help other people follow
Jesus is because that's just

00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:05.745
what everybody's called to do.

00:07:06.255 --> 00:07:09.105
And this is where we begin to
see Jesus calling the first

00:07:09.105 --> 00:07:10.515
couple of people to do that.

00:07:10.725 --> 00:07:12.615
So we're gonna kind of
expand on this idea.

00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:17.265
So the first thing that we're gonna
see here, and this is, I, I didn't

00:07:17.265 --> 00:07:20.115
initially have this in my notes, but
I went back over and I saw this and I

00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:21.135
thought, I thought it was really cool.

00:07:21.405 --> 00:07:25.065
The first thing that we see in
this text is that God sees us.

00:07:25.635 --> 00:07:27.945
So look at it, it says this, and I'm gonna
kinda, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:30.044
take both of these two stories, right.

00:07:30.044 --> 00:07:33.434
Of him, uh, calling both of these
two brothers, we're gonna kind

00:07:33.434 --> 00:07:34.364
of walk through them together.

00:07:34.364 --> 00:07:40.364
So in verses 18 and 21, it basically
says this as he, Jesus was walking along

00:07:40.364 --> 00:07:43.005
the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers.

00:07:43.065 --> 00:07:43.244
Right?

00:07:43.244 --> 00:07:44.505
And let me read verse 21.

00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:48.375
He says going on from there,
he saw two other brothers.

00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:53.174
See, in this story, Jesus saw people.

00:07:54.164 --> 00:07:57.405
He was always looking for people.

00:07:58.065 --> 00:07:59.594
He was always caring for people.

00:07:59.685 --> 00:08:01.365
He was always compassionate to people.

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:06.854
And in this instance, he was looking
for people to join him on the mission,

00:08:06.854 --> 00:08:10.875
to help other people discover who
Jesus is, the hope of the gospel.

00:08:12.044 --> 00:08:16.664
And I started thinking this
hasn't stopped today every day.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.870
Jesus sees you.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.140
And that may seem eerie because
y'all know we end up in the

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.300
bathroom and in the shower and
we're like, Jesus sees us right now.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.050
This is a little bit awkward, but
it's nothing he ain't seen before.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.560
Right.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.730
But the point is that he always sees
us and he has not stopped looking

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.720
for people to join his mission.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.330
I, I got, I got another question for you.

00:08:39.914 --> 00:08:42.405
Anybody here, like being a part of
something that's bigger than yourself.

00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:45.614
Like, that's so cool that, you know, can't
be accomplished by yourself, but that you

00:08:45.614 --> 00:08:48.915
get to be part of something bigger guys.

00:08:48.915 --> 00:08:54.194
That's what Jesus has invited us into
to be a part of this big mission, to

00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:58.995
all these billions of people around the
world, to help them in their time of need,

00:08:59.745 --> 00:09:03.045
where, where they struggle with having
hope when they struggle with having a

00:09:03.045 --> 00:09:07.724
purpose, when they struggle with figuring
out why they were ex were basically born.

00:09:08.355 --> 00:09:10.755
We are part of that mission.

00:09:10.755 --> 00:09:13.185
And Jesus sees us where we are.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.310
So it was interesting and I'll
just kinda start this way.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.060
I was, I was having students stand up and
teachers and staff and administrators,

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:26.040
and I felt like, I think the majority
of like our church is somehow kids

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.510
were involved in that somewhere.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:27.690
Right.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.100
Not majority, but me at least half.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:29.400
Right.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.260
So God sees students and teachers,
he sees contractors and welders and

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.709
principals and stay-at-home moms,
and he sees these fishermen, right.

00:09:37.715 --> 00:09:39.449
Fishermen, what's the big deal.

00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:43.020
Like you think Jesus was walking along
San, they're pretty qualified for this.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.280
I'm pretty sure they're gonna do great.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.300
Um, and, and as you, a lot of times know,
is these guys struggle to catch fish?

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.329
If they can't even do very well
with the own job they have,

00:09:51.329 --> 00:09:52.230
how well are they gonna be?

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.459
But Jesus didn't care.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.290
And that's what I love about this picture.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.450
They weren't special.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.280
These fishermen, they weren't qualified.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.360
They weren't scholars.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.390
They were normal everyday people who
here feels like you're just a normal

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.860
everyday person, nothing special.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.510
Maybe you do feel really special.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.520
I feel just pretty normal.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.520
I mean, I don't think I'm just
this great, wonderful person.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.130
That's just, you know, the president
of the United States, like,

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.030
eh, I'm not a big deal, right?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:15.900
That's not me.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.130
So I'm just a normal person.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:17.760
Just like them.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.800
They were in the middle of their day.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.660
Busy doing work.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:23.340
See every day.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.470
I mean, we we've talked about this before.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.250
Are you busy?

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.910
I'm busy.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.080
Anybody busy here?

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.660
I think I need more time to be busier.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.850
So we're busy in the middle of our
day, just like these fishermen were.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.930
And we also see that Jesus
sees us on our condition.

00:10:39.935 --> 00:10:43.020
So these men, you know, again, they could
have been defeated if they weren't getting

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.710
any good fish, but I know this Jesus
season our condition when we're broken.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.540
When we're confident, right?

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.770
When we're busy and confused and
when things are going well, Jesus

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.829
sees us in our good conditions
and in our bad days, right.

00:10:55.835 --> 00:10:57.390
In our good days and our bad days.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.620
And I just started sitting here thinking
this, Jesus sees us all the time.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.939
He's not surprised by our condition,
our thoughts or our actions, or our

00:11:05.939 --> 00:11:10.710
struggles and Jesus still desires
to use us despite those things.

00:11:11.699 --> 00:11:14.010
So then I even started thinking
this, do you ever struggle?

00:11:14.745 --> 00:11:19.275
So, you know, maybe just like me,
that Jesus sees you and desires for

00:11:19.275 --> 00:11:22.095
you to be a part of the mission,
but you ever struggle with feeling

00:11:22.095 --> 00:11:25.575
qualified that you're good enough that
you're ever gonna do anything right.

00:11:25.635 --> 00:11:26.475
That you're ever gonna be.

00:11:26.745 --> 00:11:29.505
You know, this person that God could
really use, you know, that if you're

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.415
ever gonna just become the person
that you know, is the, the great

00:11:32.415 --> 00:11:36.285
scholar, the person that just knows
everything's knowledge about everything.

00:11:36.975 --> 00:11:38.415
Even as a pastor, I struggle with that.

00:11:38.415 --> 00:11:40.845
So maybe, maybe you do Jesus.

00:11:41.385 --> 00:11:43.694
Says that you're enough
to come as you are.

00:11:43.694 --> 00:11:46.454
And I, I wanna remind you of something
if you, that maybe is you wanna

00:11:46.454 --> 00:11:51.045
remind you of this over and over
again, the Bible reminds us that

00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:54.224
we are God's greatest creation.

00:11:55.185 --> 00:12:01.064
If you're God's greatest creation and
God sees you, and he wants you to be

00:12:01.064 --> 00:12:05.055
a part of the mission, any of those
doubts, any of those fears, any of

00:12:05.055 --> 00:12:08.954
those struggles that you have should
be washed away because how God sees me

00:12:08.954 --> 00:12:10.574
is way more important than how I see.

00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:15.270
I need you to hear that again,
the way God sees you is way more

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.709
important than how you see yourself.

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:19.560
I am my own worst critic I am.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.160
And so we need to be reminded of
this, that we are God's greatest

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.020
creation and God sees us as that way.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.469
We are his workmanship created
in Christ Jesus for good works.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.810
We are fearfully and wonderfully made.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.750
God loves his own children, us.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.070
Like we love our own children.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.820
God never requires perfection
from us to be used.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.840
And I love those statements.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.010
And this is why you, how do I get
this out of Jesus saw these fishermen

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.680
because it just reminded me that Jesus
sees us, despite what we bring to the

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.990
table, how confident we feel, what
good we bring, God still sees us.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.130
Jesus still sees us.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.650
So God loves us to spot
any of the downfalls.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:12:58.800
We.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.280
He still desires to accomplish
his purpose through us.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.350
He desires to use all of us.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.580
So Jesus is still walking around,
looking at each one of us today.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.600
So I wanna start there.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:14.820
Jesus is looking today at you and
he's gonna extend the same call

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.040
that he extended these fishermen.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:18.930
And that's what we see
in this next section.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:23.190
So one, God sees you,
number two, God calls us.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.730
So verse 19 part of 19 and 21, it says.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.900
It says, um, I'm gonna
try to find 19 here.

00:13:31.199 --> 00:13:33.150
He basically, Jesus says to follow me.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:37.260
He told them, and then we see
also at the back end of 21, it

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.910
says that Jesus called them.

00:13:39.689 --> 00:13:43.199
So he called them to follow him.

00:13:43.359 --> 00:13:43.709
Jesus.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:49.589
So in this story, it's very clear that
we see Simon and Peter or Simon, Peter

00:13:49.589 --> 00:13:53.459
and Andrew, and their specific call
right come and I'll make you fishers of.

00:13:54.405 --> 00:13:55.875
The next one, we really
didn't kind of see that.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.205
Clearly.

00:13:56.205 --> 00:13:59.295
He just says he called them and
they, they went and we can assume

00:13:59.295 --> 00:14:01.635
the same type of call in this
it's kind of grouped together.

00:14:01.635 --> 00:14:03.675
So we're gonna kind of group it
as that same way as that God has

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.515
called them in this same, same
way, but what was their call?

00:14:07.545 --> 00:14:09.825
Their call was to follow Jesus.

00:14:09.825 --> 00:14:12.135
And so I wanna always love
extending this to you.

00:14:12.975 --> 00:14:14.175
That's a simple term.

00:14:14.655 --> 00:14:18.015
Jesus has called each one of us to follow.

00:14:19.005 --> 00:14:20.265
Based upon your life?

00:14:20.265 --> 00:14:21.045
Examples.

00:14:21.315 --> 00:14:24.405
What does it look like to follow Jesus?

00:14:26.205 --> 00:14:27.555
I'm ex I'm actually asking.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.015
So this is give me an answer.

00:14:30.015 --> 00:14:33.075
What does it look like to follow
Jesus based upon your life?

00:14:40.515 --> 00:14:43.905
To read to know more about him to,
to build a relationship with him.

00:14:43.905 --> 00:14:44.295
Good.

00:14:44.325 --> 00:14:47.055
What else to serve others?

00:14:48.975 --> 00:14:49.814
To tell others.

00:14:49.965 --> 00:14:50.475
Yeah.

00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:51.705
What else?

00:14:54.045 --> 00:14:54.675
Prayer.

00:14:55.035 --> 00:14:55.605
Yes.

00:14:57.465 --> 00:14:58.005
Anything else?

00:14:58.005 --> 00:14:59.715
What does it look like to follow Jesus?

00:14:59.715 --> 00:15:01.395
What does it mean to follow Jesus?

00:15:07.635 --> 00:15:09.045
So those are all great things.

00:15:09.045 --> 00:15:11.175
I just wanted give somebody another
opportunity to share it right.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.100
As we look at what it means
to follow Jesus you're right.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.970
Those things are all of those things
included and there's so many more, right.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.280
We don't even have to compartmentalize
them into even just those

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.900
individual things, but really
following Jesus is an everyday.

00:15:25.845 --> 00:15:26.295
Decision.

00:15:26.295 --> 00:15:30.075
It's an everyday decision to know
more about him and how to follow him.

00:15:30.075 --> 00:15:33.105
And Jesus does a great job all
throughout the new Testament,

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:35.595
um, to tell us how to follow him.

00:15:35.955 --> 00:15:36.945
But I just wanna start with this.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.285
Let's start with the word, uh, follow.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:43.995
What does it mean to follow is
to, to guide or to engage in a

00:15:43.995 --> 00:15:49.995
calling or way of life to follow
is to model or learn after someone?

00:15:50.265 --> 00:15:53.535
I would think of it this way to
follow as like apprenticeship, anybody

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.465
ever been in an apprenticeship.

00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:58.920
I, I mean, I, I, I've seen people
in apprenticeship role, typically,

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.160
Doug, I think people are even
new to your company lately.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.380
And they've been like following you around
and figuring out what you're doing, right.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.920
That basically in apprenticeship
role, all they're doing is they're

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.949
watching and they're learning,
they're asking questions.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.500
And then at some point that
apprenticeship role, there's a point

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.880
where it says, okay, now you try.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.410
And we see this again in the due
Testament where the disciples begin

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.849
to follow Jesus and try on their own.

00:16:20.849 --> 00:16:22.079
And they, they made some mistake.

00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:26.805
But ultimately Jesus was not only
preparing these disciples and they're

00:16:26.805 --> 00:16:30.855
calling for Jesus being there with
him, but for when he would leave.

00:16:31.335 --> 00:16:37.335
And when he left, did the disciples
fulfill their calling perfectly anybody?

00:16:38.355 --> 00:16:40.545
No, they, they didn't,
they made mistakes too.

00:16:40.995 --> 00:16:44.475
So at times we look at this and we say,
okay, God has called us, but man, I'm

00:16:44.475 --> 00:16:48.435
gonna struggle to fulfill it to a perfect,
well, no, he didn't call perfect people.

00:16:49.364 --> 00:16:51.015
We know we'll not follow Jesus.

00:16:51.015 --> 00:16:51.375
Perfect.

00:16:51.375 --> 00:16:53.745
But to follow obviously is
like apprenticeship, right?

00:16:53.745 --> 00:16:57.854
But Jesus called these four men to
follow him and to follow Jesus is more

00:16:57.854 --> 00:17:00.495
than a confession of faith in who he is.

00:17:00.495 --> 00:17:05.264
It's a life we choose to live
that emulates the life of Jesus.

00:17:05.474 --> 00:17:09.315
And this is so important calling us away
from our former life and into a new life.

00:17:09.315 --> 00:17:10.815
When we give our lives to Jesus.

00:17:11.535 --> 00:17:13.455
it means we leave our old life behind.

00:17:13.455 --> 00:17:15.735
And so what I mean by that is it
doesn't mean you quit every job.

00:17:15.735 --> 00:17:19.035
You're a part of, and every group
you're a part of, and you, you go

00:17:19.035 --> 00:17:22.725
just be with Jesus, even though this
is what these guys did to follow

00:17:22.725 --> 00:17:24.975
Jesus is, is a change of mind.

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:26.775
It's a change of life.

00:17:26.775 --> 00:17:30.345
And the fact of the way in what
you're committed to it's that you're

00:17:30.345 --> 00:17:36.015
committed more to God's work than you
are to your own personal gain or work.

00:17:36.075 --> 00:17:38.745
And we see this with these men
whenever they stepped away from.

00:17:39.419 --> 00:17:41.010
Their livelihood of fishing, right.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:41.730
And their family.

00:17:43.439 --> 00:17:46.020
So these disciples who had
chosen to follow Jesus had

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.219
to make that decision, right.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.080
That they were going to follow Jesus.

00:17:49.709 --> 00:17:51.929
And I thought one of the most
interesting things with this, when

00:17:51.929 --> 00:17:55.350
we look at what they left, they left
the only thing that they knew, cuz

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.250
they were fishermen, they left family.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.980
And, and one of the things that
I struggle with the most, they

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.340
left any sort of plan behind them.

00:18:05.699 --> 00:18:07.740
See, I love planning
anybody like planning.

00:18:08.265 --> 00:18:09.435
My wife really loves planning.

00:18:09.435 --> 00:18:12.585
She gets a planner every year and
she writes it all out and see,

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.545
I like planning too, but I've
learned that to follow Jesus.

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:19.425
My plans are, aren't a part of it.

00:18:19.455 --> 00:18:21.885
It's his plans, which means I I've.

00:18:21.885 --> 00:18:25.275
I am telling you, I am not living
the life that I had planned

00:18:25.845 --> 00:18:27.075
before I gave my life to Jesus.

00:18:27.075 --> 00:18:31.395
My life is totally different
and it took a lot of unknowns.

00:18:31.425 --> 00:18:32.595
It took a lot of faith.

00:18:32.835 --> 00:18:34.815
It took a lot of security
that had to let go and.

00:18:36.735 --> 00:18:39.765
and this is the same thing that
we see these disciples doing.

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:42.345
So God called them, right.

00:18:42.645 --> 00:18:44.865
God sees us, God calls us.

00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:46.335
And the cool part with this.

00:18:46.335 --> 00:18:48.405
God, doesn't just call us to a task.

00:18:48.735 --> 00:18:50.415
He equips us for a task.

00:18:50.925 --> 00:18:53.835
So this is the great
thing you may be fearful.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.245
You may have given your life to Jesus.

00:18:55.245 --> 00:18:56.565
And you're like, okay, great.

00:18:57.375 --> 00:18:58.395
I'm a father of Jesus.

00:18:58.395 --> 00:18:59.355
My life is secure.

00:18:59.355 --> 00:19:01.005
I'm going to heaven, praise God.

00:19:01.005 --> 00:19:04.225
And I think we should praise
God forth that in that moment.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.399
We realized now that we have
given our lives to Jesus.

00:19:08.399 --> 00:19:10.139
Now God has called us to a task.

00:19:10.139 --> 00:19:10.950
What's that?

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.560
To discover our purpose in life?

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.440
Well, what was these men's purpose?

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.510
It says, he says, follow me.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:22.169
He told them, and I will
make you fishers of people.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:29.850
God will make you, he will equip you
into becoming what God has called you to.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.070
To do what to follow him, to
follow after him, to follow in his

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:39.870
footsteps, to live the life that
he now lives in you on this earth.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:44.310
I think one of the coolest
parts is Jesus could have chose.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:48.705
Now you may say, ah, He had to
die and, and, and, you know,

00:19:48.705 --> 00:19:49.485
he had to go back to heaven.

00:19:49.485 --> 00:19:52.995
Well, he could have chose to die, be
resurrected and just stay with us.

00:19:53.054 --> 00:19:55.215
But then we would all just
fall this crowd of Jesus and

00:19:55.219 --> 00:19:56.145
there wouldn't be enough room.

00:19:56.294 --> 00:20:01.425
Jesus said the greatest thing that I could
do was actually leave this earth and leave

00:20:01.429 --> 00:20:03.094
the holy spirit inside of each one of us.

00:20:03.794 --> 00:20:07.935
So picture this, and this is guys, I
want us to get this to follow Jesus.

00:20:08.084 --> 00:20:11.415
When you accept Christ Jesus
now lives inside of you.

00:20:12.645 --> 00:20:16.725
And now if we think is the way I'm
living, the way that Jesus would

00:20:16.725 --> 00:20:23.085
live, if he was on earth today, that's
a tough question because if Jesus

00:20:23.085 --> 00:20:28.845
truly lives inside of us, we would be
living the way of Jesus, because we

00:20:28.845 --> 00:20:30.795
are now his fleshly example on earth.

00:20:31.545 --> 00:20:36.465
And I'll even say that challenges the
heck outta me, because Jesus was perfect.

00:20:36.465 --> 00:20:36.705
Right.

00:20:36.705 --> 00:20:39.945
So what I would say though,
is don't let that burden.

00:20:41.325 --> 00:20:44.325
because it's not up to
you to fulfill the call.

00:20:44.325 --> 00:20:45.105
That God's gift you.

00:20:45.555 --> 00:20:46.035
Why?

00:20:46.125 --> 00:20:48.825
Because he says, I will
make you into fishers.

00:20:49.005 --> 00:20:50.205
I will equip you.

00:20:50.925 --> 00:20:54.435
So Jesus desires for us to
be fishers of men and women.

00:20:54.435 --> 00:20:54.795
Right?

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:56.295
What does this truly mean?

00:20:57.225 --> 00:21:01.335
Once we realize, and this is so
important guys, once we realize what

00:21:01.335 --> 00:21:05.145
we have in a relationship with Jesus,
Through a relationship with Jesus,

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:09.105
we can't help, but invite others to
experience that relationship with Jesus.

00:21:09.314 --> 00:21:13.935
If you've truly been changed by Jesus,
it has changed you enough, that there

00:21:13.935 --> 00:21:16.875
are people around you that need to hear
that same thing that need to experience

00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:18.585
the, the serving that Jesus did.

00:21:18.585 --> 00:21:23.064
The compassion that Jesus gave
the love guys, that's difficult.

00:21:23.235 --> 00:21:24.254
I'm just telling you truth.

00:21:24.254 --> 00:21:24.735
Be told.

00:21:24.735 --> 00:21:28.754
I struggle to be like Jesus, and I'm
still seeking to learn more and more

00:21:28.905 --> 00:21:30.615
and try to surrender to that as.

00:21:31.754 --> 00:21:34.695
but if God has so changed my life and
he's been willing to do that for me,

00:21:34.784 --> 00:21:36.885
isn't that enough for others around me.

00:21:37.004 --> 00:21:40.665
So I know this is gonna land horrible
because all of my great examples,

00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:44.294
land horrible, but you will relate
if you've been around Hamilton guys.

00:21:44.294 --> 00:21:48.264
Now that I've experienced
flubs, I send everybody there.

00:21:49.155 --> 00:21:51.945
Every mission Dean that comes
in, they go there six times.

00:21:52.455 --> 00:21:56.985
Why that this great ice cream
and I don't hesitate to share it.

00:21:57.044 --> 00:22:00.075
And I think my sister and
brother-in-law went there three times.

00:22:00.389 --> 00:22:00.570
Right.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:01.439
And they've been here four days.

00:22:01.439 --> 00:22:03.240
I mean, like, they love it.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:04.620
Why did I tell them?

00:22:04.679 --> 00:22:06.419
Because ice cream changed my life.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:12.030
I mean, that sounds stupid, but it
was simple because I enjoy ice cream.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:13.889
Why isn't Jesus?

00:22:13.889 --> 00:22:14.730
That same way.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:16.560
Jesus has changed my life.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.929
Way more than ice cream,
way more than ice cream.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:25.980
But at times I struggle to follow
Jesus the way that Jesus has

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.270
called and equipped me to why.

00:22:29.535 --> 00:22:34.035
Why typically it's because
in the following of Jesus,

00:22:35.985 --> 00:22:38.625
we forget what Jesus modeled.

00:22:39.615 --> 00:22:43.455
We begin to get distracted
from what Jesus modeled.

00:22:43.635 --> 00:22:47.115
We begin to let our selfish
desires get in front of what Jesus.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.460
Had called us to do, and we go back
to, when we try to go to what, what I

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.880
would say is the minimum requirement,
anybody ever done something like

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.510
we're at the end of a school year, all
you had to make was a 56 on a final.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.580
And you're like, I'm not
gonna study for this thing.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.600
It's gonna be easy.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.130
You do the minimum requirement.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.480
I think as followers of Jesus, when we've
given our life to Jesus and we know our

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.290
eternity secured, we're like, what's the
minimum we get by to make sure that we

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.940
still look like we're followers of Jesus.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.140
Is that not true?

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.360
I mean, I am I hanging out here alone?

00:23:16.754 --> 00:23:21.885
I don't think I am, but if I am Lord,
forgive me, I may be the only one, but

00:23:21.885 --> 00:23:23.745
at times we like the minimum requirement.

00:23:24.495 --> 00:23:25.814
What does it mean to follow Jesus?

00:23:25.814 --> 00:23:27.044
Well, I gave my life to him.

00:23:27.925 --> 00:23:29.354
I, I confessed my sins once.

00:23:29.655 --> 00:23:32.774
I would say this following
Jesus, and this is so important.

00:23:32.774 --> 00:23:35.175
And, and we learned this from the
missions pastor a couple weeks ago

00:23:35.179 --> 00:23:42.794
when he preached Luke 9 23 says to pick
up our cross daily and follow Jesus.

00:23:44.085 --> 00:23:48.945
That means we are constantly,
constantly choosing every day to

00:23:48.945 --> 00:23:52.155
follow him, choosing to look at his
footsteps and say, you know what?

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.725
Sometimes those are, those are
difficult, but God says he will make

00:23:55.725 --> 00:23:58.965
me into what he has called me to do.

00:23:59.565 --> 00:24:02.565
And again, the biggest picture here
is that God has called them to Fisher.

00:24:02.565 --> 00:24:05.475
This man, everything which
we do is, is a light.

00:24:05.475 --> 00:24:07.455
So you may be this well,
I'm not an evangelist.

00:24:07.665 --> 00:24:09.075
These guys weren't, they were fishermen.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:13.440
They were fishermen, their
lives, emulated Christ.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.660
And that is what would draw people.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:20.880
They obviously told people about
Jesus as well, but when he talks

00:24:20.885 --> 00:24:24.480
about God will make us, how will
God make us into these Fisher's men?

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.800
Or how will God make us
into a life after Jesus?

00:24:29.639 --> 00:24:31.800
Well, we have to look at
Jesus' example, right?

00:24:31.889 --> 00:24:35.460
We talked about spending time with
Jesus, but who was Jesus Jesus'

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.110
example was he healed people.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.040
He forgave people.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:38.909
He served people.

00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:40.560
He loved, he had compassion.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.379
He gave everything to fulfill his mission.

00:24:43.385 --> 00:24:45.780
He consistently had a
relationship with his father.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.300
And guess if that that's not the
greatest picture to look at, if

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:53.610
Jesus needed time alone with his
own father and him being Jesus.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:58.980
Don't we need that same time in order
to, to be reminded of who Jesus is.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:03.000
I know this, I faced so many
obstacles in my own life.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.630
And when I started thinking back this
week and I started thinking if I did

00:25:06.635 --> 00:25:12.690
not have Jesus who worked in me and
threw me because he's the one that

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:15.030
equipped me, I would've failed miserably.

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:20.130
But the only reason why I stand here
today, sometimes I feel like limping,

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.600
but I'm here today is because Jesus made.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.800
Because Jesus equipped me for the work.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.389
Not because I'm special.

00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:30.720
I didn't bring anything but
trust and faith in the Lord

00:25:30.899 --> 00:25:32.760
and following him every day.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:37.260
And that's what he was telling
these fishermen, come follow me.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:42.060
And I will give you a new purpose to
help change the lives of so many people.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.460
All you have to bring is faith.

00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:49.710
So God is inviting every single
one of us into this, not just into

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.090
giving our lives to Christ through.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.590
One time decision, but a
daily walk with the Lord.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.620
So God sees us, God
calls us God equips us.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.730
And I love this last part.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.120
You may not see this, but I saw this
and maybe it was just my own story.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.820
I believe ultimately God inspires us.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:06.690
Right?

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:11.010
Let's look at verses 20 and 22
after Jesus makes this call to

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.960
follow him, to make fishers of men.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.910
This is what both of the men do.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:17.700
It says immediately they left
their nets and followed him.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.090
And then we see in verse 22
immediately, they left their boat and

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.220
their father and they followed him.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.860
I just, I would, I would
just tell you this.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.270
If somebody gave me a free vacation,
it's not hard for me to be convinced

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:41.520
to go, but when somebody calls me to
follow after Jesus, What is it that

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.270
that gives me like, oh man, I really
wanna fall after Jesus and change lives.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.260
And what is it?

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:52.380
It's the inspiring idea that God
has done so much for me and you, God

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.300
has done so much to give us life.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.910
Do you, I mean, forget
salvation right now.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.110
And I know you're gonna
say I'm crazy here.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.980
Forget salvation.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.280
If you haven't given your life to Jesus
and you have breath in your lungs,

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.720
do you know that God gave you that?

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.110
He even gave you like salvation.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.600
If you haven't given your life
to Christ, he gave you that.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.850
So if you can't even take
salvation and you're just saying,

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:12.840
God, didn't gimme anything.

00:27:12.845 --> 00:27:14.040
God gave you life.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.160
Like God's done so much for us.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.280
And then he's gonna come
and say, Hey, you know what?

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:21.840
I gave you life.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.280
And the relationship that we had
at one time is broken, but I'm not

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.450
gonna leaving you in that condition.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.040
I'm gonna send Jesus to save.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.150
And to follow after and to help
you become the person that God has

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.220
called you to be, that is, oh man.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.740
Like what God has done for me inspires me.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.610
And this is why I use that word inspires
because if God doesn't inspire us, which

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.000
means he doesn't come and live inside
of us, if he doesn't change us, we will

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.910
never, we will never inspire someone else.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:48.930
Never.

00:27:49.905 --> 00:27:52.125
We'll never inspire someone
else to follow Jesus if we

00:27:52.125 --> 00:27:53.175
haven't been inspired ourselves.

00:27:53.385 --> 00:27:56.505
So we see that they were willing
to give up everything because

00:27:56.505 --> 00:27:59.805
they were so inspired by, by
the story of, of Jesus's call.

00:27:59.805 --> 00:28:01.005
And you may say, well,
they don't know much.

00:28:01.005 --> 00:28:02.235
He doesn't know much about Jesus.

00:28:02.445 --> 00:28:04.875
These guys at some point had
to have heard about Jesus.

00:28:05.355 --> 00:28:08.235
We don't fully know all the whole story,
but they had is at some point know about.

00:28:10.125 --> 00:28:12.105
So that was challenging.

00:28:12.585 --> 00:28:15.255
So again, the word inspires
to draw out of someone.

00:28:15.435 --> 00:28:16.725
What is deep down inside.

00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:23.745
I believe every day we are trying to
shine the light of Jesus to people

00:28:23.745 --> 00:28:28.665
around us so that they will see that they
have something missing in their life.

00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:31.815
They will see that deep down inside
God desires a relationship with them.

00:28:32.715 --> 00:28:36.645
And so as we follow Jesus, we see
everything he went through to give us the

00:28:36.645 --> 00:28:39.555
hope and we respond by being inspired.

00:28:39.555 --> 00:28:43.335
An example, these
fishermen left everything.

00:28:43.815 --> 00:28:45.255
So here's a couple of takeaways.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.740
I, I kind of mentioned earlier, but
I think it's worth mentioning before

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.639
we, we, we finish up today after
they immediately left, I started

00:28:53.645 --> 00:28:57.600
thinking, but why didn't they ask
Jesus this, Hey Jesus, what's the plan.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.820
Can you give me the calendar of the dates
that you know, I'm gonna be out of town

00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:07.470
so I can tell my wife or my dad so that
they can get us up for my fishing team.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:07.980
Nope.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.879
We don't see that in here.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.830
He didn't say they didn't say, Hey,
is my, my health gonna be okay.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.879
And how are we gonna pay for this a.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.940
And am I gonna be okay?

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.620
They didn't ask that question either,
but he did promise to give them

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.850
everything they needed to be successful
in their calls as fishermen of men.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.290
And you maybe see everything.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:28.860
Yeah.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.280
Because Jesus says, I
will make you into this.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:34.530
They took Jesus at his word.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.150
And I think it's time for all
of us to think through that.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.800
Are we willing to take Jesus at his.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:46.530
Because if we're in his word,
his word consistently says that

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:49.290
he has given us everything.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:53.220
We need to fulfill the call in our
life to be forgiven of our sins,

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:58.200
to help other people discover hope
in Jesus, to go and live inspired,

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.840
to go be the light of Christ.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.399
He has given us everything.

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:07.320
And if we'll wake up every day and claim
that truth, we will be just like these.

00:30:08.625 --> 00:30:09.555
We'll leave our jobs.

00:30:09.555 --> 00:30:14.295
At times, we'll leave comfort, we'll
leave health, we'll leave family.

00:30:14.295 --> 00:30:19.125
We'll do whatever it takes so that
somebody else can experience who Jesus is.

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:25.395
I've seen way too many lives change
in this church to be looking at

00:30:25.395 --> 00:30:26.264
this and going, you know what?

00:30:26.264 --> 00:30:26.895
It's not worth it.

00:30:28.754 --> 00:30:33.345
And, and I would just say
this to experience life change

00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:37.155
because of following Jesus
will help spur you on to keep.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.760
God has called us to keep going.

00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:44.669
I started thinking about this and I'm
gonna, I'm gonna kind of finish before I

00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:48.480
go into conclusion, but I wanna, I wanna
mention this, my story, my call, I gave

00:30:48.485 --> 00:30:51.270
my life to Christ back in like 2012.

00:30:51.629 --> 00:30:54.510
And for two years I just was falling
Jesus, learning more about it.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:58.290
I've been getting more involved in church
and there came this point where I sense

00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:59.909
that God was calling me to something more.

00:30:59.909 --> 00:31:02.220
Now, again, this is something more
where I felt like it was full-time

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.110
ministry, but I had no clue what it was.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.310
You know what I kept asking God, this.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.970
God, if you'll give me the plan,
like if you'll lay out the plan,

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:11.790
I'll say yes, I'll say yes.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.670
And you know what Jesus kept saying
back to me as I read his word,

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.820
if you show me your faith, I'll
show you the way I, I look at this

00:31:17.825 --> 00:31:19.740
text and I see that call again.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:26.700
Jesus was saying, just, just say yes, and
I will make you in into what you call me.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:30.930
I remember the day I'm sitting in
this pew at the end of a revival and

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.270
I'm like, okay, God, I trust you.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:38.040
Guys, I just started thinking,
you know, do you realize that I

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.490
could have said no, I could have
said I'm gonna wait for the plan.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:48.180
I had no clue what would come,
but for somehow some stinking way,

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.190
I'm planning a church in Ohio.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:53.790
I don't know how that would've
happened without a step of faith.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.860
And I'll just tell you this.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.590
When I stepped out there and told
people that I was running into

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.390
ministry, that was the first.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:06.840
Many steps of faith for me personally,
in my call of following Jesus, because

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.080
there was a lot more that I had to say
yes to Jesus, that was sacrificial.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.910
That was difficult.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:16.710
And, and what I am not saying, and what
I'm not saying about these guys is that

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:18.690
every one of us is called to my calling.

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:23.370
What I am saying that every one of us
is called to be fishers of men, where

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.790
you are and where God is calling you.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:29.130
What's stopping us.

00:32:30.419 --> 00:32:33.149
Is it, is it the area where I was
struggling, where we want all the

00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:38.820
plans figured out, or are we gonna
trust God and take his word that he

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.470
will make us into what we need to be?

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:45.720
And if he's going to make us, and if
we're going to follow following takes

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:50.909
consistency every day, pursuing him in
his word every day, asking the question,

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:55.440
God, who is it in my life that you placed
in my life today that I can change.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:57.540
I know this.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:01.230
That as a church God's
not done with us yet.

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:06.390
He's ready for each one of us to
take a next step in our faith.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:12.060
So this story of the first disciples
fallen, Jesus really reminds us why

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:17.700
Jesus has called us to fulfill the
mission that he started so long ago.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:24.420
This story reminds us of all the things
that God did for us to not just leave

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.420
us where we are, but to send us out.

00:33:28.274 --> 00:33:32.475
Into our homes into our
community, into our neighborhoods.

00:33:32.534 --> 00:33:37.305
You name it to go fulfill the mission,
to inspire hope, to help other people

00:33:37.305 --> 00:33:42.855
discover relationship with Jesus so
that people can repent their sins.

00:33:43.365 --> 00:33:45.794
They can surrender their
lives and experience what

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.385
God has given each one of us.

00:33:48.284 --> 00:33:51.225
And my hope is that as they do
that, and as you give your life

00:33:51.225 --> 00:33:55.065
to Jesus that we'll see more and
more people fulfill their purpose.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.790
I, I, I I'm telling you, like, God is
just reminding me over and over again.

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:04.290
The future of God's kingdom to be
expanded in Hamilton and around the world

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:05.940
starts with each one of us in this room.

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:08.010
Each one of us.

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.170
I, I, what if I die tomorrow?

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.210
What if somebody else dies tomorrow?

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.550
What if, what if this
facility isn't here tomorrow?

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.470
Does the mission still go on?

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:21.930
It does how Jesus doesn't reside.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:23.850
He didn't say he resides here.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.510
He says he resides there
in you in the seats.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.030
The mission will be accomplished.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:35.880
If each one of us allows the
Jesus that lives inside of us,

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:41.700
go fulfill the mission by making
us into fishers of men and women.

00:34:42.390 --> 00:34:46.650
I know this go to the fishing
analogy, the more poles that are put

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:47.970
in the water I've I've been fishing.

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:49.020
We put three in a lot.

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:49.680
Why?

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:51.390
Because you wanna put
different bait on there.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:56.880
Number one, number two, you're thinking
three poles, more likely to catch a fish.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.580
How many of us are putting
our poles out there?

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:01.620
And we're fishing for people.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:06.930
God's inviting us to join these men
and inviting us to enjoy them and,

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:10.680
and, and join the mission that God's
called each one of us to fulfill today.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.770
So where do we go from here?

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:15.750
What does it look like as
we, we finish up today?

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.050
How do each one of us take a
next step in our faith truth?

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:19.620
Be told.

00:35:20.279 --> 00:35:22.379
I can't make that step for you.

00:35:22.529 --> 00:35:27.569
And I can give you some examples, but
for some of you today, today is the

00:35:27.569 --> 00:35:29.700
day where you stop putting it off.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.299
You stop saying, I'm gonna give
my life to Christ down the road.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:36.870
I stop you stop saying that you're
gonna not do whatever it is.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:40.740
Put it on the list, whatever step
of faith that you aren't taking

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.839
today is the day to take it.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.299
There's no better day
to take it than today.

00:35:45.299 --> 00:35:46.109
You wanna know why.

00:35:46.785 --> 00:35:51.135
It's this challenge that God has
placed from the moment that you leave

00:35:51.135 --> 00:35:56.625
here until the next time I see you a
plan in place to fulfill the mission.

00:35:57.345 --> 00:36:00.495
And by you taking that next step,
you can help fulfill the mission.

00:36:00.915 --> 00:36:01.725
But what if you don't?

00:36:02.865 --> 00:36:06.315
What if just like 10 or so years ago?

00:36:06.915 --> 00:36:08.085
What if I didn't get outta the chair?

00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:09.675
I wonder that all the time.

00:36:10.725 --> 00:36:13.425
What if you don't get outta the chair and
take the next step that God's calling you?

00:36:15.045 --> 00:36:18.585
Whose life will not be impacted
maybe your own to start with,

00:36:19.395 --> 00:36:20.865
but maybe it's your neighbors.

00:36:20.865 --> 00:36:22.095
Maybe it's your families.

00:36:23.115 --> 00:36:24.885
I don't know, but I'll just challenge you.

00:36:24.885 --> 00:36:26.535
This don't miss it.

00:36:26.835 --> 00:36:27.405
Don't miss it.

00:36:34.515 --> 00:36:37.365
So I'm gonna pray for us and we're
gonna have a time of invitation.

00:36:38.475 --> 00:36:39.615
And so we have a time of invitation.

00:36:39.615 --> 00:36:41.465
My challenge is for you
to give that to the Lord.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.750
To ask the Lord this question, what is
it that I need to take a next step in?

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:52.770
If again, if it is to give your
life to Christ, how do you give

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:57.180
your life to Christ by repenting
of your sins, asking God to come

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.220
into your life and help change you?

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:01.049
That is scary.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.379
Can I just say that that's scary sometimes
to just be public about your faith?

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.669
I get it.

00:37:05.669 --> 00:37:08.790
I remember when I gave my life to
Christ, I was afraid to tell my family.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.049
It just was.

00:37:12.015 --> 00:37:12.765
but you don't have to be.

00:37:13.275 --> 00:37:16.395
So today, maybe you need to give
your life to Christ and I encourage

00:37:16.395 --> 00:37:17.835
you if you do, I'll be in the back.

00:37:18.075 --> 00:37:20.174
If it's not during
invitation, it's right after.

00:37:20.174 --> 00:37:23.865
I want to talk to you at the next steps
table, but whatever you do, please, during

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:29.055
this time invitation, ask the Lord what
it is the next step in following Jesus.

00:37:29.085 --> 00:37:30.165
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:37:30.165 --> 00:37:35.625
We, uh, Lord just asked that you
open our hearts and minds Lord to

00:37:36.285 --> 00:37:38.235
what you've taught us in this text.

00:37:38.235 --> 00:37:38.475
Lord.

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:45.390
As I just am reminded Lord that you see
us right now in the condition we are

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:49.050
right now, Lord, there may even be people
in this room, Lord, because I get it.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:54.120
There's people in this room that when
they're trying to think of the next

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.500
step, they may be thinking, I don't know.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:00.450
So Lord, I pray that
you reveal that to them.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:01.620
Lord, what that next step is.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.150
Again, maybe it's given their life to you.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:04.830
Maybe it's baptism.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.930
Maybe it's becoming a
member of inspiring hope.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:07.340
Maybe it.

00:38:07.845 --> 00:38:12.194
Serve in their community more, maybe
it's to go tell a family member about who

00:38:12.194 --> 00:38:17.685
Jesus is, maybe it's to, to pray and to
trust the Lord that prayer changes lives.

00:38:21.134 --> 00:38:27.884
But Lord, I know you have not created
us and saved us to just stay where we

00:38:27.884 --> 00:38:35.865
are and to not be a part of fulfilling
the mission that you gave your life to.

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:45.450
God help us as a church prioritize
following you, Lord, I don't wanna

00:38:45.455 --> 00:38:48.210
be a church that does so many things.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.360
Oh, and on the second side,
Lord, there's on the other.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.920
Oh, we do follow Jesus too.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.130
Lord.

00:38:53.134 --> 00:38:57.480
I want us to be a church that follows you
completely in every single thing we do.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:02.850
So Lord help us, help me as a
pastor, help me as a Christian.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:03.990
Help me as a father.

00:39:06.225 --> 00:39:11.115
Follow you better so that I can
be the lie to those around me.

00:39:11.504 --> 00:39:13.484
May I lead by example for this church?

00:39:16.154 --> 00:39:20.084
Gotta help us because we have
nowhere else to go for help.

00:39:22.214 --> 00:39:23.564
So Lord, we just pray
this in your family name.

00:39:24.404 --> 00:39:24.705
Amen.
