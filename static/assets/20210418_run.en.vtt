00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.080
want to imitate god and safety&nbsp;
is this we need to follow you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.120
um and when it comes to following following it's&nbsp;
not something that you do occasionally right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.360
to really grasp the guidance and move that&nbsp;
consistently in order to imitate we use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.240
example of cody imitating uh michael jordan right&nbsp;
that didn't happen overnight it was consistent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.320
uh consistently so we learned that from last&nbsp;
week and i was just i'm just reminded by this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.040
luke 9 23 says if anyone wants to follow after&nbsp;
me this is jesus speaking let him deny himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.560
take up his cross barely and follow me um it's&nbsp;
just again a reminder that it's it's a daily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.120
sacrifice to follow it's not an occasional and so&nbsp;
i again just i just want to ask this question just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.040
kind of as we get going how many go on here by&nbsp;
raising hands one to imitating jesus in your life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.720
okay sounds like we got the majority&nbsp;
of jason doesn't want to imitate jesus

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.360
um so again it's just setting this ton of this&nbsp;
idea of everybody in here is raising their hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.760
they want to annotate jesus we really want to&nbsp;
follow jesus but we're getting ready to jump&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.280
off into some interesting topic right topics and&nbsp;
this is the part where we can kind of get a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.720
uncomfortable um it's okay can we hardly&nbsp;
get through this but this is going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.600
something where i'm going to challenge you to&nbsp;
stay focused um as we really walk through this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.440
internalize this for the value of yourself&nbsp;
and those maybe you're walking alongside of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.480
um as they're going to their faith um but just&nbsp;
again in these two verses we realize that paul's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.480
telling us to focus on jesus and when we're&nbsp;
focusing on jesus we're less distracted by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.520
other things right around us and that's exactly&nbsp;
what i believe paul started off this way imitate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.200
jesus follow him in love right um before we talk&nbsp;
about these things so let's read this text here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.960
again ephesians chapter five verses three&nbsp;
through seven i'm just gonna start with verse one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.720
just to kind of set up where we're kind of&nbsp;
continuing from last week so he says therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.080
be imitators of god as dearly loved&nbsp;
children and walk in love as christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.960
also loved us and gave himself for us a&nbsp;
sacrificial and fragrant offering to god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.560
but sexual immorality and impurity or greed should&nbsp;
not even be heard among you as is proper for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.200
the saints obscene and foolish talking or cruel&nbsp;
joking are not suitable but rather giving thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.560
for know and recognize this every sexual immoral&nbsp;
or impure or greedy person who is an idolater&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.040
does not have any inheritance in the kingdom&nbsp;
of christ and of god let no one deceive you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.040
with empty arguments for god's wrath is coming on&nbsp;
the disobedient because of these things therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.000
do not become their partners so let's pray just&nbsp;
invite god into opening our hearts to this text&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.240
lord jesus um we're so thankful again for you and&nbsp;
your presence in this place because we're two or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.560
three gathering your name lord you are amongst&nbsp;
us and so we're thank you for that thank you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.080
for this word uh that you've given us to really&nbsp;
look at in light of everything you've done for us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.760
and lord let us leave here walking uh in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.720
light that you called us to walk and um&nbsp;
we just pray this in your heavenly name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.680
amen amen so we see here um that paul is now&nbsp;
transitioning he's basically going to discuss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.000
the purity of our walk when it comes to imitating&nbsp;
jesus and uh again you may look at this this first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.080
verse here and think okay this doesn't apply to me&nbsp;
you know let's let's move on but let's let's look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.680
at the depth of really what he's saying but sexual&nbsp;
immorality so what is sexual immorality it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.680
really any sexual activity outside the biblical&nbsp;
marriage um and so just to go a step further&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.400
you know most of you probably think in your mind&nbsp;
what exactly is that um that would be this right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.800
premarital sex same sex relation adultery viewing&nbsp;
or watching pornography and then he goes in and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.240
says any impurity so just in case maybe you said&nbsp;
hey you didn't mention one thing that maybe it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.360
okay to do he says in any impurity and so it's&nbsp;
really just that idea of any lust or pure moves um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.440
so this basically covers any of our excuses from&nbsp;
one of these away and then he talks about green&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.160
any greedy desire to have more covetousness um and&nbsp;
so he's basically saying this all of these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.600
are sin and i remember this idea against sin is&nbsp;
it's not that okay we're bad people because we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.240
do these things we think these things we say these&nbsp;
things but it's this idea that it's not valuable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.480
for you it's not beneficial for you that's&nbsp;
really where pulse can you imitate jesus that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.240
beneficial it's life-giving these things are not&nbsp;
life-giving right they're actually struggling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.240
they cause a struggle in your life and i remember&nbsp;
hearing this statement and i had to go flying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.280
figure out exactly what it was but it said but it&nbsp;
said sin will take you farther than you want to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.840
keep you longer than you want to stay&nbsp;
and cost you more than you want to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.840
and so he's very specific none of you should be&nbsp;
named or heard among you so who is paul directly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.680
speaking to i'm actually saying he's called&nbsp;
directly speaking these things should not be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:14.240
named among christians the saints right those who&nbsp;
would say i want to answer christ so based upon he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.240
raised my hand earlier you just said hey i don't&nbsp;
want to walk in this so that's a good thing right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.240
that's what he's saying he says anyone should&nbsp;
not be named among you and this is the part where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.320
okay great again let's move on we know what&nbsp;
we're talking about there's this is great okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.920
we want to talk anymore but paul specifically&nbsp;
is talking to believers in the church and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.960
just from my little bit of research&nbsp;
and what you may already understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.480
without me saying this is do you think that that&nbsp;
same problem is still in the church some of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:51.840
things these mentions yeah it is and if you really&nbsp;
begin to do a lot of studying you'll find that um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.480
some of the the major reasons for uh or well&nbsp;
leaders come back let's go back a little further&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.600
the divorce rate in the church and outside the&nbsp;
church is about the same and most of them come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.240
from these types of things we're just talking&nbsp;
about um you'll also find that i think it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.600
somewhere out there that says somewhere between&nbsp;
60 to 70 of people within the church actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.080
view or visit pornography so it's actually&nbsp;
an issue within the church and when i began&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.200
to even think a little bit further on this and&nbsp;
thinking okay if paul's speaking to the church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.120
and he's talking about you know and i brought&nbsp;
him that whole idea of so divorce it's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.400
same in the church as it's outside of the church&nbsp;
what that's my thing what's the major causes of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.640
divorce within the church so i'll give you&nbsp;
three top reasons um number one adultery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.880
um within the church we're within people who&nbsp;
are believers it's adultery so that fits in with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:58.320
sexual morality number two drugs are alcoholics&nbsp;
so indian period um financial problems create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.240
disagreements so you think about what's paul&nbsp;
speaking to here he's speaking to things that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.640
are not valuable for you to destroy relationships&nbsp;
to destroy the things that god has designed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.800
to be pure um we see effect obviously when we're&nbsp;
in pure thoughts or this sexual immorality and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.560
um most of us would say okay again here's&nbsp;
the first three things we're just gonna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.200
continue to talk we don't have issues with&nbsp;
that maybe in my marriage or if i'm single

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.200
in our marriages or even as a single&nbsp;
person um we're already losing god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.320
uh in this and so we can't win the war by sitting&nbsp;
still we have to attack we have to be prepared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.880
for this and we're going to continue to talk on&nbsp;
this that today would be easy for you to sit here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.800
and listen to these things and maybe you struggle&nbsp;
with someone or maybe you don't and you're sitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.080
here it's okay what's the value we're going to&nbsp;
talk about some practical steps to overcome some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.560
of this um but here here let me let me kind of&nbsp;
give you this before we go on the next section&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:12.000
the things we talked about sexual immorality any&nbsp;
impurity or greed do you know that within the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.720
pure forms of those god has given us those things&nbsp;
to enjoy so let me tell you that what god has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:23.120
given us in a right relationship with these things&nbsp;
um and so from a sexual relationship within the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:29.360
marriage was designed for good was designed for&nbsp;
enjoyment was designed for exactly what so sexual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.880
purity within the marriage god gave us right he&nbsp;
didn't give a sexual immorality but he gave us the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.160
appearance of it right so purity in itself rather&nbsp;
than imperial purity itself is really innocence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:47.600
or freedom from uh condemnation when i think&nbsp;
about that is whenever we're in beard whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.120
again i think it was as a kid whenever i sinned&nbsp;
whenever there were some things that was impaired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.240
i felt guilty so purity is the guiltless feeling&nbsp;
right that we are appeared before god and the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.800
one was contentment or generosity right realizing&nbsp;
we have an obscene we have more than we need and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:11.120
giving it away and so all of those things are the&nbsp;
positive sides the good sides the things that god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:17.200
has given us as children of god to live in to walk&nbsp;
in and to enjoy but he mentioned the things that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.960
weren't right so this is what god gives us but&nbsp;
paul doesn't just stop and talk about the purity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.360
of her walks he wants to get down to the people&nbsp;
that we're talking so how many of y'all know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.080
um that what comes out of our mouth&nbsp;
starts with what's in our hearts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:40.880
anybody i mean you don't just say things randomly&nbsp;
it comes from some deep-seated heart thought or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.920
that you rely on your life so paul's&nbsp;
mourning against the sins of the tongue which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.320
again we understand that but really verses three&nbsp;
and four they connect together if we're doing one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.000
the other one's probably present and if we're so&nbsp;
to think about it if you're sexually moral you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.840
probably talking about sexually moral things and&nbsp;
and we'll just kind of walk through what this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.600
so he says here in verse four he says obscene&nbsp;
and foolish talking or cruel joking are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.960
suitable but rather give them thanks so we're&nbsp;
gonna talk about that because it's interesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.320
when i read those three things and he says rather&nbsp;
give him things i'm like how does that fit but so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.560
what is obscene talking again this would really be&nbsp;
attributed to talking about sexual internal things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.000
um he talks about foolish talking and this&nbsp;
was translated i love this stupid speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.320
and there's been some times i probably stupidly&nbsp;
spoke for sure stupidly radically weird garrison&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.640
uh but but basically that's speaking without&nbsp;
self-control trash talking or speaking right so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.040
these things aren't beneficial for gears that&nbsp;
we're speaking with and the last one is this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:52.000
crude joking that says vulgar or loot or foul&nbsp;
mouth and when i think about crew joking god's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.840
saying you can't have a hammer in your life right&nbsp;
because we all like joking and having fun this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:03.440
is idea of um nothing that is rude dirty or mean&nbsp;
spirited um and so he says but rather give thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:10.720
and so when you think of a believer and we're&nbsp;
really coming out of verses one and two we want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.840
imitate god remember christ and so everything that&nbsp;
paul just mentioned i think all of us would say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:23.200
those probably were not in the mouth of jesus nor&nbsp;
the thoughts of jesus right those weren't even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.840
named among them so it makes sense why paul is&nbsp;
putting in these hours these should not be a part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.960
of our life and he says that we should give thanks&nbsp;
to god we should be anything that comes out of our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.560
mouth should be giving god glory is really what&nbsp;
i'm saying anything that we say should be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.240
to be an offering back to god and these things&nbsp;
are not an offering to god they're really really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:51.680
obviously so the question is why is that not&nbsp;
valuable right because the way that we talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:59.920
again it's a hard issue it can lead us astray but&nbsp;
here here's the bigger issue to this is we now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.680
are lights the world and at the point&nbsp;
that we are alive to the world anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.720
that comes up our mouth i i think about my&nbsp;
kids there's sometimes just so you guys know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.920
dads make mistakes there's times times i use&nbsp;
the word stupid around my kids that's stupid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.880
and there's probably some of the words i use&nbsp;
and you know what my kids started yelling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.880
that's stupid and then you&nbsp;
know what immediately my heart

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.920
and so what we think about as as mature christians&nbsp;
because this is really what what paul's talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.880
about as we grow in our faith as we make sure up&nbsp;
other christians are watching you especially if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:49.520
they look up to you if you allow it are they gonna&nbsp;
allow yeah well if so and so the pastor says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.760
my friend says that that goes to church who&nbsp;
loves jesus that means i can say that or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.560
they act that way they think it's okay i'll&nbsp;
do that and so when you think oh no they read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.480
their bible they should know that that's&nbsp;
not true that was just a moment of sin no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.240
really people are watching us and&nbsp;
so that should cause us to go okay

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.320
and so again it's not valuable so this is that&nbsp;
that whole everybody remember the whole bracelet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:20.400
face t-shirt face wwjd every day we should walk&nbsp;
around what would jesus do what would jesus say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:29.040
and it's that idea of you know everything that we&nbsp;
do or we say it is a lie to those around us and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:35.920
um when we when we think about where we're getting&nbsp;
ready to head as well it really starts getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:42.560
this point where um you could really feel the&nbsp;
weight of sin maybe in your life maybe previously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.520
in your life maybe when you felt about condemning&nbsp;
for that or in the lives of others because when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.760
we get to be judging right we like to i say&nbsp;
we when i say this a lot of times the church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.880
likes to take verses out of context and really&nbsp;
push people to the ground right so this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.520
next verse that they would read to anybody that&nbsp;
would be sexually immoral greedy and pure any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.280
of those horse joking they're gonna bring the&nbsp;
scripture up and they're gonna say this well for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.400
it says for no and recognize this every sexually&nbsp;
moral or impure or greedy person who is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:16.320
idolater does not have inheritance in the kingdom&nbsp;
of christ and of god throw that in your face right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:22.480
you're gonna know right let's not cause attention&nbsp;
what paul's attention is the severity the idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:30.240
behind if you're imitating and he uses this word&nbsp;
idolatry idolatry so anybody know what idolatry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.480
is i love that what does it mean whenever&nbsp;
someone says it's idolatry what you're doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:44.880
placing something higher than god right um and&nbsp;
so we think about this is if someone says i am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.880
a child of god and they are worshiping these&nbsp;
things living in these things as though they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.880 --> 00:15:00.080
are idols god is not their father so really what&nbsp;
paul is saying is the way you're walking proves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:08.320
who you truly follow who you truly imitate and&nbsp;
again this is that part where i think paul's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.280
putting the mirror up every morning we should put&nbsp;
him around there's days where i walk through my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.360
life and i realize you know i haven't probably&nbsp;
been honoring the way that i've been treating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.640
my spouse or the way that i've been treating my&nbsp;
kids the way that i have thought today right and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.440
those should be the holy spirit should come&nbsp;
upon us right and convict us over sin and god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:33.760
is graciously ready to forgive you and help you to&nbsp;
overcome them so paul's not saying living this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.560
it's okay if that's you you're saying okay well i&nbsp;
guess i'm not going to help he's not saying we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.080
stay there you know he's saying you know i just&nbsp;
want to show the security of these things and why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:48.880
it's not good for you um and so we like to justify&nbsp;
our since anybody else's life justify their sins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:55.760
right a reason why i said you know stupid these&nbsp;
mornings because i didn't breakfast i didn't sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:01.840
all the time right rather than owning the same&nbsp;
that was sin i apologize i like to justify myself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:09.840
and so this is the part where um it's easy to&nbsp;
start saying you know well i i talk this way or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.440
i think this way sometimes it's only occasionally&nbsp;
it's okay and paul is again specifically speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:20.000
to people who idolize these things and live in&nbsp;
these things so as a christian i'll just ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.720
this is a yes or no question as a christian if we&nbsp;
have occasional sin like this is it is that okay

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.000
it shouldn't be right we know&nbsp;
that god's grace of balance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.560
but we should not continue on sinning because&nbsp;
we understand all that god has done for us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:41.120
and therefore because we understand we are a&nbsp;
child of god and so this is all about motivation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.840
right so this is not all condemning this is&nbsp;
paul motivating it's not valuable for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:52.640
this is not god's design for you this is not good&nbsp;
for you and here's why because it does obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.360
you are separated from god's kingdom and you&nbsp;
don't want to be because you want all the things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.360
that god gave us in chapters one through three of&nbsp;
occasions you want these things you should desire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.680
to have these things these are great things and&nbsp;
so he's really trying to motivate you to say hey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:13.520
choose jesus over these things those things aren't&nbsp;
good for you and so um john i want to make this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.000
statement he says be killing sin or sin to be&nbsp;
killing you and it's that idea that when we live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.040
in sin and idolatry it begins to just deteriorate&nbsp;
us and fall away from what god's designed to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:32.400
and and i know this that satan is alive right he&nbsp;
likes to still kill him destroy and he'll place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.920
these things in your life and then he'll make&nbsp;
you think you can never be forgiven but that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:41.840
never been god's intention so paul makes it clear&nbsp;
that people who deliberately and persistently live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.640
in sin will not share the kingdom of god but&nbsp;
we should never justify occasionally neither&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.840
but we should never live in occasional sense so&nbsp;
that's the part of it don't justify it confess it

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.720
um and that's really where we're we're&nbsp;
heading today is that idea behind how do we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.560
overcome these things maybe these are part of&nbsp;
your life or present someone's life it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.920
just recognizing it but learning how to overcome&nbsp;
this um and so know this that if you are a true&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.960
believer and you follow jesus conviction&nbsp;
will come and there are consequences to sin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.680
if anybody remembers the whole david's word right&nbsp;
david chose to not go to war which was unlike a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.240
king to not go to war he was setting himself up&nbsp;
for failure and he began to again he committed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:27.040
sin and there was consequences to that sin so as&nbsp;
a christian don't think just because grace abounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:32.160
there's no consequences to sin right and those&nbsp;
consequences are not about punishment as though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.760
like you're a bad person but it's also what to&nbsp;
draw back when i got a spanking from my parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.800
i didn't want to do the thing i did before right&nbsp;
it's all for a purpose to bring you back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:50.560
good graces and the good things that god is giving&nbsp;
us that's children right so as children of god we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.520
should imitate our fathers our father in heaven&nbsp;
and we know that these things would not be named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.080
among god but here's the question how do we fight&nbsp;
idolizing these sins and this is what we're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:07.520
to kind of cover these last couple verses to see&nbsp;
this he says in verses 6 and 7 he says let no one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:15.200
so is that anyone is that some people let&nbsp;
no one deceive you with empty arguments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.440
for god's wrath is coming on the disobedient so&nbsp;
it's almost like paul saying hey i just told you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.080
that you have no inheritance in the kingdom&nbsp;
of god if these things are present as an idol&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:29.360
in your life but he wanted to emphasize that he&nbsp;
says this don't let other people who may this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:35.120
really what he's saying other people who may&nbsp;
be claiming that they are followers of jesus

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:43.120
to see with empty arguments what are their empty&nbsp;
arguments it's okay to sin i mean grace balance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.560
god doesn't i mean here here's one of the things&nbsp;
as i began to study more and more today christians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:54.240
are justifying premarital sex after they've gotten&nbsp;
engaged because well we're going to be in there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.480
soon anyways and again this is me not sitting&nbsp;
here like out on you if that was you before you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.200
you came to faith in jesus and what it&nbsp;
what it's saying is as we begin to just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:09.040
slowly justify what's okay and and it's okay&nbsp;
and this thing's okay and this little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.560
here is okay and it's saying this is okay like&nbsp;
other believers will sometimes come alongside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.960
you and begin to tell you that sin is okay&nbsp;
you have to come back to god's words and say

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:39.360
right and we know this people around you can be&nbsp;
a major influence so let me give you an example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.640
um whenever i give my life to christ and&nbsp;
brittany recommitted her life to christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.520
it was in this season where we used to hang out&nbsp;
with our friends on fridays and saturday nights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:55.520
fridays and sundays and i remember the first&nbsp;
couple times after we had i got saved and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:01.920
rededicated your life that we would go to those&nbsp;
nights and we just realized if we continue to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.560
in these relationships these people we love them&nbsp;
but if we stay in these relationships we knew what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:13.040
we're heading back to now this is the question so&nbsp;
what do we do we actually said hey we're not going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.280
to come over on friday we still had dinner with&nbsp;
them we hung out with them outside the context&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:24.160
of the friday and saturday nights of things that&nbsp;
just wasn't valuable for us so the question is if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.840
jesus was afraid of sinners so shouldn't you be&nbsp;
around sinners and love on them and absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:35.760
you shouldn't but if it ever leads you to the&nbsp;
opportunity to send so let me give you an example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:42.880
an alcoholic that really has an issue should never&nbsp;
go to a bar to reach me why they're too tempted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.960
you can reach them in your home right you can&nbsp;
you can find a place that's not going to tempt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.400
you and draw you into sin it means that you're&nbsp;
not saying you're too good for them or god's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:02.400
do differently what you're saying is but i have&nbsp;
to protect myself again from from basically the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.440
influence of other people and that sometimes that&nbsp;
comes across negative to people and you have to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.920
i love you so much but i just can't be&nbsp;
around these things i can't listen to these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.800
conversations there's times you just walk away&nbsp;
from a conversation you can't listen to they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.840
not valuable for you right somebody's watching&nbsp;
something it's not valuable for you and you're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.640
being rude but for you and you're protecting&nbsp;
your purity you know that leads you to list

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.600
and so i think it's important for us to&nbsp;
understand that we're not perfect right but we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:40.240
we still have to protect that idea behind it&nbsp;
our purity of what what god is telling us here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.080
so when it comes to sin let me ask this question

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.120
do you think it's oh my let me just read&nbsp;
your strengths right now i have a believer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:51.120 --> 00:23:00.560
is it different um for the sin and the life of&nbsp;
a believer that is from an unbeliever so is it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:09.440
different for the believer to have sinned in life&nbsp;
than unbelievable is it different yes tell me why

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:19.280
unbelievers are held accountable they're unaware&nbsp;
sometimes right they're not at the moment of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.320
salvation and again this is the spiritual side of&nbsp;
us and as we grow in god's word we understand the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:31.200
knowledge of it it's different it's worse because&nbsp;
we know better we're deliberately disobeying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.840
god and an unbeliever many times doesn't&nbsp;
understand that they're not held accountable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.200
and so that's that part again where we sometimes&nbsp;
are influenced by our non-obligation friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.160
and we give the light of the world that we're not&nbsp;
trying to condemn them that's not our role god's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:52.160
never called us a judgment world but he's called&nbsp;
us to see truth he's called us to live truth and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:52.160 --> 00:24:00.080
be a light and and set the example um and so&nbsp;
when you're emptying jesus we should realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.400
that those things should not be named about this&nbsp;
right it's all stuck they're not beneficial for us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.960
they can lead us astray from god in our&nbsp;
relationship they set a bad example for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:14.000
the lost world and other believers and so again&nbsp;
we know the importance of being around other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.280
believers or others people who struggle with&nbsp;
these sins but not in a way that would lead us

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.600
to fall into that sense i want to read this&nbsp;
verse first corinthians 6 18 through 20 says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:33.360
this this is paul speaking he says flee sexual&nbsp;
immorality every other sin a person commits is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:40.080
outside the body but the person who's is sexually&nbsp;
moral sins against his own body don't you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.840
that your body is a temple of the holy&nbsp;
spirit who is in you whom you have from god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:53.280
you are not your own you were at a price so&nbsp;
glorify god with your body so it's that moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.720
when you read these verses it's we begin&nbsp;
to realize like at the moment of salvation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:05.040
this body where sexual immorality can dwell is&nbsp;
not mine anymore it's not meant for my own desires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.600
it's been for his it's meant for his holiness and&nbsp;
i think about that that instance where he talks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:15.440
about where now our body's the temple if you&nbsp;
studied at all any of the old testament you'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.480
understand the temple was the place where god was&nbsp;
and it's pure they brought things in there then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.120
they sacrificed to clean sins and this is you know&nbsp;
i mean i remember the on the other side of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.440
veil where these priests would go they actually&nbsp;
literally had any sins before they crossed it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.400
so they had introduced their sins and if they&nbsp;
weren't what they would do is they would tie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.280
a rope around a person's leg when they would go&nbsp;
across the veil if they ended up going in with sin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:43.760
unconfessed sin they would die in the presence&nbsp;
of the lord they dragged him this is idea behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.120
we are now in the temple the spirit of&nbsp;
god lives inside of us and so we should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:56.560
not have these sins among us because we are gods&nbsp;
completely and so anybody remember joseph's story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.400
uh at pod first house anybody&nbsp;
remember that one so again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.320
joseph goes there as a slave and he ends up moving&nbsp;
up the ranks and ends up basically controlling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:12.480
everything in poverty everything and joseph says&nbsp;
everything but his wife has been given over to and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:20.160
his wife potiphar's black tries to persuade him&nbsp;
to sleep with her and it's this idea that joseph&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:26.240
flees from her because he even admits he&nbsp;
knows the truth he's confessing the truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.840
potter is giving me everything he accepts you&nbsp;
how can i go get some abilities even saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:37.040
god has to write all these things for me how can&nbsp;
i sing against my god and he flees and his cloak

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.880
these things are around us based upon&nbsp;
joseph's story we should believe we should run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.080
and then that's that's the challenge what's the&nbsp;
answer the answer is to run from these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:06.080
flee from them don't hang around this is the&nbsp;
thought like joseph didn't hang around and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:13.280
like let's talk through this you know he he&nbsp;
got away from him because guys we apart from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.640
jesus coming back we're always&nbsp;
going to have this war inside of us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:26.640
right to the desired sin and place in the wrong&nbsp;
situation we will give over to that right so it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:32.800
not even placing yourself in those situations and&nbsp;
so when it comes to sin i was challenged with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:38.480
thought a long time ago because we don't just say&nbsp;
notice him we say yes to jesus because think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:44.640
this when you're saying no no no what are you&nbsp;
doing you're thinking but if you'll say no to sin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:50.320
and you start saying yes to jesus yes jesus you're&nbsp;
renewing your mind to consistently think of jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:56.640
in his pure ways and his more valuable ways in the&nbsp;
context of the relationships that god's given you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:03.200
so say yes over and over again place yourself in&nbsp;
opportunities and renew your mind with this word&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:12.640
that says yes to these positive things so how&nbsp;
do we kind of summarize this today so we learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:19.120
as imitators of jesus we should watch how we walk&nbsp;
and watch how we talk right and i think those two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:25.120
things prove the reality of our faith in jesus&nbsp;
and no this is not a work salvation because i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:30.320
think a lot of times it's like well if i do these&nbsp;
two things then i'm safe right but it's a response&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:38.720
it's a response to what christ has done for us&nbsp;
not what gets a salvation it's a response from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:44.000
one guy so that's why he says therefore because&nbsp;
of what christ has done for us we walk these ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.240
so know that i'm not saying that this is a work's&nbsp;
salvation right but practically speaking how do we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.040
fight these things so i'm gonna give you a couple&nbsp;
of things number one don't conceal it confess it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.520
if there's sin in your life and maybe you know you&nbsp;
heard this list today maybe something in there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.360
applying to you right maybe it's something you're&nbsp;
viewing maybe it's something you're thinking maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:12.960
it's the way you're talking whatever it is confess&nbsp;
to god here's my challenge to find somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:20.000
that you can trust to confess it out loud to&nbsp;
why there's accountability in it and if you'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.680
find somebody that's in this room or back there&nbsp;
starting in children's ministry maybe somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.320
another christian that you respect they're not&nbsp;
going to condemn you they're going to wrap their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.040
arm around you and say i'm proud of you because&nbsp;
of your your willingness to invest something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:38.240
that may be dark but your willingness to want to&nbsp;
overcome it right you want us to overcome it so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:45.600
don't conceal it confess it james 5 16 says this&nbsp;
therefore confess your sins to one another and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.960
pray for one another so that you may be healed the&nbsp;
prayer of a righteous person is very powerful and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.600
it's an effect so again we look at this verse and&nbsp;
i'm i've actually quoted this verse multiple times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.320
the prayer of a righteous verse is very powerful&nbsp;
in its effect and i believe that wholeheartedly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:05.520
but let's look at the context of this it's in&nbsp;
the context of confessing sin to one another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:10.800
so that you may be healed so if we have&nbsp;
to be healed he's not talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:17.360
swords on our arm he's talking about&nbsp;
the swords in our heart and our soul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:26.960
the sin that entangling you may is&nbsp;
some of these you're injured and prayer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:36.240
confession to other believers into god can&nbsp;
heal you that's exactly what that scripture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.000
and so we need to heal from our guilt and&nbsp;
that's one of the things too i'm telling you sin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.880
wants to drive you down and say you're&nbsp;
worthless but god says you're worth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.880
so much to me that he gave his&nbsp;
life for you so don't let that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:55.360
run in your mind so here's another one so don't&nbsp;
conceal it confess it don't fight it flee from it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.280
so you heard me say earlier i thought this was&nbsp;
interesting as i was kind of writing this and i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:05.680
was kind of walking through this we were fighting&nbsp;
for purity in our marriages and our singleness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.480
but in this idea here it says don't&nbsp;
fight it flee from it it is this idea of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.680
and then how does this happen let's&nbsp;
throw some things out there for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.920
if you're struggling with alcohol and sit in&nbsp;
your fridge what do you think that's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.000
do it's going to cause you to go there any time&nbsp;
that you're struggling with something right to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.720
find sooner than that so here's&nbsp;
another one i'm going to step out there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.280
when it comes to your phone or your computer don't&nbsp;
leave it wide open where you can do anything you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:41.360
want to do put something on there put people&nbsp;
accountable asking you what you're feeling right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.480
not because you're this horrible person but&nbsp;
because you want it to be protected you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.960
to protect your rights so we are going to&nbsp;
not fight it right we're not going to fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:58.400
it or we're going to flee from it we're trying to&nbsp;
flee and i love this statement i heard yesterday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:03.680
and it just challenged me i had to write this in&nbsp;
why resist the temptation in the future when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:10.080
can eliminate it today i want to say that again&nbsp;
why resist a temptation in the future when you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.400
eliminate today so this is where i say you may be&nbsp;
hearing everything you're hearing today and saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.800
we don't struggle with that we don't have problems&nbsp;
with our marriage we're gonna have problems with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:23.360
you anything we're gonna talk anything what are&nbsp;
you doing to place now to prevent future issues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.800
and these are even things for me and you guys&nbsp;
have this i i've been said so like i don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.000
meet individually with women but there's times&nbsp;
i'm texting some of you guys individually and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.600
i'm like i've got to get back to texting you&nbsp;
guys with your husband or with bernie in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.080
text messages why not because i think anything in&nbsp;
pure is going to happen in there really i don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:45.360
but i'm protecting myself i'm protecting&nbsp;
you well that sounds foolish no it's saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:50.800
that i love my wife and my relationship with&nbsp;
jesus and my walk as a pastor as a christian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.920
more over who would condemn me for wanting to do&nbsp;
that there's more to there's more of that purity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.760
when it comes to outside sexual issues when it&nbsp;
comes to sin any other sin that we're dealing with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.920
again i'm gonna say this why is&nbsp;
this temptation in the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:11.760
today i i challenge you to really internalize&nbsp;
that what that means for you um and so let me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.080
just kind of just just close it this way again i&nbsp;
don't know what you're struggling with maybe it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:22.320
sexual immorality impurity maybe it's greed right&nbsp;
maybe it's some of this obscene or foolish talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:29.680
today's the day i've been there before i&nbsp;
sat and seen and i'm like next week tomorrow

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.520
or i just i can't just because i'm going to&nbsp;
ignore it but today's the day you deal with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.720
it right don't let the sunset before we deal with&nbsp;
it place accountability in your life to prevent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.600
those opportunities in the future it doesn't&nbsp;
matter how strong you are today we have those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:50.960
moments of weakness that destroy our future and&nbsp;
i think of david right david was a man for god's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:58.000
own heart and there was no accountability to&nbsp;
what happened and not only the child's life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.440
was taken but even his kingdom was&nbsp;
taken and placed in the son's hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.360
there's major consequences to adding in&nbsp;
accountability and we can prevent those right so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.600
here's my encouragement during invitation i just&nbsp;
encourage you to go to god and ask for forgiveness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.880
for anything that comes to mind over these things&nbsp;
or other things i i pray that you ask god for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.600
accountability you know your person's coming into&nbsp;
your life to bring accountability in those areas

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:29.360
go to god and surrender again you you&nbsp;
may heard the sentences today i'm sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.880
none of those but there's something that god's&nbsp;
placed on your heart that you need to address

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.560
and i think that's the struggle sometimes as we&nbsp;
look at this oh are you judging me absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:57.040
not neither is paul he's just not beneficial for&nbsp;
you so you can't defeat this alone don't conceal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:07.120
it confess it don't fight it flee from him come to&nbsp;
jesus he is grace abounds more and more i'll i'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:12.720
say one more thing if you're sitting here listen&nbsp;
to this and you're idolizing new things and maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.840
you're questioning do i have a true relationship&nbsp;
with jesus have i given my life to jesus

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:22.160
you know you can know today there's&nbsp;
so many conversations that i've had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.600
in membership meetings where a person&nbsp;
says i want to go back and i want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.320
i think i was saved at 13 i think i was saved&nbsp;
at 17 but i really wrestled with these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.840
here and there and they're like trying to justify&nbsp;
their salvation at these ages and i'm like that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.320
great if you want to if that's what you feel&nbsp;
like you're saved in i'm not questioning that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.520
but why question something when today you know&nbsp;
and complain today as your salvation you cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:48.640
wonder anymore and today is the day of salvation&nbsp;
and you walk in freedom and not question it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:54.960
that's offered to you that if you're struggling&nbsp;
with that there's no reason to try to justify&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.920
something that may have not been there or maybe&nbsp;
it has who's gonna criticize you here nobody we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:05.120
gonna celebrate that it's one step closer to jesus&nbsp;
that you want to prioritize today's day so if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.520
don't know jesus and you want to know jesus come&nbsp;
talk to me after service don't let another day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:22.480
pass by and you say okay maybe let it be today&nbsp;
let it be today so let's pray lord jesus um today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:29.360
lord as we open up this text lord i know there's&nbsp;
some uncomfortableness in it even as a pastor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:36.480
to walk through this or because it begins to&nbsp;
really look at the depths of our heart and maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:44.880
really lay open our hearts forward to a point&nbsp;
where we see some errors in our ways and the ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:52.320
that we think or we talk or we we act and lord&nbsp;
today is all about healing it's all about healing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.520
but we can overcome these things because you&nbsp;
have conquered them by your death on the cross&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:04.240
and resurrection back to life lord i pray that&nbsp;
we lay down every sin that so easily entangles us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.320
and lord we pick up our cross daily and&nbsp;
we follow you and lord as we follow you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.840
when we are free from these sins lord it will be&nbsp;
amazing how we can run the race that you called us

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:24.320
thank you so much for the therefore&nbsp;
because therefore you did so much for us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:34.560
and that is why we strive to walk in love and&nbsp;
imitate you help us address anything more that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.560
have sinned against you or someone else may we&nbsp;
confess that lord knowing that you are really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:49.840
given us freedom from it that's the lord we just&nbsp;
pray all this and your heavenly name jesus amen
