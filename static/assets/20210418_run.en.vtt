00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.080
want to imitate god and safety 
is this we need to follow you  

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.120
um and when it comes to following following it's 
not something that you do occasionally right  

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.360
to really grasp the guidance and move that 
consistently in order to imitate we use the  

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.240
example of cody imitating uh michael jordan right 
that didn't happen overnight it was consistent  

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.320
uh consistently so we learned that from last 
week and i was just i'm just reminded by this  

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.040
luke 9 23 says if anyone wants to follow after 
me this is jesus speaking let him deny himself  

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.560
take up his cross barely and follow me um it's 
just again a reminder that it's it's a daily  

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.120
sacrifice to follow it's not an occasional and so 
i again just i just want to ask this question just  

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.040
kind of as we get going how many go on here by 
raising hands one to imitating jesus in your life  

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.720
okay sounds like we got the majority 
of jason doesn't want to imitate jesus

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.360
um so again it's just setting this ton of this 
idea of everybody in here is raising their hands  

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.760
they want to annotate jesus we really want to 
follow jesus but we're getting ready to jump  

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.280
off into some interesting topic right topics and 
this is the part where we can kind of get a little  

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.720
uncomfortable um it's okay can we hardly 
get through this but this is going to be  

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.600
something where i'm going to challenge you to 
stay focused um as we really walk through this  

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.440
internalize this for the value of yourself 
and those maybe you're walking alongside of  

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.480
um as they're going to their faith um but just 
again in these two verses we realize that paul's  

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.480
telling us to focus on jesus and when we're 
focusing on jesus we're less distracted by the  

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.520
other things right around us and that's exactly 
what i believe paul started off this way imitate  

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.200
jesus follow him in love right um before we talk 
about these things so let's read this text here  

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.960
again ephesians chapter five verses three 
through seven i'm just gonna start with verse one  

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.720
just to kind of set up where we're kind of 
continuing from last week so he says therefore  

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.080
be imitators of god as dearly loved 
children and walk in love as christ  

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.960
also loved us and gave himself for us a 
sacrificial and fragrant offering to god  

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.560
but sexual immorality and impurity or greed should 
not even be heard among you as is proper for  

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.200
the saints obscene and foolish talking or cruel 
joking are not suitable but rather giving thanks  

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.560
for know and recognize this every sexual immoral 
or impure or greedy person who is an idolater  

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.040
does not have any inheritance in the kingdom 
of christ and of god let no one deceive you  

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.040
with empty arguments for god's wrath is coming on 
the disobedient because of these things therefore  

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.000
do not become their partners so let's pray just 
invite god into opening our hearts to this text  

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.240
lord jesus um we're so thankful again for you and 
your presence in this place because we're two or  

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.560
three gathering your name lord you are amongst 
us and so we're thank you for that thank you  

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.080
for this word uh that you've given us to really 
look at in light of everything you've done for us  

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.760
and lord let us leave here walking uh in the  

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.720
light that you called us to walk and um 
we just pray this in your heavenly name  

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.680
amen amen so we see here um that paul is now 
transitioning he's basically going to discuss  

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.000
the purity of our walk when it comes to imitating 
jesus and uh again you may look at this this first  

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.080
verse here and think okay this doesn't apply to me 
you know let's let's move on but let's let's look  

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.680
at the depth of really what he's saying but sexual 
immorality so what is sexual immorality it's  

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.680
really any sexual activity outside the biblical 
marriage um and so just to go a step further  

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.400
you know most of you probably think in your mind 
what exactly is that um that would be this right  

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.800
premarital sex same sex relation adultery viewing 
or watching pornography and then he goes in and he  

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.240
says any impurity so just in case maybe you said 
hey you didn't mention one thing that maybe it's  

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.360
okay to do he says in any impurity and so it's 
really just that idea of any lust or pure moves um  

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.440
so this basically covers any of our excuses from 
one of these away and then he talks about green  

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.160
any greedy desire to have more covetousness um and 
so he's basically saying this all of these things  

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.600
are sin and i remember this idea against sin is 
it's not that okay we're bad people because we  

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.240
do these things we think these things we say these 
things but it's this idea that it's not valuable  

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.480
for you it's not beneficial for you that's 
really where pulse can you imitate jesus that's  

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.240
beneficial it's life-giving these things are not 
life-giving right they're actually struggling  

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.240
they cause a struggle in your life and i remember 
hearing this statement and i had to go flying to  

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.280
figure out exactly what it was but it said but it 
said sin will take you farther than you want to go  

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.840
keep you longer than you want to stay 
and cost you more than you want to pay  

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.840
and so he's very specific none of you should be 
named or heard among you so who is paul directly  

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.680
speaking to i'm actually saying he's called 
directly speaking these things should not be  

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:14.240
named among christians the saints right those who 
would say i want to answer christ so based upon he  

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.240
raised my hand earlier you just said hey i don't 
want to walk in this so that's a good thing right  

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.240
that's what he's saying he says anyone should 
not be named among you and this is the part where  

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.320
okay great again let's move on we know what 
we're talking about there's this is great okay  

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.920
we want to talk anymore but paul specifically 
is talking to believers in the church and so  

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.960
just from my little bit of research 
and what you may already understand  

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.480
without me saying this is do you think that that 
same problem is still in the church some of these  

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:51.840
things these mentions yeah it is and if you really 
begin to do a lot of studying you'll find that um  

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.480
some of the the major reasons for uh or well 
leaders come back let's go back a little further  

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.600
the divorce rate in the church and outside the 
church is about the same and most of them come  

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.240
from these types of things we're just talking 
about um you'll also find that i think it's  

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.600
somewhere out there that says somewhere between 
60 to 70 of people within the church actually  

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.080
view or visit pornography so it's actually 
an issue within the church and when i began  

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.200
to even think a little bit further on this and 
thinking okay if paul's speaking to the church  

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.120
and he's talking about you know and i brought 
him that whole idea of so divorce it's the  

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.400
same in the church as it's outside of the church 
what that's my thing what's the major causes of  

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.640
divorce within the church so i'll give you 
three top reasons um number one adultery  

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.880
um within the church we're within people who 
are believers it's adultery so that fits in with  

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:58.320
sexual morality number two drugs are alcoholics 
so indian period um financial problems create  

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.240
disagreements so you think about what's paul 
speaking to here he's speaking to things that  

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.640
are not valuable for you to destroy relationships 
to destroy the things that god has designed  

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.800
to be pure um we see effect obviously when we're 
in pure thoughts or this sexual immorality and so  

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.560
um most of us would say okay again here's 
the first three things we're just gonna  

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.200
continue to talk we don't have issues with 
that maybe in my marriage or if i'm single

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.200
in our marriages or even as a single 
person um we're already losing god  

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.320
uh in this and so we can't win the war by sitting 
still we have to attack we have to be prepared  

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.880
for this and we're going to continue to talk on 
this that today would be easy for you to sit here  

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.800
and listen to these things and maybe you struggle 
with someone or maybe you don't and you're sitting  

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.080
here it's okay what's the value we're going to 
talk about some practical steps to overcome some  

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.560
of this um but here here let me let me kind of 
give you this before we go on the next section  

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:12.000
the things we talked about sexual immorality any 
impurity or greed do you know that within the the  

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.720
pure forms of those god has given us those things 
to enjoy so let me tell you that what god has  

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:23.120
given us in a right relationship with these things 
um and so from a sexual relationship within the  

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:29.360
marriage was designed for good was designed for 
enjoyment was designed for exactly what so sexual  

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.880
purity within the marriage god gave us right he 
didn't give a sexual immorality but he gave us the  

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.160
appearance of it right so purity in itself rather 
than imperial purity itself is really innocence  

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:47.600
or freedom from uh condemnation when i think 
about that is whenever we're in beard whenever  

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.120
again i think it was as a kid whenever i sinned 
whenever there were some things that was impaired  

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.240
i felt guilty so purity is the guiltless feeling 
right that we are appeared before god and the last  

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.800
one was contentment or generosity right realizing 
we have an obscene we have more than we need and  

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:11.120
giving it away and so all of those things are the 
positive sides the good sides the things that god  

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:17.200
has given us as children of god to live in to walk 
in and to enjoy but he mentioned the things that  

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.960
weren't right so this is what god gives us but 
paul doesn't just stop and talk about the purity  

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.360
of her walks he wants to get down to the people 
that we're talking so how many of y'all know  

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.080
um that what comes out of our mouth 
starts with what's in our hearts  

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:40.880
anybody i mean you don't just say things randomly 
it comes from some deep-seated heart thought or  

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.920
that you rely on your life so paul's 
mourning against the sins of the tongue which  

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.320
again we understand that but really verses three 
and four they connect together if we're doing one  

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.000
the other one's probably present and if we're so 
to think about it if you're sexually moral you're  

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.840
probably talking about sexually moral things and 
and we'll just kind of walk through what this is  

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.600
so he says here in verse four he says obscene 
and foolish talking or cruel joking are not  

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.960
suitable but rather give them thanks so we're 
gonna talk about that because it's interesting  

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.320
when i read those three things and he says rather 
give him things i'm like how does that fit but so  

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.560
what is obscene talking again this would really be 
attributed to talking about sexual internal things  

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.000
um he talks about foolish talking and this 
was translated i love this stupid speaking  

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.320
and there's been some times i probably stupidly 
spoke for sure stupidly radically weird garrison  

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.640
uh but but basically that's speaking without 
self-control trash talking or speaking right so  

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.040
these things aren't beneficial for gears that 
we're speaking with and the last one is this  

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:52.000
crude joking that says vulgar or loot or foul 
mouth and when i think about crew joking god's not  

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.840
saying you can't have a hammer in your life right 
because we all like joking and having fun this  

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:03.440
is idea of um nothing that is rude dirty or mean 
spirited um and so he says but rather give thanks  

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:10.720
and so when you think of a believer and we're 
really coming out of verses one and two we want to  

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.840
imitate god remember christ and so everything that 
paul just mentioned i think all of us would say  

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:23.200
those probably were not in the mouth of jesus nor 
the thoughts of jesus right those weren't even  

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.840
named among them so it makes sense why paul is 
putting in these hours these should not be a part  

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.960
of our life and he says that we should give thanks 
to god we should be anything that comes out of our  

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.560
mouth should be giving god glory is really what 
i'm saying anything that we say should be able  

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.240
to be an offering back to god and these things 
are not an offering to god they're really really  

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:51.680
obviously so the question is why is that not 
valuable right because the way that we talk  

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:59.920
again it's a hard issue it can lead us astray but 
here here's the bigger issue to this is we now  

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.680
are lights the world and at the point 
that we are alive to the world anything  

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.720
that comes up our mouth i i think about my 
kids there's sometimes just so you guys know  

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.920
dads make mistakes there's times times i use 
the word stupid around my kids that's stupid  

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.880
and there's probably some of the words i use 
and you know what my kids started yelling  

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.880
that's stupid and then you 
know what immediately my heart

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.920
and so what we think about as as mature christians 
because this is really what what paul's talking  

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.880
about as we grow in our faith as we make sure up 
other christians are watching you especially if  

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:49.520
they look up to you if you allow it are they gonna 
allow yeah well if so and so the pastor says that  

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.760
my friend says that that goes to church who 
loves jesus that means i can say that or  

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.560
they act that way they think it's okay i'll 
do that and so when you think oh no they read  

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.480
their bible they should know that that's 
not true that was just a moment of sin no  

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.240
really people are watching us and 
so that should cause us to go okay

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.320
and so again it's not valuable so this is that 
that whole everybody remember the whole bracelet  

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:20.400
face t-shirt face wwjd every day we should walk 
around what would jesus do what would jesus say  

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:29.040
and it's that idea of you know everything that we 
do or we say it is a lie to those around us and so  

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:35.920
um when we when we think about where we're getting 
ready to head as well it really starts getting  

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:42.560
this point where um you could really feel the 
weight of sin maybe in your life maybe previously  

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.520
in your life maybe when you felt about condemning 
for that or in the lives of others because when  

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.760
we get to be judging right we like to i say 
we when i say this a lot of times the church  

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.880
likes to take verses out of context and really 
push people to the ground right so this is the  

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.520
next verse that they would read to anybody that 
would be sexually immoral greedy and pure any  

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.280
of those horse joking they're gonna bring the 
scripture up and they're gonna say this well for  

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.400
it says for no and recognize this every sexually 
moral or impure or greedy person who is an  

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:16.320
idolater does not have inheritance in the kingdom 
of christ and of god throw that in your face right  

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:22.480
you're gonna know right let's not cause attention 
what paul's attention is the severity the idea  

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:30.240
behind if you're imitating and he uses this word 
idolatry idolatry so anybody know what idolatry  

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.480
is i love that what does it mean whenever 
someone says it's idolatry what you're doing  

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:44.880
placing something higher than god right um and 
so we think about this is if someone says i am  

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.880
a child of god and they are worshiping these 
things living in these things as though they  

00:14:50.880 --> 00:15:00.080
are idols god is not their father so really what 
paul is saying is the way you're walking proves  

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:08.320
who you truly follow who you truly imitate and 
again this is that part where i think paul's  

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.280
putting the mirror up every morning we should put 
him around there's days where i walk through my  

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.360
life and i realize you know i haven't probably 
been honoring the way that i've been treating  

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.640
my spouse or the way that i've been treating my 
kids the way that i have thought today right and  

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.440
those should be the holy spirit should come 
upon us right and convict us over sin and god  

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:33.760
is graciously ready to forgive you and help you to 
overcome them so paul's not saying living this and  

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.560
it's okay if that's you you're saying okay well i 
guess i'm not going to help he's not saying we'll  

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.080
stay there you know he's saying you know i just 
want to show the security of these things and why  

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:48.880
it's not good for you um and so we like to justify 
our since anybody else's life justify their sins  

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:55.760
right a reason why i said you know stupid these 
mornings because i didn't breakfast i didn't sleep  

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:01.840
all the time right rather than owning the same 
that was sin i apologize i like to justify myself  

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:09.840
and so this is the part where um it's easy to 
start saying you know well i i talk this way or  

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.440
i think this way sometimes it's only occasionally 
it's okay and paul is again specifically speaking  

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:20.000
to people who idolize these things and live in 
these things so as a christian i'll just ask  

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.720
this is a yes or no question as a christian if we 
have occasional sin like this is it is that okay

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.000
it shouldn't be right we know 
that god's grace of balance  

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.560
but we should not continue on sinning because 
we understand all that god has done for us  

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:41.120
and therefore because we understand we are a 
child of god and so this is all about motivation  

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.840
right so this is not all condemning this is 
paul motivating it's not valuable for you  

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:52.640
this is not god's design for you this is not good 
for you and here's why because it does obviously  

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.360
you are separated from god's kingdom and you 
don't want to be because you want all the things  

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.360
that god gave us in chapters one through three of 
occasions you want these things you should desire  

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.680
to have these things these are great things and 
so he's really trying to motivate you to say hey  

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:13.520
choose jesus over these things those things aren't 
good for you and so um john i want to make this  

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.000
statement he says be killing sin or sin to be 
killing you and it's that idea that when we live  

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.040
in sin and idolatry it begins to just deteriorate 
us and fall away from what god's designed to be  

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:32.400
and and i know this that satan is alive right he 
likes to still kill him destroy and he'll place  

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.920
these things in your life and then he'll make 
you think you can never be forgiven but that's  

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:41.840
never been god's intention so paul makes it clear 
that people who deliberately and persistently live  

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.640
in sin will not share the kingdom of god but 
we should never justify occasionally neither  

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.840
but we should never live in occasional sense so 
that's the part of it don't justify it confess it

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.720
um and that's really where we're we're 
heading today is that idea behind how do we  

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.560
overcome these things maybe these are part of 
your life or present someone's life it's not  

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.920
just recognizing it but learning how to overcome 
this um and so know this that if you are a true  

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.960
believer and you follow jesus conviction 
will come and there are consequences to sin  

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.680
if anybody remembers the whole david's word right 
david chose to not go to war which was unlike a  

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.240
king to not go to war he was setting himself up 
for failure and he began to again he committed to  

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:27.040
sin and there was consequences to that sin so as 
a christian don't think just because grace abounds  

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:32.160
there's no consequences to sin right and those 
consequences are not about punishment as though  

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.760
like you're a bad person but it's also what to 
draw back when i got a spanking from my parents  

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.800
i didn't want to do the thing i did before right 
it's all for a purpose to bring you back to the  

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:50.560
good graces and the good things that god is giving 
us that's children right so as children of god we  

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.520
should imitate our fathers our father in heaven 
and we know that these things would not be named  

00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.080
among god but here's the question how do we fight 
idolizing these sins and this is what we're going  

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:07.520
to kind of cover these last couple verses to see 
this he says in verses 6 and 7 he says let no one  

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:15.200
so is that anyone is that some people let 
no one deceive you with empty arguments  

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.440
for god's wrath is coming on the disobedient so 
it's almost like paul saying hey i just told you  

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.080
that you have no inheritance in the kingdom 
of god if these things are present as an idol  

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:29.360
in your life but he wanted to emphasize that he 
says this don't let other people who may this is  

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:35.120
really what he's saying other people who may 
be claiming that they are followers of jesus

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:43.120
to see with empty arguments what are their empty 
arguments it's okay to sin i mean grace balance  

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.560
god doesn't i mean here here's one of the things 
as i began to study more and more today christians  

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:54.240
are justifying premarital sex after they've gotten 
engaged because well we're going to be in there  

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.480
soon anyways and again this is me not sitting 
here like out on you if that was you before you  

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.200
you came to faith in jesus and what it 
what it's saying is as we begin to just  

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:09.040
slowly justify what's okay and and it's okay 
and this thing's okay and this little bit  

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.560
here is okay and it's saying this is okay like 
other believers will sometimes come alongside  

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.960
you and begin to tell you that sin is okay 
you have to come back to god's words and say

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:39.360
right and we know this people around you can be 
a major influence so let me give you an example  

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.640
um whenever i give my life to christ and 
brittany recommitted her life to christ  

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.520
it was in this season where we used to hang out 
with our friends on fridays and saturday nights  

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:55.520
fridays and sundays and i remember the first 
couple times after we had i got saved and she  

00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:01.920
rededicated your life that we would go to those 
nights and we just realized if we continue to stay  

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.560
in these relationships these people we love them 
but if we stay in these relationships we knew what  

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:13.040
we're heading back to now this is the question so 
what do we do we actually said hey we're not going  

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.280
to come over on friday we still had dinner with 
them we hung out with them outside the context  

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:24.160
of the friday and saturday nights of things that 
just wasn't valuable for us so the question is if  

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.840
jesus was afraid of sinners so shouldn't you be 
around sinners and love on them and absolutely  

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:35.760
you shouldn't but if it ever leads you to the 
opportunity to send so let me give you an example  

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:42.880
an alcoholic that really has an issue should never 
go to a bar to reach me why they're too tempted  

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.960
you can reach them in your home right you can 
you can find a place that's not going to tempt  

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.400
you and draw you into sin it means that you're 
not saying you're too good for them or god's  

00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:02.400
do differently what you're saying is but i have 
to protect myself again from from basically the  

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.440
influence of other people and that sometimes that 
comes across negative to people and you have to be  

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.920
i love you so much but i just can't be 
around these things i can't listen to these  

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.800
conversations there's times you just walk away 
from a conversation you can't listen to they're  

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.840
not valuable for you right somebody's watching 
something it's not valuable for you and you're not  

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.640
being rude but for you and you're protecting 
your purity you know that leads you to list

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.600
and so i think it's important for us to 
understand that we're not perfect right but we  

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:40.240
we still have to protect that idea behind it 
our purity of what what god is telling us here  

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.080
so when it comes to sin let me ask this question

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.120
do you think it's oh my let me just read 
your strengths right now i have a believer  

00:22:51.120 --> 00:23:00.560
is it different um for the sin and the life of 
a believer that is from an unbeliever so is it  

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:09.440
different for the believer to have sinned in life 
than unbelievable is it different yes tell me why

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:19.280
unbelievers are held accountable they're unaware 
sometimes right they're not at the moment of  

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.320
salvation and again this is the spiritual side of 
us and as we grow in god's word we understand the  

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:31.200
knowledge of it it's different it's worse because 
we know better we're deliberately disobeying  

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.840
god and an unbeliever many times doesn't 
understand that they're not held accountable  

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.200
and so that's that part again where we sometimes 
are influenced by our non-obligation friends  

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.160
and we give the light of the world that we're not 
trying to condemn them that's not our role god's  

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:52.160
never called us a judgment world but he's called 
us to see truth he's called us to live truth and  

00:23:52.160 --> 00:24:00.080
be a light and and set the example um and so 
when you're emptying jesus we should realize  

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.400
that those things should not be named about this 
right it's all stuck they're not beneficial for us  

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.960
they can lead us astray from god in our 
relationship they set a bad example for  

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:14.000
the lost world and other believers and so again 
we know the importance of being around other  

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.280
believers or others people who struggle with 
these sins but not in a way that would lead us

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.600
to fall into that sense i want to read this 
verse first corinthians 6 18 through 20 says  

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:33.360
this this is paul speaking he says flee sexual 
immorality every other sin a person commits is  

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:40.080
outside the body but the person who's is sexually 
moral sins against his own body don't you know  

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.840
that your body is a temple of the holy 
spirit who is in you whom you have from god  

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:53.280
you are not your own you were at a price so 
glorify god with your body so it's that moment  

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.720
when you read these verses it's we begin 
to realize like at the moment of salvation  

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:05.040
this body where sexual immorality can dwell is 
not mine anymore it's not meant for my own desires  

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.600
it's been for his it's meant for his holiness and 
i think about that that instance where he talks  

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:15.440
about where now our body's the temple if you 
studied at all any of the old testament you'll  

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.480
understand the temple was the place where god was 
and it's pure they brought things in there then  

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.120
they sacrificed to clean sins and this is you know 
i mean i remember the on the other side of the  

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.440
veil where these priests would go they actually 
literally had any sins before they crossed it  

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.400
so they had introduced their sins and if they 
weren't what they would do is they would tie  

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.280
a rope around a person's leg when they would go 
across the veil if they ended up going in with sin  

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:43.760
unconfessed sin they would die in the presence 
of the lord they dragged him this is idea behind  

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.120
we are now in the temple the spirit of 
god lives inside of us and so we should  

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:56.560
not have these sins among us because we are gods 
completely and so anybody remember joseph's story  

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.400
uh at pod first house anybody 
remember that one so again  

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.320
joseph goes there as a slave and he ends up moving 
up the ranks and ends up basically controlling  

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:12.480
everything in poverty everything and joseph says 
everything but his wife has been given over to and  

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:20.160
his wife potiphar's black tries to persuade him 
to sleep with her and it's this idea that joseph  

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:26.240
flees from her because he even admits he 
knows the truth he's confessing the truth  

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.840
potter is giving me everything he accepts you 
how can i go get some abilities even saying  

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:37.040
god has to write all these things for me how can 
i sing against my god and he flees and his cloak

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.880
these things are around us based upon 
joseph's story we should believe we should run  

00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.080
and then that's that's the challenge what's the 
answer the answer is to run from these things  

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:06.080
flee from them don't hang around this is the 
thought like joseph didn't hang around and  

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:13.280
like let's talk through this you know he he 
got away from him because guys we apart from  

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.640
jesus coming back we're always 
going to have this war inside of us  

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:26.640
right to the desired sin and place in the wrong 
situation we will give over to that right so it's  

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:32.800
not even placing yourself in those situations and 
so when it comes to sin i was challenged with this  

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:38.480
thought a long time ago because we don't just say 
notice him we say yes to jesus because think about  

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:44.640
this when you're saying no no no what are you 
doing you're thinking but if you'll say no to sin  

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:50.320
and you start saying yes to jesus yes jesus you're 
renewing your mind to consistently think of jesus  

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:56.640
in his pure ways and his more valuable ways in the 
context of the relationships that god's given you  

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:03.200
so say yes over and over again place yourself in 
opportunities and renew your mind with this word  

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:12.640
that says yes to these positive things so how 
do we kind of summarize this today so we learn  

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:19.120
as imitators of jesus we should watch how we walk 
and watch how we talk right and i think those two  

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:25.120
things prove the reality of our faith in jesus 
and no this is not a work salvation because i  

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:30.320
think a lot of times it's like well if i do these 
two things then i'm safe right but it's a response  

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:38.720
it's a response to what christ has done for us 
not what gets a salvation it's a response from  

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:44.000
one guy so that's why he says therefore because 
of what christ has done for us we walk these ways  

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.240
so know that i'm not saying that this is a work's 
salvation right but practically speaking how do we  

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.040
fight these things so i'm gonna give you a couple 
of things number one don't conceal it confess it  

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.520
if there's sin in your life and maybe you know you 
heard this list today maybe something in there is  

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.360
applying to you right maybe it's something you're 
viewing maybe it's something you're thinking maybe  

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:12.960
it's the way you're talking whatever it is confess 
to god here's my challenge to find somebody  

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:20.000
that you can trust to confess it out loud to 
why there's accountability in it and if you'll  

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.680
find somebody that's in this room or back there 
starting in children's ministry maybe somebody  

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.320
another christian that you respect they're not 
going to condemn you they're going to wrap their  

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.040
arm around you and say i'm proud of you because 
of your your willingness to invest something  

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:38.240
that may be dark but your willingness to want to 
overcome it right you want us to overcome it so  

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:45.600
don't conceal it confess it james 5 16 says this 
therefore confess your sins to one another and  

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.960
pray for one another so that you may be healed the 
prayer of a righteous person is very powerful and  

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.600
it's an effect so again we look at this verse and 
i'm i've actually quoted this verse multiple times  

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.320
the prayer of a righteous verse is very powerful 
in its effect and i believe that wholeheartedly  

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:05.520
but let's look at the context of this it's in 
the context of confessing sin to one another  

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:10.800
so that you may be healed so if we have 
to be healed he's not talking about  

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:17.360
swords on our arm he's talking about 
the swords in our heart and our soul  

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:26.960
the sin that entangling you may is 
some of these you're injured and prayer  

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:36.240
confession to other believers into god can 
heal you that's exactly what that scripture  

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.000
and so we need to heal from our guilt and 
that's one of the things too i'm telling you sin  

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.880
wants to drive you down and say you're 
worthless but god says you're worth  

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.880
so much to me that he gave his 
life for you so don't let that  

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:55.360
run in your mind so here's another one so don't 
conceal it confess it don't fight it flee from it  

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.280
so you heard me say earlier i thought this was 
interesting as i was kind of writing this and i  

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:05.680
was kind of walking through this we were fighting 
for purity in our marriages and our singleness  

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.480
but in this idea here it says don't 
fight it flee from it it is this idea of  

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.680
and then how does this happen let's 
throw some things out there for you  

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.920
if you're struggling with alcohol and sit in 
your fridge what do you think that's going to  

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.000
do it's going to cause you to go there any time 
that you're struggling with something right to  

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.720
find sooner than that so here's 
another one i'm going to step out there  

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.280
when it comes to your phone or your computer don't 
leave it wide open where you can do anything you  

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:41.360
want to do put something on there put people 
accountable asking you what you're feeling right  

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.480
not because you're this horrible person but 
because you want it to be protected you want  

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.960
to protect your rights so we are going to 
not fight it right we're not going to fight  

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:58.400
it or we're going to flee from it we're trying to 
flee and i love this statement i heard yesterday  

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:03.680
and it just challenged me i had to write this in 
why resist the temptation in the future when you  

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:10.080
can eliminate it today i want to say that again 
why resist a temptation in the future when you can  

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.400
eliminate today so this is where i say you may be 
hearing everything you're hearing today and saying  

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.800
we don't struggle with that we don't have problems 
with our marriage we're gonna have problems with  

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:23.360
you anything we're gonna talk anything what are 
you doing to place now to prevent future issues  

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.800
and these are even things for me and you guys 
have this i i've been said so like i don't  

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.000
meet individually with women but there's times 
i'm texting some of you guys individually and  

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.600
i'm like i've got to get back to texting you 
guys with your husband or with bernie in the  

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.080
text messages why not because i think anything in 
pure is going to happen in there really i don't  

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:45.360
but i'm protecting myself i'm protecting 
you well that sounds foolish no it's saying  

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:50.800
that i love my wife and my relationship with 
jesus and my walk as a pastor as a christian  

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.920
more over who would condemn me for wanting to do 
that there's more to there's more of that purity  

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.760
when it comes to outside sexual issues when it 
comes to sin any other sin that we're dealing with  

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.920
again i'm gonna say this why is 
this temptation in the future  

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:11.760
today i i challenge you to really internalize 
that what that means for you um and so let me  

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.080
just kind of just just close it this way again i 
don't know what you're struggling with maybe it's  

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:22.320
sexual immorality impurity maybe it's greed right 
maybe it's some of this obscene or foolish talking  

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:29.680
today's the day i've been there before i 
sat and seen and i'm like next week tomorrow

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.520
or i just i can't just because i'm going to 
ignore it but today's the day you deal with  

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.720
it right don't let the sunset before we deal with 
it place accountability in your life to prevent  

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.600
those opportunities in the future it doesn't 
matter how strong you are today we have those  

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:50.960
moments of weakness that destroy our future and 
i think of david right david was a man for god's  

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:58.000
own heart and there was no accountability to 
what happened and not only the child's life  

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.440
was taken but even his kingdom was 
taken and placed in the son's hands  

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.360
there's major consequences to adding in 
accountability and we can prevent those right so  

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.600
here's my encouragement during invitation i just 
encourage you to go to god and ask for forgiveness  

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.880
for anything that comes to mind over these things 
or other things i i pray that you ask god for  

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.600
accountability you know your person's coming into 
your life to bring accountability in those areas

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:29.360
go to god and surrender again you you 
may heard the sentences today i'm sure  

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.880
none of those but there's something that god's 
placed on your heart that you need to address

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.560
and i think that's the struggle sometimes as we 
look at this oh are you judging me absolutely  

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:57.040
not neither is paul he's just not beneficial for 
you so you can't defeat this alone don't conceal  

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:07.120
it confess it don't fight it flee from him come to 
jesus he is grace abounds more and more i'll i'll  

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:12.720
say one more thing if you're sitting here listen 
to this and you're idolizing new things and maybe  

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.840
you're questioning do i have a true relationship 
with jesus have i given my life to jesus

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:22.160
you know you can know today there's 
so many conversations that i've had  

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.600
in membership meetings where a person 
says i want to go back and i want to  

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.320
i think i was saved at 13 i think i was saved 
at 17 but i really wrestled with these things  

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.840
here and there and they're like trying to justify 
their salvation at these ages and i'm like that's  

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.320
great if you want to if that's what you feel 
like you're saved in i'm not questioning that  

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.520
but why question something when today you know 
and complain today as your salvation you cannot  

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:48.640
wonder anymore and today is the day of salvation 
and you walk in freedom and not question it  

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:54.960
that's offered to you that if you're struggling 
with that there's no reason to try to justify  

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.920
something that may have not been there or maybe 
it has who's gonna criticize you here nobody we're  

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:05.120
gonna celebrate that it's one step closer to jesus 
that you want to prioritize today's day so if you  

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.520
don't know jesus and you want to know jesus come 
talk to me after service don't let another day  

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:22.480
pass by and you say okay maybe let it be today 
let it be today so let's pray lord jesus um today  

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:29.360
lord as we open up this text lord i know there's 
some uncomfortableness in it even as a pastor  

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:36.480
to walk through this or because it begins to 
really look at the depths of our heart and maybe  

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:44.880
really lay open our hearts forward to a point 
where we see some errors in our ways and the ways  

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:52.320
that we think or we talk or we we act and lord 
today is all about healing it's all about healing  

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.520
but we can overcome these things because you 
have conquered them by your death on the cross  

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:04.240
and resurrection back to life lord i pray that 
we lay down every sin that so easily entangles us  

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.320
and lord we pick up our cross daily and 
we follow you and lord as we follow you  

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.840
when we are free from these sins lord it will be 
amazing how we can run the race that you called us

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:24.320
thank you so much for the therefore 
because therefore you did so much for us  

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:34.560
and that is why we strive to walk in love and 
imitate you help us address anything more that we  

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.560
have sinned against you or someone else may we 
confess that lord knowing that you are really  

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:49.840
given us freedom from it that's the lord we just 
pray all this and your heavenly name jesus amen
