00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.410
Go ahead and jump in.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.780
Uh, today's text.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.180
If you wanna turn with
me, we'll be in acts two.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.860
Uh, we're gonna be reading
versus 30 th 37 through 47.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.090
Uh, we'll spend the majority of our time
in versus 42 through 47, but we'll be

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.930
reading acts chapter 2 37 through 47.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.165
Um, so last week we discussed,
um, The first part of our series.

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:30.765
So our series is talking about next
steps and one of the things, uh,

00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:33.915
because obviously I'm consistently
see each and every week, we have

00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:36.885
different people in and out that
I'm gonna send these messages out.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.125
So, um, to those who aren't here,
and if you weren't here last

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:42.525
week, my encouragement is to go
listen to last week's message.

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:46.665
But in this next step series, we're
really walking through as a church.

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:48.825
Um, our strategy, right?

00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:50.295
We've been talking about
our mission, right?

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:51.705
Our mission is to inspire.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.200
By helping people discover God's
purpose for their life, through

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.490
a relationship with Jesus.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.900
We truly believe that the greatest way
that we can help people do that is by

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.940
following Jesus, living in community.

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:06.330
Serving those around us and
expanding God's kingdom.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.550
Um, and so that's kind of what
we've been walking through.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.960
So last week was following Jesus and, uh,
Britt has been serving in kids last week

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.830
and this week, and she listened to my
message and she said, well, here's a good

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.360
thing about your message this last week.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.490
She said, you, you said
the name of Jesus a lot.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.150
And I said, well, praise God, if I
got something right, I did say that.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.820
So, um, that is who we are as a church.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.970
And I would tell people, this
is, um, we are unashamed.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.590
In, in our, our thoughts and our
conversations and what we talk

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.480
about that Jesus changes our life,
that everything we do flows out

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.620
of that relationship with Jesus.

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:44.880
And that that's exactly why our
strategy is to follow Jesus.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.100
And that sounds so simple yet.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.960
So complicated all in the same sentence.

00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:53.175
That's why we're here during
this series to talk about why

00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:54.315
is it important to follow Jesus?

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:56.265
What does that step,
what does that look like?

00:01:56.265 --> 00:01:59.325
And we talked about that last week,
but we get to talk about what I call

00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:05.865
as the next step after following Jesus,
which we see the new believers in acts

00:02:05.865 --> 00:02:09.824
and how they responded, what their
next step was after following Jesus.

00:02:09.884 --> 00:02:11.715
So we're gonna kind of jump into that.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:14.894
And that is really when we
talk about living in community.

00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:16.304
Living in community.

00:02:16.484 --> 00:02:20.415
And so I went out and looked at Webster's
dictionary and it defines community

00:02:20.984 --> 00:02:27.075
as a unified body of individuals, such
as a group of people with a common

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.424
characteristic or interest living
together within a larger society.

00:02:31.424 --> 00:02:35.475
So I'm gonna say that again, a unified
body of individuals, such as a group of

00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:40.815
people with a common characteristic or
interest living together in a larger.

00:02:42.285 --> 00:02:45.915
In just looking in that, I
think we can see obviously the

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.924
idea behind community, right?

00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:53.265
A group of people that have common
interests and, and usually it's a, a

00:02:53.265 --> 00:02:55.185
group living within a larger group.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:59.265
And we at inspiring hope talk
about the idea of living in

00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:01.635
community as our inspired groups.

00:03:01.635 --> 00:03:04.605
We have inspire groups during the week
and we took off during the summer, but

00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:05.595
we're getting ready to start those back.

00:03:06.614 --> 00:03:09.825
And something that I lay to each one
of your seats somewhere around there.

00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:12.915
Um, and again, I'm gonna give this out
to everybody else that wasn't here today.

00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:16.185
Um, but these cards are an
opportunity for you to fill out.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.560
What night of the week might
be good for you to be able to

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.850
be a part of an inspire group.

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.870
And so what I do know is that it is
difficult to find a night for everybody.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.090
And so we are not necessarily
saying, Hey, if you mark down that

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.310
we're gonna create an inspire group
for you every night of the week.

00:03:29.315 --> 00:03:32.730
But what we're saying is we'd like to
know number one, if you could attend

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:35.640
an inspire group, which I would say
this, most of us could, if we could

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.260
choose the night or day in time.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.589
Right.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.140
So choose a couple of days and options.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.730
And then that lets us know.

00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:45.585
One you're interest in the groups, but
two, the nights that you can do it,

00:03:45.585 --> 00:03:48.765
and then we're gonna see what we can do
to either have a group on that night.

00:03:48.765 --> 00:03:51.495
And if we can't, we're still going
to talk about how to waste, to

00:03:51.495 --> 00:03:53.025
connect with you on those nights.

00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:58.395
Um, but anyways, as we look at how
important community is one of the cool

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.535
parts about Jesus, and this is what I
would say, like when I go and study God's

00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:04.305
word, I go and see, what did Jesus do?

00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:05.715
Well, Jesus lived in community.

00:04:05.985 --> 00:04:07.935
See, after he started his
ministry, the first thing.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.880
All right, we'll wait a minute and see
if we can get everything rebooted back.

00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:40.755
I don't know.

00:04:41.055 --> 00:04:42.165
Should I even go on?

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:46.875
let there be light there.

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:49.815
It is in the beginning and I didn't
start early enough in creation.

00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:50.505
Yes.

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:53.745
Now we didn't do that.

00:04:53.745 --> 00:04:53.895
Okay.

00:04:56.655 --> 00:04:56.895
Okay.

00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:00.735
So Jason, do we have sound again?

00:05:00.795 --> 00:05:01.155
Are we.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.850
At least got sound.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.330
I know that video's probably loading
back up and that may take a few minutes.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.530
You're good on video too.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.920
Okay.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.750
We're good on sound cuz
I don't hear anything.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.830
So that's the only thing I was gonna say.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.200
You got anything?

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.620
There we go.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.100
Hello?

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.550
Okay.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.480
We are back.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.980
All right.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.700
Live in action.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.390
Where we go here.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.950
So Jesus, after.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.440
He started his ministry, right?

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.239
He was baptized.

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:32.310
He was, um, tested for 40 days.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.099
He came back and last week we saw rather
than doing ministry alone, he said,

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.229
let me go gather a community of people.

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:46.109
And so he began to invite these men to
follow him in this community, to go be

00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:50.340
a part of this awesome mission that each
one of us have been called to, right.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.500
To expand the gospel, to let people
know the love of Jesus around the world.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.260
So Jesus obviously had community.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.820
The only time you saw Jesus out
of community was when he was going

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.320
away to spend time with his father.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.920
Right?

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.040
And so this is what we could say is,
so the only reason why we could justify

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.190
ourselves being away from community is
if we're alone with the father, right.

00:06:11.195 --> 00:06:14.640
We're alone with Jesus, and we're growing
our personal relationship with Christ.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.700
But outside of that, he was
consistently in community.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.540
And we see even in the new Testament, that
same thing in the book of acts and so on.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.810
And so.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.110
I think when we look at this, that Jesus
taught us that we are better together.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.220
We're stronger together where it's
an essential part of following

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.230
Jesus' living in community together.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.070
And I look at this as Sundays
as one of those opportunities.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.550
And we'll learn more about that today,
but really we would look at that it's

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.530
every day we have that opportunity.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.950
Um, and so, uh, I wanted
to ask this question.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.330
I love asking questions to you.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.030
Why, what is the benefit.

00:06:51.284 --> 00:06:52.905
Of living in community with other people.

00:06:52.905 --> 00:06:53.715
What's the benefit

00:06:56.925 --> 00:06:57.585
support.

00:06:57.645 --> 00:06:58.335
What else?

00:07:04.275 --> 00:07:07.605
What's the benefit of living
in community with other people?

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:10.965
Accountability?

00:07:11.385 --> 00:07:11.895
What else?

00:07:15.405 --> 00:07:16.995
Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:17.475 --> 00:07:17.805
What else?

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.979
Anything else fun.

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:26.489
Yeah.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.289
The hangout have fun, right?

00:07:28.294 --> 00:07:32.400
Friendship, um, encouragement,
spiritual growth and learning.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.679
So as, as we begin to think about
this, cuz I do things every day

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:41.460
because I see value in them and
the things I don't do every day are

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.200
the things I don't see value in.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.500
So at some point, when we look
at this idea behind community

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.539
or living in community together,
It'll never be a part of our life.

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:57.030
It'll never be an important part of our
life until we see how valuable it is.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.390
And so this is where we're gonna continue
to build off this idea that God has

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.000
designed us for community, not isolation.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.659
And that's why we look at, even in the
beginning, when he created Adam, he says,

00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:08.130
it wasn't good for Adam to be alone.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:08.310
Right.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.570
And that's where he created Eve.

00:08:10.049 --> 00:08:12.090
But even bigger than
this is the cool part.

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:17.340
When God sent Jesus to save us from our
sins, he created the body of Christ.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:18.990
You all know this, right?

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.410
We, we can't just function with
one part of our body working.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:28.860
The body works together best when
we're working together in community.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.320
And I go back to that definition.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.150
I know I haven't started
really in the text yet.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:33.299
Right.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:34.560
But I wanna set this up.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.610
Going back to that definition.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.919
It's a unified body of individuals.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:38.880
This is a community, right?

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.210
A unified body of individuals,
such as a group of people with a

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.330
common characteristic or interest
living together within a larger.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:51.930
So the idea behind community is, and
the body of Christ is that we work

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.230
best functioning and living together.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:00.180
And that's exactly why God
created this idea behind community

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.170
and the body of Christ and how
important it is for each one of us.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.890
Um, and I wanna just, I just, just
wanna think back to this before we jump

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.390
into this text, how critical to me,
when I started thinking about living

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.370
community, that piece has been in my.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.950
I believe I am who I am today because
of the communities that I've been a

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.220
part of whenever I first gave my life
to Christ the church that we were

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.610
going to, we started going to, um,
we called it small groups on Sunday

00:09:26.615 --> 00:09:30.120
morning and we went to a young Marriot's
class and that was a class where me

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.890
and Britney really grew in our faith.

00:09:31.895 --> 00:09:33.030
And we were really challenged.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.780
And out of that, we went with another,
uh, couple and we started a group.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.340
And out of that, we started another group.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.020
And out of that, we started
another group and we started

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.320
one more group before we moved.

00:09:42.445 --> 00:09:43.125
It's so cool.

00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:43.755
Those communities.

00:09:43.755 --> 00:09:44.955
I begin to think about that.

00:09:44.955 --> 00:09:49.575
We were a part of not only were me and
Britney, so impacted, and I am the person

00:09:49.575 --> 00:09:53.955
I am today, but I begin to realize the
people that I was able to impact and meet,

00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:58.125
like those stories will be with me forever
because those communities change me.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.055
So whenever I look at this, and I
really wanna challenge those of you

00:10:02.055 --> 00:10:05.205
that are here, tho those of you who
end up seeing this video when I send it

00:10:05.205 --> 00:10:10.905
to you, cuz I believe the strength of
inspiring hope going forward will be.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:16.110
The devotion that we put in living
in community together outside of

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.400
Sunday mornings, doing life together,
encouraging one another believing in

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.560
one another, supporting one another.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.660
That is where the strength will happen.

00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:26.700
And we're gonna see that
today in today's text.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.020
We're gonna see how they model what
living in community looks like.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.340
So we're gonna jump into this again.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.810
And this starts in verse 37 and all
the way down to 47 in acts chapter two.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.390
And I'll kind of catch
you up a little bit here.

00:10:39.395 --> 00:10:44.550
What what's happened is, is, um,
Peter and the apostles had waited,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.930
you know, for the holy spirit to come.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.230
The holy spirit came and they went out
and they began to preach the gospel.

00:10:49.995 --> 00:10:52.545
All these people came to
faith in Christ over 3000 were

00:10:52.545 --> 00:10:53.564
coming to faith into Christ.

00:10:53.564 --> 00:10:56.175
And this is the, the point in which
they're coming to faith in Christ.

00:10:56.175 --> 00:10:58.965
They had shared the gospel
and it picks up in verse 37.

00:10:58.965 --> 00:11:04.035
It says when they heard this,
they were pierced to the heart and

00:11:04.035 --> 00:11:08.385
said to Peter and the rest of the
apostles brothers, what should we do?

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:13.635
Peter replied, repent and be baptized
each one of you and the name of Jesus

00:11:13.635 --> 00:11:15.435
Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.

00:11:15.855 --> 00:11:19.815
And you'll receive the gift of the,
of the holy spirit for the promise

00:11:19.815 --> 00:11:22.005
is for you and your children.

00:11:22.275 --> 00:11:26.805
And for all those who are far off, as
many as the Lord are, God will call.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.780
With many other words, he testified
strongly and urged them saying, be saved

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:36.640
from this corrupt generation so that
who accepted this message were baptized.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.580
And that day about 3000
people were added to them.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.420
And then it says that they
devoted themselves to the apostles

00:11:43.425 --> 00:11:47.560
teaching to the fellowship, to the
breaking of bread, into prayer.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.839
Everyone was filled with all and
many wonders and signs were being

00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:53.699
performed through the apostles.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.329
Now, all the believers were together
and held all things in common.

00:11:57.569 --> 00:12:01.439
They sold their possessions and
property and distributed, proceeds

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.410
to the, to all as any had need.

00:12:04.979 --> 00:12:08.250
Every day, they devoted themselves
to meeting together in the temple

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.699
and breaking bread from house to
house that ate their food with

00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:15.870
joyful and sincere hearts, praising
God and enjoying the favor of all.

00:12:17.125 --> 00:12:18.915
Every day, the Lord added to their.

00:12:19.694 --> 00:12:21.255
Those who are being save.

00:12:21.465 --> 00:12:23.895
Let's take a moment to pray, Lord Jesus.

00:12:23.895 --> 00:12:25.995
We just pray Lord that
our hearts are open today.

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:29.775
My Lord mind included, um,
that we see the value Lord.

00:12:29.775 --> 00:12:32.655
We see the opportunity
we have in community.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:37.365
We see Lord that it is a next step
that every one of us is being invited

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.665
in to take and to make priority in
our life because it is valuable not

00:12:40.665 --> 00:12:43.035
only for us, but for those around us.

00:12:43.365 --> 00:12:47.085
Lord, I pray that you continue to walk
with us as a church, as we begin to

00:12:47.295 --> 00:12:48.975
continue to take next steps, Lord.

00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:53.550
And I pray that we continue to see
life change, um, and Lord that we

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.859
will continue to give you praise
because of that life change.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.990
And so Lord, you just pray
this in your heaven name.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:05.640
So we see here as we, we kind of almost
even, uh, look at the, the first couple

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.060
of verses there, 37 through, uh, 41.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.630
We see obviously them
responding to the gospel.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.470
These 3000 people respond to the gospel
and I begin to look at that's the

00:13:16.475 --> 00:13:18.480
moment they begin to take next steps.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:24.630
These people heard the gospel and they
repented, they were baptized and they

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.920
received the spirit of God inside.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.630
But they didn't stop there.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:27.840
Right?

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.920
Those were next steps.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.060
They were pined of their sins.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.050
They were baptized.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.890
They received the spirit of God to
live inside them and they didn't stop.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.790
They, they continued to, to take
next steps by living in community.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.070
So what does community look like?

00:13:41.075 --> 00:13:44.520
And I believe this text clearly tells us
what community looks like is devotion.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:51.540
He says this in verse 42 and 46, that
they devoted themselves to these things.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.569
And I even wouldn't look at
another word other than devotion

00:13:54.575 --> 00:13:56.640
is they dedicated themselves.

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.250
They committed themselves to these things.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.640
And if you would even see here
most of the time it was daily,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.470
it wasn't a one time thing.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.350
It wasn't a occasional,
it was a daily act.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.600
And so whenever I started looking
at this, I started saying, okay,

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.990
the first step of obedience
outside of salvation and baptism.

00:14:14.865 --> 00:14:16.095
Was to live in community.

00:14:16.695 --> 00:14:20.085
If you wanna know why as a church,
we've set that up as a strategy to

00:14:20.085 --> 00:14:21.555
follow Jesus and live in community.

00:14:21.555 --> 00:14:24.375
We believe that's the
way the church started.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.060
It was a good way to start and we should
continue that way as a church is to,

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.460
to prioritize community after faith.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.470
And so that's why we talk
about living in community.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:39.780
So let's see what they devoted themselves
to and how that applies to us as well.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.870
So these new followers of Jesus
devoted and dedicated themselves

00:14:42.875 --> 00:14:45.720
to the apostles teaching well,
just so you know, there's no more

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.490
apostles other than the word of God.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:47.970
Right?

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.500
So they're devoted to that.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.570
They're devoted to what
I would even say this.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.350
Why is.

00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:55.905
Because they were new in their faith.

00:14:55.964 --> 00:14:59.864
They knew, Hey, we don't really fully
understand all this, so we're gonna

00:14:59.864 --> 00:15:01.814
devote ourselves to wise teaching.

00:15:02.175 --> 00:15:04.334
And so that's really what we see
here when they devoted themselves

00:15:04.334 --> 00:15:05.324
to the apostles teaching.

00:15:05.745 --> 00:15:06.675
Here's the part I love.

00:15:06.675 --> 00:15:10.724
I've, I've read it in different versions,
but in the CSB, here's what it says.

00:15:10.724 --> 00:15:15.584
It says they devoted themselves to the
apostles teaching and two the fellowship.

00:15:16.005 --> 00:15:19.905
And I stopped because the, initially
when I look at this, this is what I.

00:15:20.609 --> 00:15:22.349
They devote themselves to fellowship.

00:15:22.439 --> 00:15:23.969
And I believe that's a part of it, right.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.689
Fellowship, which means is the, the
hanging out and the part of the breaking

00:15:27.689 --> 00:15:29.609
of bread and, and doing life together.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:29.849
Right.

00:15:29.854 --> 00:15:33.540
That's the first part that most of us
think of, but this is the part that

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.099
I really want us to think through.

00:15:35.099 --> 00:15:39.170
And I want us to be challenged, to think
they devoted themselves to the fellowship.

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:43.689
Well, the fellowship means they
were dedicated themselves to one.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:45.584
right.

00:15:45.855 --> 00:15:49.334
And I think that's a different
picture guys, because to, to

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.595
dedicate myself, to just attending a
community group or an inspire group

00:15:53.595 --> 00:15:55.425
and hanging out is a good thing.

00:15:55.425 --> 00:15:56.985
And I believe that's the
part that they're saying they

00:15:56.985 --> 00:15:58.485
dedicated themselves to that too.

00:15:59.115 --> 00:16:03.314
But when they dedicated to themselves
to one another, that was like a marriage

00:16:03.735 --> 00:16:09.495
that was like a, a union that God
designed the body to put together.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.560
So I see this as such an important part.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.050
They dedicated themselves to one another.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.469
And I remember making this
statement in Brockington.

00:16:19.475 --> 00:16:20.219
You may remember this.

00:16:20.219 --> 00:16:22.439
I remember the group that we
had with Nathan and Christine.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.689
I would make this statement
pretty consistently when I get

00:16:24.689 --> 00:16:25.980
the opportunity to teach in there.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.939
What if your attendance in this
community group, this small group,

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.250
wasn't just here to change your life,
but somebody else's by you being here,

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.630
you're encouraging somebody else.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:37.469
And for me, most of the.

00:16:38.325 --> 00:16:41.745
Brock and Jenna's presence encouraged
me because they cared enough to come.

00:16:41.745 --> 00:16:43.755
They saw it as valuable, right?

00:16:43.755 --> 00:16:49.095
So like when we are dedicated to
each other in fellowship, like

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:54.175
there's a relationship there, guys
that is strong, that is valuable

00:16:54.255 --> 00:16:56.805
that God has designed us for.

00:16:57.495 --> 00:17:01.875
And so I love that picture, that we're
dedicated to one another, because what

00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:06.525
if your involvement in inspire group
is what changes someone else's lives?

00:17:07.185 --> 00:17:09.194
Here's let me just, let me
challenge you with this.

00:17:09.405 --> 00:17:13.155
Your dedication to those
things will change.

00:17:13.155 --> 00:17:15.224
Someone's else's life yours, right?

00:17:15.224 --> 00:17:19.064
Because you're there, but there's someone
there that needs your encouragement,

00:17:19.185 --> 00:17:21.944
your dedication to them to care.

00:17:22.665 --> 00:17:25.125
And I, my, my challenge is, and
we're gonna continue to talk

00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:26.504
about this with inspire groups.

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:30.495
And as those who lead out new inspire
groups is that we create communities

00:17:31.064 --> 00:17:34.125
that it's just not the leaders'
responsibility to be dedicated to the.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.850
And like checking in on him and investing,
but it's the group's responsibility

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.890
to, to take care of one another.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.080
And even those what
I'll just even say this.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.860
So, you know, what, if my schedule
doesn't match up with an inspire group,

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.640
if your schedule doesn't match up with
an inspire group, you're still going

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.870
to be a part of an inspire group.

00:17:51.875 --> 00:17:56.040
You may not get to 10 attend, but those
people will have you as part of their

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.990
group, they will connect themselves.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.380
They will dedicate themselves
to you as a group to invest in.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.160
You pray for you.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.670
Encourage.

00:18:03.255 --> 00:18:05.475
Because that's the church we wanna be.

00:18:05.505 --> 00:18:08.775
We wanna be just like the
church that started here.

00:18:09.525 --> 00:18:12.615
So we, as they continue on, it says that
they were devoted to breaking bread.

00:18:12.675 --> 00:18:14.445
Everybody loves eating food.

00:18:14.955 --> 00:18:17.715
So why wouldn't you dedicate
yourself to that while you meet?

00:18:17.835 --> 00:18:18.645
We love food.

00:18:18.885 --> 00:18:19.785
That's why we eat.

00:18:20.055 --> 00:18:26.985
But I would even say this, some of the
most funny things happen over a mill.

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.125
I like laughing.

00:18:28.125 --> 00:18:29.295
I, I like hanging.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.300
I would even say this, a lot of
the mills I've even had since we've

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.790
been here at inspiring hope have
been some of the coolest meals,

00:18:35.795 --> 00:18:39.840
because a lot of times those mills
were part of me, inviting people to

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.400
come be a part of inspiring hope.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:41.880
Right.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.640
Like we're gonna hang out and we're
gonna talk about some cool things.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.700
So I love, that's why we have
lunch with, you know, lunch, right.

00:18:47.705 --> 00:18:50.070
When we have the next steps
lunch it's because it's just

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.880
cool to hang out with food.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.940
So I think we're just being godly
when we break bread together.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:54.360
Okay.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.860
Then most even believe this,
that at the end of those mills,

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.190
that they would celebrate a
communion, um, with that as well.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:06.150
And so it even talks to the idea
behind having communion together.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.670
Um, and then it says
this, he talks about that.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.980
They were dedicated themselves to prayer.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:16.920
So prayer for one another, and this
is truly a place to be vulnerable and

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.600
to share what's going on in our lives.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.200
And I would even say this, this is
something that I want to continue to teach

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.030
myself and I wanna continue to teach our.

00:19:25.305 --> 00:19:29.295
We undervalue the power and
the importance of prayer.

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:33.615
It was an essential part in these
new believers' lives, right?

00:19:33.615 --> 00:19:36.945
To teaching, to fellowship, to
breaking a bread into prayer.

00:19:36.945 --> 00:19:38.205
It was a key part.

00:19:38.715 --> 00:19:41.355
And I think many times
this is just being me.

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:44.985
I don't mention prayer request because
I feel embarrassed by some of the

00:19:44.985 --> 00:19:49.635
things I want you to pray for me about,
or I don't even mention our prayer

00:19:49.635 --> 00:19:52.195
request because I'm not trusting God.

00:19:53.085 --> 00:19:54.945
Enough in the areas to even have one.

00:19:55.064 --> 00:19:55.754
I don't have one.

00:19:56.205 --> 00:19:57.945
I'm not prayer request cuz
I've got it all figured out.

00:19:57.945 --> 00:19:58.544
I'm good.

00:19:59.085 --> 00:20:01.574
So it's like, to me, I
think that's part of this.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.145
As we look at living in community
together, we need to dedicate ourselves

00:20:05.145 --> 00:20:09.885
to prayer and the more idea behind
the purpose of prayer to be more like

00:20:09.889 --> 00:20:13.875
God, to be able to be vulnerable with
one another and to encourage one.

00:20:14.865 --> 00:20:19.365
So we see that just in those, that
first ver first of verse 42 here, but

00:20:19.365 --> 00:20:21.885
let's just continue on cuz it goes down
and I'm, I'm gonna kind of split this

00:20:21.885 --> 00:20:26.504
up into section of 46 and he says, and
every day they devoted themselves, right?

00:20:26.504 --> 00:20:30.794
So they continue to devote themselves
and dedicate themselves to doing what

00:20:31.094 --> 00:20:34.574
it says that they devoted themselves
to meeting together in the temple.

00:20:35.504 --> 00:20:40.544
So this is just, again, if you think
about the temple pre Jesus, the temple was

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.004
the place where the presence of God was.

00:20:44.715 --> 00:20:46.635
I started thinking, well, they
don't need to go to the temple

00:20:46.635 --> 00:20:49.185
anymore because the presence of
God doesn't hang out there anymore.

00:20:49.845 --> 00:20:52.125
But then I kind of laughed
and corrected myself.

00:20:53.445 --> 00:20:57.405
When we come to the temple, a
place of gathering the presence of

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:58.695
God is there because we're there.

00:20:59.715 --> 00:21:03.585
So why would we, you know, look
at this and go, well, you know,

00:21:03.615 --> 00:21:06.465
they don't need the temple that
Christ lives inside of them.

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:09.375
They're saying we needed a big
enough place to hang out with each.

00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:11.715
So they needed the big community.

00:21:11.715 --> 00:21:12.555
That's why you hear us.

00:21:12.675 --> 00:21:14.175
Like we have Sunday mornings.

00:21:14.175 --> 00:21:15.045
Why do we have Sunday mornings?

00:21:15.045 --> 00:21:17.145
And I know you're looking at 'em,
this isn't much of a big community.

00:21:17.265 --> 00:21:19.335
It's a bigger community than
what you would normally see

00:21:19.335 --> 00:21:20.235
in an inspire group, right?

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.435
When we have everybody here.

00:21:21.765 --> 00:21:24.675
So that bigger community is to come
together, to meet together and see

00:21:24.675 --> 00:21:28.695
the whole church to encourage the
whole church, to, to gather and

00:21:28.695 --> 00:21:31.245
learn in God's word, into praise.

00:21:31.245 --> 00:21:31.575
Right?

00:21:31.575 --> 00:21:34.635
So they were dedicated to
that same thing as we are, as.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.970
Then they were also dedicated
to meeting house to house.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.100
This is where we talk
about community, right?

00:21:41.129 --> 00:21:43.590
This is the community that we're
saying doing life together.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.740
When you meet in somebody's home, I
look at it at two different places.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.889
I I've had groups at the church
and I've had groups in my home.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.510
Groups at the church are great, but I
don't feel like that there is comfortable

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:59.520
and as relaxed and as inviting as a
home is home is where family comes.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.690
I would say this, this is a challenge
that, that I have been reminded of.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.380
Even recently, that when we
invite people under a home, we've

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.090
given them refrigerator rights.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.720
You know, what a refrigerator rights are
that they can walk in, they can open your

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.130
refrigerator and take anything out of it.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.310
And you're not gonna go, what are you.

00:22:16.375 --> 00:22:16.470
right.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:20.790
It's that, it's that moment where
they're family that you have as we go

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:29.790
back to, as you have dedicated yourself
to one another they're as, as have as

00:22:29.795 --> 00:22:31.350
much access as you do to your home.

00:22:31.965 --> 00:22:36.375
And that's the type of life that
these people after they had just,

00:22:36.675 --> 00:22:37.965
this is the beginning of the church.

00:22:37.965 --> 00:22:41.264
Y'all this is whenever the spirit
of God begin to in dwell on people

00:22:41.534 --> 00:22:43.034
and people begin to get to saved.

00:22:43.245 --> 00:22:47.324
They dead educated themselves
to living in community together.

00:22:48.225 --> 00:22:51.014
That's what God has called us to do.

00:22:52.095 --> 00:22:56.265
That's why we need to continue to
find ways to do that as a church

00:22:56.415 --> 00:22:58.155
and to follow after these examples.

00:22:58.155 --> 00:22:59.205
And this is the cool part.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:03.045
I don't have to go out and
recreate this it's right here.

00:23:03.765 --> 00:23:05.715
The, the apostles are
speaking to me right now.

00:23:05.715 --> 00:23:09.405
They're speaking to you right now
to tell us how to do life, how

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:11.325
to live as followers of Jesus.

00:23:11.415 --> 00:23:17.025
Not because we have to, this is the cool
part is because they devoted them devoted,

00:23:17.145 --> 00:23:19.095
devoted themselves to these things.

00:23:20.415 --> 00:23:24.195
There was a natural
outflow of this, right?

00:23:24.195 --> 00:23:25.575
Let me, let me, let me talk about this.

00:23:25.754 --> 00:23:29.205
The result of dedicating themselves to
this is these next couple of verses.

00:23:29.445 --> 00:23:33.254
The overflow of living in community
is versus 43 through 45 and a

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.145
couple of things in 46 and 47.

00:23:35.145 --> 00:23:36.555
So 43 says this.

00:23:37.065 --> 00:23:42.555
It says everyone was filled with
all and many wanders and signs were

00:23:42.555 --> 00:23:44.655
being performed through the Aus.

00:23:45.825 --> 00:23:46.725
I look at this way.

00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:50.685
When we look at verse 43, because
they de dedicated and devoted

00:23:50.685 --> 00:23:55.995
themselves to living in community,
these people were inspired by God.

00:23:56.565 --> 00:23:56.745
Right?

00:23:56.745 --> 00:24:00.105
We, I know he's sitting here saying
that they, the, the, uh, apostles

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.274
were doing wonders and signs.

00:24:01.274 --> 00:24:05.355
And at times I'll just tell you guys
this, when you live in community enough,

00:24:05.595 --> 00:24:07.935
you're gonna see God move in miraculous.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.550
These people were inspired by God.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.110
They were so transformed.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.220
They was drawing out of them.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.620
What they knew that they were
created for, which was community.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.840
They got to see God move.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.160
Right.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.370
And then we see in verse 44, it
says now all the believers were

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.110
together and held things in common.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:31.920
So out of the overflow of devotion to
community, these believers were unified.

00:24:32.865 --> 00:24:35.235
They were, it's says they
held all things in common.

00:24:35.235 --> 00:24:38.295
And this is where we'd say is they
didn't see their stuff as their own.

00:24:38.295 --> 00:24:40.125
They had refrigerator rights, right.

00:24:40.485 --> 00:24:42.045
Their stuff wasn't their own.

00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:43.245
They were theirs.

00:24:43.605 --> 00:24:47.085
Were the communities and the
unified, we talk a lot about

00:24:47.085 --> 00:24:49.815
this unified is not uniforming.

00:24:49.815 --> 00:24:51.675
It doesn't mean we all look the same.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.155
We all have the same tastes and all
the same emotions and all the same, you

00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:01.935
know what, but we are unified under what
Christ the transforming life of Jesus in

00:25:01.935 --> 00:25:04.725
our lives and flowing out of our lives.

00:25:05.025 --> 00:25:06.195
And so I, I go back.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.520
When we dedicate ourselves to these
things, living in community together,

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.370
there's a natural outflow from it.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.160
And I know you guys probably get
tired of my great examples of

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.630
this, but I love working out.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:19.410
I just do that.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:21.090
I'm the crazy person I love working out.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:25.820
But the result of dedicating myself
to working out produces the outflow

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.870
of strength and more endurance.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:29.850
And it's something that
fuels me and excites me.

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:30.330
I love it.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:31.050
I'm sorry I do.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.030
But I do that.

00:25:33.035 --> 00:25:34.980
Not because I just, you know, I love.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:38.970
But it's it's I actually
en enjoy those things.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.659
I dedicate myself to see the result,
cuz we, we dedicate ourselves.

00:25:42.659 --> 00:25:47.730
We devote ourselves to community, not
just for our benefit, but for the benefit

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:51.870
of the kingdom of God, for the benefit
to see other people experience the

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:53.939
transforming hope that you've experienced.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:58.889
So when we come back to this, every
one of us has an excuse, why we

00:25:58.889 --> 00:26:01.260
don't wanna live in community or why
we struggle to live in community.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.750
And it may be just so you know, I get it.

00:26:04.169 --> 00:26:07.679
It may be because your schedule's a lot
like mine, I don't really know much of an

00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:12.450
evening right now that I have free, but I
started asking myself this question, but

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:14.340
why would I wanna prioritize community?

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:19.409
Because it is valuable not only for
me and for other people in that.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.379
And so we're gonna get to more
is community only inspire groups?

00:26:22.379 --> 00:26:23.790
No, it's not.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:24.960
We're gonna, we're gonna
continue with that.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.649
There's more to it, but let's just
continue on with, with this here.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.950
Um, in verse 45, right?

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.900
Those 44 or 43 and 44.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.590
So in 45 it says this, it says
they sold their possessions and

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:42.240
property and distributed, um,
the proceeds to all who had need.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:42.690
Right?

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:47.700
And so we look at this as is,
as they function together, as

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:53.010
one, they were unified, they saw
each other's needs as their own.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.470
And this is the cool part
that I've seen inspiring.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.680
Hope.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.680
I I've seen this actually
fleshed out in our church.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:04.080
And it excites me that we see
our community of believers.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.955
And as those who are new in our church,
As part of our family, as part of our

00:27:08.955 --> 00:27:13.965
responsibility to take care of not
only from a selling property, right.

00:27:13.965 --> 00:27:18.495
To, to provide a need, but even
meeting needs as mills meeting

00:27:18.495 --> 00:27:23.175
needs as coming and helping move to
doing all kinds of things like that.

00:27:23.385 --> 00:27:25.095
They did that same thing, right.

00:27:25.155 --> 00:27:28.695
They did whatever they could, their
time, their talents and their treasures.

00:27:28.695 --> 00:27:30.825
And they gave that to those who had.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.460
I just challenge you.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.970
That's why we also give as a church
because as we give as a church, we

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.170
don't only invest in each other.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:40.440
We invest in our community
and meet those same needs.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:45.660
Then we look at the first part of
46 or excuse the second part of 46,

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.300
cuz we've kind of covered the first
part of 46, but it says this every

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.210
day, they devoted themselves to the
meeting together in the temple and

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.920
breaking up bread from house to house.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:57.540
And the result of those
dedications, those devotions was

00:27:57.545 --> 00:27:59.430
they ate their food with joyful.

00:27:59.865 --> 00:28:02.895
And sincere hearts,
joyful and sincere hearts.

00:28:03.045 --> 00:28:04.245
Guys, I'll just tell you this.

00:28:04.605 --> 00:28:11.295
When you spend time in community,
the overflow from that is joyful

00:28:11.295 --> 00:28:15.285
hearts and, and it's just in the
simple things of eating food.

00:28:15.465 --> 00:28:20.505
I mean, I like food y'all I do, but
not, am I always just joyful about it?

00:28:20.505 --> 00:28:23.595
They were joyful about it because
they understood that everything

00:28:23.595 --> 00:28:24.555
they have is a blessing from.

00:28:25.395 --> 00:28:26.055
Understood.

00:28:26.085 --> 00:28:28.245
Everything that they have
is a blessing from God.

00:28:28.365 --> 00:28:33.015
So they could see joy, even if, and,
and many of these people aren't rich

00:28:33.015 --> 00:28:36.585
people that just have food all the time,
but these people, most of them were

00:28:36.585 --> 00:28:40.725
joyful because we just saw the verses
before their needs were being met.

00:28:41.175 --> 00:28:44.205
Like they've never been met
before they begin to praise God.

00:28:44.235 --> 00:28:45.495
We see this at verse 47.

00:28:45.495 --> 00:28:48.555
The result of living in a
community is praising God and

00:28:48.555 --> 00:28:50.385
enjoying the favor of all people.

00:28:51.135 --> 00:28:53.895
So God received praise.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.899
For people living in community because
he was working in and through them.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:58.680
And I love this.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.290
He says they enjoyed favor
from all people, man.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.540
I don't think I'm living in
enough community at times.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.510
Whenever I think I'm wondering, I'm
probably not receiving favor from

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:11.430
all people, but what I would say in
this people begin to see God working

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:16.950
in that community and they were
interested that they were receiving

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.940
favor because typically what you would
even see in the old Testament is even

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.620
people who didn't believe in God.

00:29:23.205 --> 00:29:27.375
Would know that God's hands
was on a people and, and they

00:29:27.375 --> 00:29:28.935
would be envious of them.

00:29:28.935 --> 00:29:31.815
They would, they would be in
favor with them because they

00:29:31.815 --> 00:29:33.225
didn't wanna mess anything up.

00:29:33.555 --> 00:29:36.254
Well, we see the same thing as God
was working through these people.

00:29:36.405 --> 00:29:38.024
They had favor with all kinds of people.

00:29:38.024 --> 00:29:40.695
And I would even say this guys as
we continue to live in community

00:29:40.725 --> 00:29:43.965
with one another, as we continue
to serve our community, which we'll

00:29:43.965 --> 00:29:48.885
talk about next week, we have already
seen favor in our city because of.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.890
And we look at this and
we see, what does God do?

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.350
God works through living in community.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.750
And I would say this, how many of
y'all like to hang out with people?

00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:59.100
Right?

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.780
Like we, we, we enjoy it.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.530
We do.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.860
But at times I know this
just take inspir group.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.110
But times whenever we were doing
an inspire group, I felt like

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:11.490
it was a chore or know why, cuz
it didn't see the value in it.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:16.350
I only saw the difficulty
of creating the environment.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.540
I missed the joy in it.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.670
And so I started looking and
pouring over this and I started

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.320
reflecting on all the groups.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.580
I've been a part of guys.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.350
This is the craziest thing.

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:31.590
Our church started as a community
at home and Riley on zoom and Brock.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:32.550
And Jenna just moved here.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.020
That was how it started.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:39.000
And somehow a couple more people showed
up and a couple more people showed up

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:44.280
and we lived in community and we laughed
and we ate and we hung out and we prayed

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.560
and we devoted ourselves to one another.

00:30:48.165 --> 00:30:52.035
Do you know that hasn't changed
that commitment as a church hasn't

00:30:52.035 --> 00:30:56.475
changed yet we have now more groups
and we have now the, the temple

00:30:56.475 --> 00:30:59.115
meeting that, that shouldn't change.

00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:02.895
And those relationships though,
maybe in different groups now,

00:31:02.895 --> 00:31:04.605
cuz y'all know this, right?

00:31:04.935 --> 00:31:11.055
The hardest part of starting multiple
groups is saying bye to the other group

00:31:11.055 --> 00:31:12.525
that you spent all this time with.

00:31:13.035 --> 00:31:15.225
And remembering that, that
group's still gonna be.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.400
The big time and occasional times
together, but that group needs to

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.370
continue to reach new people while this
new group's reached into new people.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:26.400
I'm just telling you, it was the hardest
thing to do for me and Brittney, when

00:31:26.405 --> 00:31:30.330
we helped start four different groups,
we left well three, because the last

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.930
group, we, I guess we technically left
two, but it was difficult to lead those

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.580
groups because we loved those people.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.850
But you know what motivated
us to go start new groups.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.760
You wanna know, know what motivated Brock
and Jenna to go start a crazy group with

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.220
us and then move across the world with us.

00:31:45.135 --> 00:31:50.265
Because they saw the people that they
would go impact the people that we

00:31:50.265 --> 00:31:55.125
would go impact as a greater burden
than the burden of leaving friends,

00:31:55.995 --> 00:31:57.585
burden of leaving those relationships.

00:31:58.515 --> 00:32:02.505
All of us, if they weren't good
friendships, you probably weren't

00:32:02.505 --> 00:32:04.785
in a good group, so it's gonna hurt.

00:32:05.355 --> 00:32:08.745
But what I would say with this, and I'm
just, I'm wanting us to come back to

00:32:08.745 --> 00:32:11.835
this idea of, and we're getting ready
to get to the, the fruit of community.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:18.690
Is that as we live in community,
we will have new communities start

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:24.180
where we aren't as close, but those
communities can become the communities

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.560
that we started with as a church.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.490
When we started in our home, if we'll
dedicate and devote ourselves to them.

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:34.755
At times it's difficult, but in the
difficult work, some of the greatest

00:32:34.815 --> 00:32:36.585
results, what are those great results?

00:32:36.585 --> 00:32:41.115
We see this in the last part of 47,
the fruit of living in community,

00:32:41.175 --> 00:32:42.435
the fruit of living in community.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:47.205
It says this on the last part
of verse 47, it says every day,

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.095
the Lord added to their number.

00:32:49.365 --> 00:32:50.385
Those who are being.

00:32:52.169 --> 00:32:55.230
I want, I want you to
see this as a church.

00:32:55.679 --> 00:32:59.520
I I've heard these statements from other
people and I, I warrant them because

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.360
I, I understand the burden that they
fill, but I love our little community.

00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:05.159
I, I love our little group of church.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:08.730
If we add any more people, we'll
lose touch with one another.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:14.219
And my challenge is don't forget.

00:33:15.135 --> 00:33:18.285
That this community reached you and,
and the value that you find in this

00:33:18.285 --> 00:33:22.905
community and that you see that there,
there are other people, there are other

00:33:22.905 --> 00:33:29.295
people out there wanting that community,
wanting people who will meet their needs,

00:33:29.505 --> 00:33:32.385
people who will show them the love of
Christ, people who will prey with them.

00:33:32.565 --> 00:33:35.895
People who will commit
themselves to one another.

00:33:36.525 --> 00:33:37.275
They're waiting on.

00:33:38.355 --> 00:33:42.435
To go live in community with one
another and to go start new communities

00:33:42.585 --> 00:33:44.264
so that we can see the fruit.

00:33:44.504 --> 00:33:49.545
More people come to experience that same
experience that you've experienced, right?

00:33:49.545 --> 00:33:54.045
Because these believers lived in
community and did life with one another.

00:33:54.075 --> 00:33:56.264
The lives of those around
them were being changed.

00:33:58.485 --> 00:34:03.075
They were, they were being a picture
to the lost and hurting world around.

00:34:04.469 --> 00:34:08.969
This is, I'll just tell you, I, I,
if I could define inspiring hope, I

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:16.080
wanna define us as a community that
lives together, just like this guys.

00:34:16.085 --> 00:34:20.639
If we can't dedicate to this, I don't know
if I wanna be dedicated to anything else.

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:21.779
I really don't.

00:34:21.779 --> 00:34:23.909
And that's really the burden that
God's been putting on my heart.

00:34:24.089 --> 00:34:27.839
If we don't get back to the genuineness
of living in community together and

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:30.900
starting more communities to invite
people into, we're gonna miss the.

00:34:31.605 --> 00:34:33.585
Of why God's called us
to plant this church.

00:34:34.574 --> 00:34:35.625
This community needs it.

00:34:35.625 --> 00:34:36.585
Your neighbors need it.

00:34:36.585 --> 00:34:37.605
Your family needs it.

00:34:38.235 --> 00:34:38.895
We need it.

00:34:40.665 --> 00:34:45.645
What is it gonna take dedicating
it and devoting ourselves to these

00:34:45.645 --> 00:34:52.455
things, not out of a burden, but out
of excitement, out of an opportunity.

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:57.945
So the greatest way to experience growth
in your personal walk and God's kingdom

00:34:57.945 --> 00:34:59.295
is to live in community with one.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.460
So I wanna circle back to this.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.580
Is there only one way to live in
community together in inspire groups?

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.740
Cuz you know, it says that in the
Bible it's only in inspire groups.

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:08.670
No.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.050
Yes.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.870
There's discipleship relationships
and there's work relationships and

00:35:12.875 --> 00:35:14.130
there's neighbor relationships.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:17.010
But I wanna, I wanna point
out one specific thing here

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:18.510
that he does talk about.

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:23.040
He is talking about believers
gathering together in communities.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:24.750
So yes we should have.

00:35:25.545 --> 00:35:28.845
Some groups where we have a lot of lost
people involved, or we're hanging out

00:35:28.845 --> 00:35:29.955
with neighbors and doing those things.

00:35:29.955 --> 00:35:33.975
And that's part of community living that,
but this community was specifically for

00:35:33.975 --> 00:35:35.685
the believers to build one another up.

00:35:35.685 --> 00:35:37.515
We go back to encourage one another up.

00:35:37.995 --> 00:35:40.335
And yes, there was people being
added to them daily because they

00:35:40.335 --> 00:35:43.185
were seeing it and they were
invited into it and experiencing it.

00:35:43.935 --> 00:35:48.015
So inspire groups is the way that we see
as a way to commit to fleshing that out.

00:35:48.015 --> 00:35:52.395
And so I, I wanna say this, if
you don't plan for something, we

00:35:52.395 --> 00:35:54.495
all have great intentions, you all
have great intentions of eating.

00:35:55.335 --> 00:35:58.605
Until you look in your fridge and you
see cheesecake rather than, you know,

00:35:58.605 --> 00:36:00.975
something healthy and you eat cheesecake.

00:36:02.205 --> 00:36:05.895
I, I, my guess I'm just gonna
throw a guess out here, everybody

00:36:05.895 --> 00:36:09.045
in this room probably desires to
live in community with one another.

00:36:09.225 --> 00:36:11.805
Maybe you're already doing it, but
you desire and you desire to see other

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:15.795
people live in community, but what's
the difference between leaving out here

00:36:15.795 --> 00:36:19.605
and being a part of that community and
helping others be involved in it or not.

00:36:20.475 --> 00:36:23.895
It's actually putting something
down to hold you accountable to.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.200
If you'll commit to being a
part of an inspire group once

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.450
a week, it's there every week.

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:34.950
It's a group of people that are expecting
you that are gonna hold you accountable.

00:36:34.955 --> 00:36:37.620
That's gonna help you grow in your
faith and to be a part of this thing.

00:36:37.625 --> 00:36:39.810
And, and yes, I want you
to do more than that.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:43.590
I want you to hang out with people at your
work and, and live in community with them.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.420
And I want you to hang out with
your neighbors and those things.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.090
And for me right now, I'm gonna hang
out with people on the football.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.000
I don't know what I'm doing, but
I can hang out with those people

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.200
cuz they're crazier than I am.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.750
But I'm trying to figure out
how to do community there too.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.560
But I believe God's called us to
a community of believers as well.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.120
That's why we have that.

00:37:00.125 --> 00:37:01.650
That's why we're launching
these groups again.

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:04.290
That's why we're wanting to
prioritize that as a church.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:08.940
So we have to make it a consistent thing.

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.170
So I'm, I'm gonna finish up this way.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:10.920
I I'm gonna be done.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:11.460
I promise.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.020
So as we seek God's word to see
how we should live our lives

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.520
after giving your lives to Jesus.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.200
We see that living in community
is the next logical step, the

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.000
next logical step for them.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.630
And for us not to begrudgingly do
it because that's what we have to

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:31.350
do, because I'm just telling you if
you have that heart, oh, just tell

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:32.400
me, and I'm gonna pray for you.

00:37:32.405 --> 00:37:35.550
And we're gonna talk about not having
the heart of this is what I have to do.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:41.730
No, we saw today the benefits
of being a part of community.

00:37:42.359 --> 00:37:45.359
That's why we are a part of
community because we see that

00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:47.910
as we devote ourselves, there's
this fruit that comes out of it.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.640
And there's these things that we
get to experience these, these

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.490
things that we would've never
experienced apart from that community.

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:59.490
I hope today you are being drawn
in and, and wanna be a part of

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:00.990
community to experience that.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:04.319
So during our time of invitation, this
is one on one challenge you with what's

00:38:04.319 --> 00:38:06.359
stopping you from being a part of C.

00:38:06.915 --> 00:38:08.775
So, so I wanna speak to everybody.

00:38:08.835 --> 00:38:10.815
Hey, well, when we start back up
groups, I'll be there every week.

00:38:10.845 --> 00:38:11.505
Okay, great.

00:38:11.505 --> 00:38:16.425
What's stopping you from being committed
to that community even more because we can

00:38:16.425 --> 00:38:20.505
attend community for me or we can invest
in the community that we're a part of.

00:38:20.505 --> 00:38:22.575
And that's the part I wanna
continue to challenge everybody.

00:38:22.635 --> 00:38:24.825
Everybody has a next step.

00:38:25.185 --> 00:38:28.005
It may not all look the same,
but everybody has an next step.

00:38:28.005 --> 00:38:32.655
For some of you what's stopping you
from being a part of community, right.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.305
To, to experience this overflow of C.

00:38:36.255 --> 00:38:39.375
Is it because there isn't a night
that we do an inspire group together,

00:38:39.375 --> 00:38:41.505
is it because you don't have a
group of people to do life with?

00:38:41.775 --> 00:38:45.345
And if that's true, that's why you
have a card there to fill out and say,

00:38:45.345 --> 00:38:46.875
Hey, there's even notes down there.

00:38:46.875 --> 00:38:49.035
You can write down, Hey, none of
these nights work, none of these

00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:52.155
days work because my life's crazy
busy, but I desire community.

00:38:52.215 --> 00:38:54.645
You know what we'll do, we'll
reach out and we'll talk about how

00:38:54.645 --> 00:38:55.755
can we create community with you.

00:38:56.175 --> 00:38:59.685
If you circle a night that we don't
have an inspired group, what can we do?

00:38:59.685 --> 00:39:01.755
Just like what we talked
about, every inspire.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.860
Once we have these things going,
we'll have three inspire groups.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.520
Every one of those groups will have
people attached to them that may

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.740
never attend that group because it
doesn't match up with their night,

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.240
but they're going to minister to you.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.420
They're gonna invite you into
community as you have opportunity

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.490
to, and we're gonna create that guys.

00:39:17.495 --> 00:39:21.570
The future of inspiring hope is
focusing on living in community.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:25.290
The overflow of that
will change your life.

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.570
Change this church's life and
will change this community's life.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:28.650
I believe.

00:39:30.075 --> 00:39:31.905
That's why we are talking about this.

00:39:31.905 --> 00:39:35.805
This is why I am who I am, because the
communities that I've been a part of have

00:39:35.805 --> 00:39:39.705
made me the person I am today because
Jesus worked through those communities

00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:45.315
and I can't help, but wanna be a part of
the next person that gets to experience

00:39:45.315 --> 00:39:49.725
the community that I've been a part of
and be changed to be a part of another

00:39:49.725 --> 00:39:51.135
community, be a part of another community.

00:39:51.495 --> 00:39:53.415
So what's stopping you
from being a part of that.

00:39:53.805 --> 00:39:55.005
I also challenge you with this.

00:39:55.005 --> 00:39:56.805
Maybe you've never even taken the.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.800
Of giving your life to Jesus.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.270
What's stopping you from giving
your life to Jesus only, you

00:40:03.275 --> 00:40:04.830
know that, and Jesus knows that.

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:09.090
So during invitation, I challenge you
to ask God what it looks like to take a

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:15.330
next step to follow Jesus or a next step
to be in community with one another.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:20.530
Please fill out those cards, write
down where you're interested in being

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:26.940
a part of a group, but I'll just
tell you this don't make an excuse.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:33.540
Everybody has 'em, but community is more
important than whatever excuse we can make

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.340
because God wants to work in your life
and the lives of those of the community.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:42.480
You're a part of, so let's
pray, Lord, Jesus, Lord.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.300
We thank you Lord, because you are good.

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:47.340
We thank you because your word is truth.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:51.720
And Lord, as we, as a church,
look deep into your word.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:56.340
And as we go back to really
our, our roots of, of why we.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:03.690
We are reminded Lord, the
number one we are to follow you.

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:08.879
We are to lay down everything that
is hindering our, our walk on our

00:41:08.884 --> 00:41:11.700
life and we follow after you Lord.

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:15.060
And as we look at your
example, your example was set.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:18.720
When you first begin your ministry,
where you brought a community in to

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:23.819
live life with do life, with encouraged
to teach, but then Lord, whenever.

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:27.390
Left this earth and left the
holy spirit to live in our lives.

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:31.620
You set another example of community
that the next logical step after

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:37.799
following you is to do life with one
another, to be devoted to these things,

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:44.819
to Weiss, teaching, to prayer, to the
fellowship, to one another, to breaking

00:41:44.819 --> 00:41:48.509
up bread, to meeting together in the
temple, to meeting together in each

00:41:48.509 --> 00:41:52.020
other's homes to experience the outflow.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:58.410
Of those things, Lord, to see people's
needs being met, many wanders and

00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:04.860
signs, being done, more people coming
to faith in you, praise and worship.

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:05.700
Lord.

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.890
These are things that we
desire to see as a church.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:11.130
And I believe every person in this
room desires to experience that.

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:15.030
But Lord, there is something that
may be hindering them from that Lord.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:16.140
Will you remove it today?

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.980
Lord, I'm asking you right.

00:42:20.985 --> 00:42:26.745
Not in my power Lord by desire
is that you remove whatever it is

00:42:26.745 --> 00:42:30.045
that is hindering anybody in this
room to be a part of community.

00:42:30.315 --> 00:42:32.925
If it's work, Lord, will you remove it?

00:42:33.815 --> 00:42:37.245
If, if it's an unwillingness to
be vulnerable, because it's just

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:40.215
a struggle to be part of a small
group, Lord, will you remove it?

00:42:41.295 --> 00:42:45.435
If it's just anxiety, if it's, if
it's busyness, I Lord, I don't know,

00:42:45.435 --> 00:42:46.605
but whatever it is, Lord, will you.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:50.850
Lord, will you take those
who weren't even here today?

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:53.550
And Lord, as I get an opportunity
to share this message with them this

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:56.850
week, and as they begin to contemplate
Lord what their next step is, Lord,

00:42:56.855 --> 00:42:58.500
will you remove the barriers there?

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.480
Lord, I, I know this we've done
all that we can, and it's nothing

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:08.009
compared to all that you can.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.410
And so that Lord, that's
why we're praying.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:16.380
That's why we're using your
word to remind us of who we are.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.980
Because apart from your word,
apart from you and apart from

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.080
prayer, Lord, we can do nothing.

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:29.610
So Lord, my desire, our desire as
a church is to know you more and to

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:34.740
experience the community that you've
called us to devote ourselves to Lord,

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:40.770
to give us the passion and desire and
the inspiration Lord to go out and to, to

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:44.250
share that with other people and to invite
them into the community that we have.

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:45.980
Lord.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.230
We are praying for life
change in our community.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.600
We're praying for one more person.

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:55.590
One more person has
experienced your hope Lord.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:59.820
That's the last thing that I wanna pray
today is that if there is a person in

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.420
this room that has not given their life
to you, Lord, may they not leave today

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.440
before they give their life to you?

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:06.960
Lord, may they repent their sin?

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.480
May they confess you as Lord?

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:11.250
May they take a next step of.

00:44:11.745 --> 00:44:11.835
Them.

00:44:12.645 --> 00:44:16.515
And may they begin the journey of living
in community with one another Lord, if

00:44:16.515 --> 00:44:19.424
there's a person in this room, Lord,
I pray that they come back and talk

00:44:19.424 --> 00:44:23.384
to me after service Lord that they
share with me their need to follow you.

00:44:23.384 --> 00:44:23.595
Lord.

00:44:23.595 --> 00:44:26.234
If there's a person in this room
whose relationship with Jesus has been

00:44:26.234 --> 00:44:28.005
hindered, Lord, may you forgive them?

00:44:28.484 --> 00:44:30.525
May you restore that relationship?

00:44:31.634 --> 00:44:35.234
And may you continue to take us Lord
from here as individuals and as a church

00:44:35.505 --> 00:44:39.975
to live in community together because
you have so called us to do that.

00:44:42.525 --> 00:44:43.904
Lord, we thank you for today.

00:44:43.904 --> 00:44:46.154
We thank you for everything
that you'll do in our lives.

00:44:46.694 --> 00:44:47.525
And we pray this in your head.

00:44:48.634 --> 00:44:48.924
Amen.
