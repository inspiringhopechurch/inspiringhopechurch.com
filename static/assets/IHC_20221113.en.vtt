00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.450
Paul is in Rome.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.730
He's in prison, and he knows
that his life is almost over.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.760
That's the context now in which we read.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.990
He looks back on God's goodness
to him, and he looks forward

00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:20.820
to the dangers and the hope.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.840
The Lord stood by me, gave me
strength to proclaim the message.

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:40.245
Well, it is, uh, another great
cold day to hang out with y'all.

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:42.825
Um, I don't know about you, but
I think I could have handled

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.875
a couple more weeks of warmth.

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:47.834
I know this is usually unique to
be this warm that long and now it's

00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:49.455
cold, but it's almost like this shock.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.870
It's like, let's go from 70 to snow.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.040
Um, and then of course I do what you
shouldn't do in Ohio, which is when

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.220
it snows, don't clean up your car
till the next day, which means then it

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.690
was iced and I should have done that.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.430
So I will remember next time, hopefully,
um, but hopefully you guys had a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.170
great week and are coming in today
excited about, um, God's word and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.340
what he has to share with us today.

00:01:12.565 --> 00:01:14.604
Um, we're gonna be in
second Timothy chapter two.

00:01:14.604 --> 00:01:16.615
We're gonna complete the chapter today.

00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:21.294
Um, we'll be starting in verse
19 of second Timothy chapter two.

00:01:21.804 --> 00:01:24.354
Um, one of the things just kind
of give everybody a heads up just

00:01:24.354 --> 00:01:27.115
to re remind y'all, talk more
about it at the end of service.

00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:31.824
But, um, next Sunday we will
not have service, um, here.

00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:35.964
And so we are doing, uh, the Hamilton
welcomes the holidays on Saturday night.

00:01:35.964 --> 00:01:36.524
That's our.

00:01:37.335 --> 00:01:38.955
We typically do on a surf Sunday.

00:01:39.255 --> 00:01:40.335
It's gonna be on a Saturday.

00:01:40.395 --> 00:01:44.295
And so go and serve and be a part of that,
and that'll be our part of gathering.

00:01:44.655 --> 00:01:49.245
Um, and then we'll meet back on the
27th, I believe, and that'll be, um,

00:01:49.245 --> 00:01:52.635
the week that we actually will take
a, a break from second Timothy and

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.045
we'll jump into a four week series, uh,
with Christmas, uh, Christmas series.

00:01:57.105 --> 00:01:58.935
And I think you guys will
be excited about that.

00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:01.635
And, uh, so just want to give
you some heads up to be prepared

00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:03.555
for that and, and not miss that.

00:02:04.845 --> 00:02:09.015
Um, I wanna start off with this question,
uh, and I'm hoping, uh, I know the

00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:10.305
answer, but I'm gonna ask this question.

00:02:10.604 --> 00:02:14.325
How many of you in this room want
to be used by God to do great

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:15.435
in mighty things in your life?

00:02:15.705 --> 00:02:16.605
If you do, where is you?

00:02:17.265 --> 00:02:17.955
Cool.

00:02:18.255 --> 00:02:21.975
Most majority, some, uh,
would say that, right?

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:25.455
And this is good because when you
answer that question, everything

00:02:25.455 --> 00:02:27.495
that follows hopefully will help.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.554
Be used by God in great and mighty ways.

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:34.155
Um, this text is really going to
challenge us in that way and this

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.885
idea of, of being used by God.

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:38.685
How can we be used by God?

00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:40.635
And and, and what is it going to take?

00:02:40.635 --> 00:02:42.584
And obviously God's got
a part in it, right?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.430
Um, but we do as well.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.480
And, uh, it's, it's interesting how
God brings us out in this text and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.090
how Paul shares it with us, and so
I'm excited to share it with you.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.980
Um, but I wanna start off with this.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.680
Um, have you ever been in a job or
maybe in a gym or somewhere around

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.769
another person where it seems like
things are always going right for them?

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.480
They're getting the breaks,
they're getting the promotions.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.840
They always seem to be, again, I think
Jim, like they're lifting heavier.

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.359
They always seem to be having
something greater than you, right?

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.180
And you sit there and go,
What is it going to take?

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.200
For me to get that promotion, what's
it going to take for me to, to lift

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.360
that weight or to to be that person?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.610
And again, I know that may not be
great in that self-reflection because

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.340
we should measure self against
other people, but I think at times

00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:25.380
we aspire to be something greater.

00:03:26.265 --> 00:03:30.375
And I hope today we'll see that God
desires for us to be greatly used

00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:35.065
by him, and, uh, that he desires
to do exceedingly, abundantly,

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:37.185
more than you can ask or think.

00:03:37.545 --> 00:03:39.735
So you may not even know right
now, you may be sitting here

00:03:39.735 --> 00:03:40.965
going, You know, God can't use me.

00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:42.915
I mean, I, I'm not really special.

00:03:43.335 --> 00:03:46.185
But you're gonna find that
God thinks you're special.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.250
And he has some amazing things
for you to be a part of.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.000
So we're gonna learn this, that as we
empty ourselves of sin, selfishness,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.359
and distractions in our life, and
replace them with the pursuit of

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.230
righteousness, faith, love, and
peace, that God will invite us into

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.579
opportunities to serve him in ways like
we've never thought we could be served.

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:06.744
That we could serve God.

00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:09.535
Um, and so just to kind of remind
us where we are again, second

00:04:09.535 --> 00:04:12.084
Timothy, Paul's writing into
Timothy is True Son of the Faith.

00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:14.155
I'm trying to be a little bit
shorter in this summary cuz most

00:04:14.155 --> 00:04:16.615
of you have been around long enough
that you're like, Okay, we get it.

00:04:16.974 --> 00:04:18.385
But what do we know about repetition?

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.034
Repetition brings about memorization?

00:04:20.034 --> 00:04:24.205
Memorization allows us that as we
continue to live out our faith, that

00:04:24.205 --> 00:04:26.664
hopefully you'll be like, you know,
I'm so tired of Pastor Ben mentioning

00:04:26.664 --> 00:04:29.275
everything about Second Timothy, that
when you're having a conversation with

00:04:29.275 --> 00:04:32.094
somebody and they're saying, Hey, I'm
really struggling in my faith, and

00:04:32.094 --> 00:04:35.745
you can think, you know, Paul said to
Timothy one day that, that we really

00:04:35.745 --> 00:04:39.224
need to fan into flame the faith that I
see in you, that I've seen in your life.

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:41.985
You'll remember the scripture,
you'll remember why Paul wrote this

00:04:41.985 --> 00:04:43.575
letter, and it'll be useful for you.

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:45.255
So don't hate the messenger.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.575
I'm just trying to prepare you.

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:50.175
Um, so second Timothy, again,
Paul is encouraging Timothy

00:04:50.175 --> 00:04:51.675
in his faith because Timothy.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.960
Uh, would be a little bit
timid or a little bit afraid.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.979
Obviously, his, his fa true father
in the faith is, is in prison being

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.849
persecuted for his, his faith, and
he is going to to head towards death.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.190
And so that may be a little
bit scary to Timothy.

00:05:05.549 --> 00:05:08.789
Uh, and because of that, Paul once
makes sure that Timothy doesn't shrink

00:05:08.794 --> 00:05:11.370
back and really steps into the role.

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:15.015
That, uh, Paul is going to leave
as a void and he's gonna step into

00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:16.395
that role of leading the church.

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:19.955
And so he's challenging him in his
faith and his gift, and he's challenging

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:23.565
Timothy to join him in the suffering
because the suffering is worth it

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.945
in the reward that he's receives.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.485
And, and to train other believers to
come alongside Timothy to continue

00:05:28.485 --> 00:05:30.345
to take that message to the world.

00:05:30.555 --> 00:05:32.955
And then he, he's been dealing with
this in the last couple of verses

00:05:32.955 --> 00:05:36.475
that we've been dealing with, is to
avoid certain things that distract

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.825
us, distract the church from the
mission that God has called us.

00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:43.095
And so he's not just speaking
this over Timothy's life.

00:05:43.095 --> 00:05:46.305
The cool part is because the word of
godes came to each one of us in this room.

00:05:46.485 --> 00:05:49.995
God is speaking this over your
life, and so when we read the

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:52.635
scripture, we should always read
it in context who he's talking to.

00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:55.335
But then we need to ask the
question, What does this mean for me?

00:05:55.965 --> 00:05:56.865
What does this mean for me?

00:05:56.924 --> 00:05:58.815
How does this apply to mean?

00:05:59.085 --> 00:06:03.164
And so we're gonna continue on in
this idea of avoiding distractions

00:06:03.495 --> 00:06:05.085
and beginning something new.

00:06:05.085 --> 00:06:09.495
And so again, we're gonna read in second
Timothy chapter two starting in verse 19.

00:06:09.914 --> 00:06:11.685
Uh, and this is what Paul says.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.664
He says, Nevertheless, God's
solid foundation stands.

00:06:17.745 --> 00:06:22.425
Bearing this inscription, the
Lord knows those who are his.

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:27.225
And let everyone who calls on the name
of the Lord turn away from wickedness.

00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:32.895
Now, in a large house, there are not only
golden silver vessels, but also those

00:06:32.895 --> 00:06:37.905
of wood and clay, some for honorable
use and some for dishonorable use.

00:06:38.295 --> 00:06:43.740
So if anyone purifies him, From anything
dishonorable, he will be a special

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.750
instrument set apart, useful to the
master, prepared for every good work.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.760
I want you to take that verse,
I want you to memorize it.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.490
I want you to write that down
and repeat that to yourself.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.240
I'm gonna read one more time.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.110
I'm gonna continue on.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.750
So if anyone purifies himself, Or
herself from anything dishonorable.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.730
He will be special instrument
set apart, useful to the master,

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.380
prepared for every good work.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:14.130
And he says, Flee from youthful passions
and pursue righteousness, faith, love,

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.780
and peace along with those who are called
um, who call on the Lord from a pure.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.020
But reject foolish and ignorant disputes
because you know that they breed quarrels.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.000
The Lord's servant must not quarrel,
but must be gentle to everyone able

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.020
to teach and patient instructing
his opponents with gentleness.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.930
Perhaps God will grant them
repentance, leading them to

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:37.890
the knowledge of the truth.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.030
Then they may come to their senses
and escape the trap of the devil who

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.270
has taken them captive to do his.

00:07:44.775 --> 00:07:45.375
So let's pray.

00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:49.755
Lord Jesus, we pray, Lord, that your
word does not return void, Lord, and

00:07:49.755 --> 00:07:53.955
that it changes our lives today, Lord,
that we leave outta here, uh, with a

00:07:54.455 --> 00:07:58.635
reminder that we can be greatly used by
you as we surrender ourselves over to

00:07:58.635 --> 00:08:00.765
you and pursue our relationship with you.

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:02.534
And so, Lord, we just pray
this in your heavenly name.

00:08:02.725 --> 00:08:03.215
Amen.

00:08:04.095 --> 00:08:09.105
So just to remind you and remind
myself as well what just happened

00:08:09.105 --> 00:08:12.835
in the verses before, cuz he says
nevertheless, so if you remember,

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.115
there was some, what we say is, uh,
unhealthy conversations in the church.

00:08:18.105 --> 00:08:23.325
There was some conversations that were
not godly, so ungodly conversations

00:08:23.325 --> 00:08:25.785
that were happening in the church that
was causing disputes in the church,

00:08:26.115 --> 00:08:28.905
arguments in the church that was
distracting them from the mission.

00:08:29.115 --> 00:08:32.985
And then he began to point out two men
who actually was teaching wrong theology.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.705
They were teaching that the resurrection
had already happened, and these men were

00:08:36.855 --> 00:08:39.135
leading people to stray from their faith.

00:08:39.765 --> 00:08:45.840
And he says this, nevertheless, And he
begins to talk about really God's house.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.220
And he begins to talk first in verse
19 about God's solid foundation.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.080
And so he says Nevertheless.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.680
And so basically what he's saying is,
in spite of all these useless arguments

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.850
and ungodly discussions that have
happened in the church, that have led

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.920
others to ruin in their faith, despite
that and all the brokenness around.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.360
God never changes.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.700
God's foundation never changes.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.620
His truth stands the test of time.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.720
And his truth stands the challenges
that we face from false teachers, from

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.810
false information, from the infighting.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.430
It, it, it changes us.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:25.950
It, it never, his, his truth never
changes, but it changes us in how,

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.930
um, it continues to affect our life.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.120
And so Paul describes, again, this great.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.240
When you think about a great
house, again, he's thinking about

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.590
the house of God, and within that
house of God, um, is the people of.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.980
And he starts again with this foundation.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.560
And we know this, that the foundation
of our faith is what will help us

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.189
live out our faith consistently for
the glory of God and for the benefit

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:51.630
of ourselves and those around us.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.280
And I can't help but thinking of
Matthew Chapter 7 24 through 27.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.770
Most of you have probably heard
this before, but it says this,

00:09:58.775 --> 00:10:03.569
Therefore, everyone who hears
these words of mine and acts on.

00:10:04.235 --> 00:10:07.834
Will be like wise men who built
his house on a rock and the rain

00:10:07.834 --> 00:10:11.615
fell and the rivers rose and the
winds blew and pounded that house.

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:16.925
Yet it didn't collapse because
its foundation was on the rock.

00:10:17.464 --> 00:10:21.905
But then he says this, but everyone
who hears these words of mine and

00:10:21.905 --> 00:10:24.665
doesn't act on them will be foolish.

00:10:25.145 --> 00:10:27.605
It'd be a foolish man who
built his house on the sand.

00:10:27.995 --> 00:10:31.985
The rain fell and the rivers rose and the
winds blew and pounded that house and it.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.760
And it collapsed with a great crash.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.680
What's that remind you?

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.870
Is that as a church, Paul is telling
us and he's telling Timothy that

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:49.260
our foundation as a church, as a,
as a follower of Christ is on Jesus.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.580
It's on his word.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.940
And I think it's so critical, cuz
this is the part that I think that

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:59.085
all of us can understand is that
every week, We're hearing truth,

00:10:59.085 --> 00:11:00.225
especially at least on Sundays.

00:11:00.225 --> 00:11:03.075
I'm hoping every day you're in the
word, but you're hearing truth.

00:11:03.465 --> 00:11:05.565
He doesn't say just who hears.

00:11:05.925 --> 00:11:10.695
It's, who hears and follows will have a
solid, solid foundation, not who hears and

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.155
ignores, they will have a weak foundation.

00:11:13.665 --> 00:11:16.935
So it's the responsibility and this
is the the huge part where we think

00:11:16.935 --> 00:11:19.035
about God has provided salvation.

00:11:19.245 --> 00:11:20.865
God has provided the word.

00:11:21.825 --> 00:11:24.615
We have been given the
ability to accept or.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.070
And if we want a solid foundation
that allows us to be strong in our

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:34.530
faith and to be used by God, we need
to follow or act on those words.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.630
And so that's the challenge that
Paul gives us, gives Timothy and this

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.199
idea to withstand false teaching,
to withstand all the things that

00:11:43.205 --> 00:11:44.670
are trying to attack our faith.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.080
We need a solid foundation.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.490
And so he mentions two things here.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.189
If you'll look there in the
verse, it says the, there's two.

00:11:50.194 --> 00:11:52.260
He says, Bearing these inscriptions.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.840
The Lord knows who are his.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:12:00.194
And then he says this, Um, And let
everyone who calls in the name of the

00:12:00.194 --> 00:12:02.685
Lord turn away from Wick wickedness.

00:12:03.045 --> 00:12:03.944
So here's the cool part.

00:12:03.944 --> 00:12:07.485
The Lord knows who is who is his, and
this is what he's basically saying is

00:12:08.025 --> 00:12:11.355
despite us looking and saying, Hey,
there, there's people in the church.

00:12:11.355 --> 00:12:13.785
And we look all around and there's,
there's some confusion and there's

00:12:13.785 --> 00:12:17.085
some people that are trying to, to be
deceiving and sometimes it's hard to

00:12:17.085 --> 00:12:18.345
know what is truth and what is not.

00:12:18.345 --> 00:12:23.655
The Lord knows who's His, and
those who know the Lord should

00:12:23.655 --> 00:12:25.035
know they are his as well.

00:12:25.035 --> 00:12:25.694
Well, how do we.

00:12:26.775 --> 00:12:30.944
He says this in the second part when
he mentions this and this idea that he

00:12:30.944 --> 00:12:35.115
says, Let everyone who calls in the name
of the Lord turn away from wickedness.

00:12:35.594 --> 00:12:36.824
It's this word called conviction.

00:12:36.824 --> 00:12:37.814
We talk about conviction.

00:12:37.819 --> 00:12:41.865
Conviction is something inside of
us, tells us what we are doing,

00:12:41.865 --> 00:12:44.324
what we are following, what we
are trying to believe is wrong.

00:12:44.324 --> 00:12:45.795
That's a spirit of God inside of us.

00:12:46.125 --> 00:12:51.375
And so as much that that God knows
who are his, we can know we are His

00:12:51.375 --> 00:12:55.395
as well through this conviction to
wanting to turn from our wicked.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:01.290
And so that would, that's a challenge
to all of us in this idea of, if

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.230
you ever wonder, man, am I saved,
have I given my life to Christ?

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.800
And, and the question is, do you
have a conviction inside that you

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.630
truly wanna follow after Jesus and
begin to, to purify yourself and, and

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.340
follow after Jesus, or do you not?

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.990
And that may be the true test.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.730
And if you don't guess what?

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.030
You still can choose God,
um, and, and follow after.

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:24.915
So Ephesians one, four says
this for, he chose us in him.

00:13:24.915 --> 00:13:29.265
So that's God choosing us before the
foundation of the world to be holy

00:13:29.415 --> 00:13:34.125
and blameless and love before him to
be set apart basically before God.

00:13:34.485 --> 00:13:36.705
And so here's kind of just
this idea with that verse, and

00:13:36.705 --> 00:13:37.635
we'll move, kind of move on.

00:13:37.965 --> 00:13:41.025
God knows who is hi his,
and that is awesome, right?

00:13:41.025 --> 00:13:42.195
God already knows that.

00:13:42.585 --> 00:13:46.125
But it's also important for us that
we can know that we are his i'll.

00:13:46.355 --> 00:13:49.275
I'll tell you this, the more
confident you are in your.

00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:51.510
You are Jesus's.

00:13:52.199 --> 00:13:54.750
You will go out and live your
faith because here's what you

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.610
know, nobody can take that away.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.660
You're untouch.

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:02.955
That's the crazy part that I think some
of us, we struggle to deal with, that

00:14:02.955 --> 00:14:06.705
the only way in which we can be touched,
which means our lives can be destroyed,

00:14:06.855 --> 00:14:10.095
or that we can be challenged in our faith,
or we can be, whatever you wanna call

00:14:10.095 --> 00:14:12.645
it, tested, is that the Lord allows that.

00:14:12.765 --> 00:14:16.725
That may be comforting to you or not,
but to me it is because that means this,

00:14:16.725 --> 00:14:20.385
that everything that God is doing in
my life is for a reason to grow me in

00:14:20.655 --> 00:14:25.425
my faith and to help others know him
with that confidence that I know I am.

00:14:26.579 --> 00:14:28.319
It changes the way I live my life.

00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:31.319
I, I've got unlimited resources from God.

00:14:31.589 --> 00:14:33.420
I've got unlimited faith from God.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:39.329
I've got unlimited hope and peace and
joy and these things in which we need,

00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:42.180
and that Timothy in this time needs.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.319
He needs to have this confidence in
God despite all the people around

00:14:46.319 --> 00:14:48.990
him that are trying to destroy the
church and trying to change the

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.520
information of what the truth is.

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:52.079
We all need this.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.510
We need to hear and we need to follow.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.380
So as Paul begins to describe now in
this next couple verses, this not only

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.130
this large house, but the what's inside
of it, uh, let's read these verses again

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.089
and then we'll kind of break it down.

00:15:03.089 --> 00:15:04.829
He says, Now in a large house.

00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:08.339
So we already know what the foundations
Christ right now in a large house,

00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:12.300
there's not only gold and silver
vessels, but also those of wooden clay.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.569
Some for honorable and some for dishonor.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.370
So if anyone purifies himself from
anything dishonorable, you'll be a special

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.820
instrument set apart, useful to the
master, and prepared for every good work.

00:15:25.065 --> 00:15:27.495
Again, these are moments where I
wish sometimes would just, can we

00:15:27.495 --> 00:15:28.815
just be plain with what this means?

00:15:28.815 --> 00:15:32.655
Because like gold and silver and his clay
and stuff, and so just the simple part

00:15:32.655 --> 00:15:34.035
of this, this is how we break this down.

00:15:34.365 --> 00:15:37.725
Paul describes the honor, the
people of honor are those who are

00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:40.095
of gold and silver vessels, right?

00:15:40.155 --> 00:15:41.745
Used for special services.

00:15:41.745 --> 00:15:42.225
Think of this.

00:15:42.225 --> 00:15:46.385
Anybody ever remember going to grandma's
house And the only time we got up to

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.975
find China was when people came over.

00:15:48.975 --> 00:15:49.515
It was a special.

00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:51.599
And you better not break it.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.360
And a lot of times the kids didn't
get to fine China, it was only adults.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.579
And then it would sit up in
the, you know, in storage.

00:15:56.579 --> 00:16:00.510
Well, here's the thing, We're
not just fine China because we

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.819
don't just come out every once
in a while for special occasions.

00:16:03.089 --> 00:16:07.079
But we're special in that idea
of, of something we hold special

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.449
use for special occasions.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.579
And so I would even say this, that we.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.040
We are honorable, right?

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.940
Gold and silver vessels we're well
equipped and pure for the greatest work.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.520
But then he goes on to talk
about the people of dishonor,

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.840
which would be the wooden clay.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:22.980
Think of wooden clay.

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.740
Does not last the test of time.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.270
And these things, or these people
would be false teachers or people

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.880
refusing to repent of their
stands or believe a false doc.

00:16:34.215 --> 00:16:37.455
Paul is sitting here describing people
in the church, and I think this is so

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:41.145
important cuz I think it's easy to look
at things and say, Well, this, in the

00:16:41.145 --> 00:16:42.795
church everybody's gold and silver.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.135
Outside of the church, we
would say that's wood and clay.

00:16:45.675 --> 00:16:50.745
He's talking about the people in the
church that can be either wood and

00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:54.695
clay that are falling away from the
truth, believing false teachings,

00:16:54.855 --> 00:16:57.345
not willing to repent of their sins.

00:16:58.035 --> 00:17:00.795
And then there can be people who
are well equipped that are purified

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.025
in their faith that are gold and.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.910
And so when we think about these
people in the church that he's

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.710
describing, we have a choice.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:12.270
He says, These vessels, which are
people of honor or dishonor, and I don't

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.040
want to be as clear as I possibly can.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.129
We have a choice in receiving salvation.

00:17:17.129 --> 00:17:20.160
We have a choice of being
used by God ultimately.

00:17:21.734 --> 00:17:23.805
Our faith comes from Jesus, right?

00:17:24.075 --> 00:17:27.315
Being saved is from what
Jesus has done in the cross.

00:17:27.315 --> 00:17:30.975
I never want you to think I need
to work in order to please God so

00:17:30.975 --> 00:17:32.355
that he forgives me of my sins.

00:17:32.655 --> 00:17:35.985
I want you to know this, that
Jesus Christ forgave you of your

00:17:35.985 --> 00:17:40.145
sins because of your faith and
what he did, not your works, but.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:47.190
After we've received that grace and mercy
now to be used by God, that responsibility

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.970
is not only on God, because God is
the one that gives us opportunity to

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.240
be used, but it is on us to be used.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.460
It's on us to be used, and the good part
is God gives us the power to do that.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.730
So he's challenging Timothy and all of
the readers to draw this line in the.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.130
I think of Joshua one where he says,
Choose, or it says, That's actually

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.670
at the end of Joshua, where he says,
Choose who you will serve this day.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.520
As for me in my house, we
will choose to serve the Lord.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.440
Every day, you and me are getting
an opportunity to choose the Lord

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:26.340
or ourself the Lord, or my sinful
nature the Lord, or false truths.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.300
Every single day we are faced
with these choices, and here's

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.010
what it says in verse 20.

00:18:33.255 --> 00:18:34.065
He says this.

00:18:34.335 --> 00:18:40.125
So if anyone, that word if is
so critical cuz it's not saying

00:18:40.665 --> 00:18:42.615
everyone, he says if that's a choice.

00:18:43.005 --> 00:18:48.585
So if you choose right, anyone,
Pures purifies, um, himself

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.155
from anything dishonorable, he
will be a special instrument.

00:18:52.725 --> 00:18:56.625
So if we decide to be used for
honor, We purify ourselves as

00:18:56.625 --> 00:19:00.255
verse 21 says, And even in verse
22, we flee youthful passions.

00:19:00.435 --> 00:19:02.535
So let's talk about the word purify.

00:19:03.015 --> 00:19:05.745
Um, most of you are probably used
to that if you have bad water.

00:19:05.745 --> 00:19:08.055
Well, Hamilton's known for the
greatest water in the world, so you

00:19:08.055 --> 00:19:09.255
don't have to purify that, right?

00:19:09.705 --> 00:19:15.285
Um, but purify means to remove or
extract something from our lives

00:19:15.345 --> 00:19:19.005
to remove or extract something
from our lives, and then to flee.

00:19:19.035 --> 00:19:20.385
Let me give you a great picture of.

00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:24.990
I may be dating myself here a little
bit, but who has watched Forrest Gump?

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:26.310
Okay.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.149
A lot of people have.

00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:28.469
Great, and I'm not the only one.

00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:32.820
Think of the scene where, uh, what,
what, what was the girl's name?

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.169
Gny G.

00:19:34.649 --> 00:19:36.360
Well, you know, Forrest was
getting ready to get chased

00:19:36.365 --> 00:19:38.850
by his, uh, his, uh, bullies.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.649
And he, she says, What?

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.020
Run Forst.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.320
Run.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:43.560
Good.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.780
You guys know that the,
So what does fors do?

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.879
He turns and he begins to run.

00:19:47.879 --> 00:19:50.010
Does anybody remember
what was on his legs?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.810
Braces.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.370
And, and, and what did he was he do, He
was fleeing, but he could only go so fast.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:00.570
But the more that he fled,
those braces broke off.

00:20:00.629 --> 00:20:01.649
And guess what he was?

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:06.780
He began to run quicker and
quicker away from the enemy,

00:20:07.889 --> 00:20:10.290
away from the ungodly things.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.139
And the cool part is it transitions
him growing up older and he was

00:20:13.139 --> 00:20:16.770
just this runner and ran fast and
ran all these places and it seemed

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.120
like he was always fleeing from.

00:20:19.575 --> 00:20:22.395
From things that could hold
him down and weigh him down.

00:20:22.695 --> 00:20:27.645
So when we think about this idea of
fleeing or purifying, it's running

00:20:27.645 --> 00:20:32.085
away from, and he's saying run away
from things that are dishonorable.

00:20:32.355 --> 00:20:35.385
So just based upon our teaching,
but then also in our lives, I

00:20:35.385 --> 00:20:36.764
wanna engage you a little bit.

00:20:37.155 --> 00:20:42.495
What are the things that he is
challenging us to flee and to

00:20:42.795 --> 00:20:47.175
run, or to purify ourselves from
when it comes to the dishonorable?

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.450
What are the things that he
is challenging us to flee from

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.640
or to purify ourselves from?

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.130
Uh, in, in, in regards to
the dishonorable things.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.140
What are some things, Let's
just start naming some things.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.230
Let's get practical pride.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.270
What was that?

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.290
Anger?

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.210
Somebody else say something over here.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:12.780
Selfishness.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:13.260
What?

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.600
I, I, One of you said something greed.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:16.110
Yes.

00:21:18.345 --> 00:21:18.915
What else?

00:21:19.305 --> 00:21:20.865
Slander, slander, fear.

00:21:20.925 --> 00:21:21.495
Yes.

00:21:23.175 --> 00:21:24.195
We could keep going on guys.

00:21:24.195 --> 00:21:26.685
Like there's this long list and at
times we're probably wondering like,

00:21:26.715 --> 00:21:28.665
Oh man, how do we keep up with this?

00:21:28.665 --> 00:21:30.975
How do we keep up with
running from all these things?

00:21:30.975 --> 00:21:34.245
And, and even Paul dealt with these
rights from false teaching, fighting

00:21:34.245 --> 00:21:37.305
over words, irreverent speech,
anything contrary to the word of God.

00:21:37.979 --> 00:21:42.300
Um, how do we even know how to get rid of
these things or how to avoid these things?

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.489
And then he mentions this
word, youthful passions.

00:21:44.639 --> 00:21:45.899
I started studying this a little bit.

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:49.679
Number one, you don't have to be youth
in order to have youthful passions.

00:21:49.949 --> 00:21:52.260
You can be an older person
and have youthful passions.

00:21:52.439 --> 00:21:55.229
This also when you think of it, like,
my first thought was lust, right?

00:21:55.235 --> 00:21:56.370
This is all gotta be about lust.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.540
It's not only lust.

00:21:57.659 --> 00:22:01.979
When you think about youthful passions,
he's saying also run from immature living.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.520
Lying, cheating, selfishness.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.550
These are all things you
typically see in a youthful mind.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.540
And if you're young, I'm not meaning that
it's you, but I just know as a youth,

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.129
these are the things we think of, right?

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.500
Um, and, and, and we think about this.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.159
He says, If we purify ourselves
and flee from these things will

00:22:20.165 --> 00:22:24.030
be a special instrument set apart,
useful for the master for Jesus.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.530
Um, and I started thinking about, I'm
gonna kind of change my story a little

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.210
bit from something I heard the other day.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.820
But there's somebody who's a coach
and they have a player on their

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.820
team, um, who isn't going to rehab.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.200
They have a injury, but they, they
wanna be a starter on the team, and

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.290
they're complaining to the coach that,
Why am I not starting on the team?

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.440
Why, why, why am I not even
being included in the practice?

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.330
And she's like, Well,
you're not going to rehab.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:49.800
You're, you're not.

00:22:50.324 --> 00:22:51.495
Purifying yourself.

00:22:51.554 --> 00:22:54.735
You're not helping yourself
become stronger to be used

00:22:54.735 --> 00:22:56.205
for our, our, our team.

00:22:56.475 --> 00:22:59.264
And so if you're not willing to take
that on yourself, I'm not gonna put

00:22:59.264 --> 00:23:03.614
you on the field for you to be a
part of the starting team, you would,

00:23:03.645 --> 00:23:05.264
you wouldn't be any value to me.

00:23:05.864 --> 00:23:09.584
Now, that's hard truth for her to hear
because the thing is, if, if, if she

00:23:09.584 --> 00:23:13.034
would just go and, and, and work on rehab
and work on getting better, she could

00:23:13.034 --> 00:23:14.625
possibly be part of the starting team.

00:23:15.225 --> 00:23:16.604
See, I look at this in the same way.

00:23:16.604 --> 00:23:19.425
At times we say, I wanna be used by.

00:23:20.504 --> 00:23:21.074
God used me.

00:23:21.074 --> 00:23:22.004
Why aren't you sticking me in?

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.504
Why aren't you use me for greater things?

00:23:23.504 --> 00:23:26.445
I see my friend over here, they
got the promotion and I'm being

00:23:26.445 --> 00:23:27.554
figurative here in the spiritual world.

00:23:27.945 --> 00:23:29.804
You know, they're doing great
and mighty things for God.

00:23:29.804 --> 00:23:31.965
God seems to be using them
in this area of their life.

00:23:32.115 --> 00:23:33.284
Why not me, Lord?

00:23:33.735 --> 00:23:35.084
And you know what the Lord may be saying?

00:23:35.895 --> 00:23:37.875
Well, have you purified yourself.

00:23:38.294 --> 00:23:39.675
Have you set yourself apart?

00:23:39.735 --> 00:23:44.024
Have you and mentions this word, holy
right to be set apart for the work of God?

00:23:45.495 --> 00:23:47.985
And he says this, Those
who purify themselves are.

00:23:49.725 --> 00:23:53.415
To the master, Are we being useful?

00:23:53.475 --> 00:23:58.034
Like, are we, And and that's a
challenging statement to ask yourself,

00:23:58.764 --> 00:24:02.655
Is my life reflective of someone that
he could put in the starting lineup?

00:24:03.344 --> 00:24:06.794
And, and, and I think that's good
for us to ask, not to let you

00:24:06.794 --> 00:24:11.125
defeat yourself, but to know this,
that God is with you to overcome.

00:24:11.775 --> 00:24:13.095
To be the starting team.

00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:18.165
God's with you to help you grow in your
faith and begin to purify yourself and

00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:19.905
set yourself apart for those good works.

00:24:19.905 --> 00:24:21.585
And I love this in Ephesians two 10.

00:24:21.585 --> 00:24:25.155
It says this, For we are his
workmanship created in Christ

00:24:25.155 --> 00:24:29.355
Jesus for good works, which God
prepared ahead of time for us to do.

00:24:29.925 --> 00:24:36.855
We were created for these good
works for these special services.

00:24:37.965 --> 00:24:40.455
To be honorable, to be used by the master.

00:24:40.455 --> 00:24:41.925
We were created for this.

00:24:42.165 --> 00:24:48.014
And when we refuse to purify ourselves and
to flee from things, we are not fulfilling

00:24:48.014 --> 00:24:50.054
our call that God has placed on our lives.

00:24:50.355 --> 00:24:53.115
Now, what you may be asking, Well,
does that mean I'm not saved?

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:54.794
I, I'm not dealing with that.

00:24:54.794 --> 00:24:59.655
What I would say is, is when we're not
purifying ourselves, we are walking

00:24:59.655 --> 00:25:01.064
contrary to what God has called us.

00:25:01.754 --> 00:25:06.225
This is not a salvation issue because a
lot of times, this is what I would say is

00:25:06.225 --> 00:25:08.324
a right relationship issue with our lives.

00:25:08.475 --> 00:25:11.084
So if you're wondering, well,
how do we do that perfectly?

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.625
We don't.

00:25:12.225 --> 00:25:13.514
I mess up at times.

00:25:13.514 --> 00:25:16.995
I've walked contrary to God's call
in my life and what do I experience,

00:25:16.995 --> 00:25:22.304
conviction, What do I experience God
finding some way to get my attention to

00:25:22.304 --> 00:25:24.794
draw me back because he desires to use me.

00:25:25.175 --> 00:25:26.834
But what happens sometimes we reject.

00:25:27.825 --> 00:25:30.405
Because we're afraid we reject
it because we have pride.

00:25:30.405 --> 00:25:33.435
We reject it because we're
greedy, because you name it.

00:25:33.435 --> 00:25:34.395
All the things we mentioned.

00:25:34.395 --> 00:25:38.595
Those are things that are stopping
us from saying, I, I, I want to,

00:25:38.595 --> 00:25:40.635
to be purified for, for God's work.

00:25:40.665 --> 00:25:42.075
So we have a choice.

00:25:42.765 --> 00:25:45.705
He desires all to be saved,
desires, all to be used.

00:25:46.365 --> 00:25:51.045
And on the second part of 22, it says
this, Flee from youthful passions

00:25:51.255 --> 00:25:55.175
and pursue righteousness, faith,
love, peace along with those who are.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.020
On the Lord from a pure heart.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.840
This is the part I want to,
to give you the second half.

00:26:02.429 --> 00:26:06.030
I, I, I remember giving my life to
Christ and I felt like the only thing

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.399
that I was told to do was say no to sin.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.360
Say no to youthful passions,
which is difficult.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.330
Say no to all these things
that make me ungodly.

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.210
Say no, say no, say no, and
you know that The more that I

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:19.379
said no, what did I wanna do?

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.179
I wanted to say yes.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:26.550
But I was reminded there were not to
just say no to sin, but yes to Jesus.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.750
And when I changed my thinking
to say, I'm gonna avoid this.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:31.830
So let's just give you an example.

00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:33.930
Avoid lustful situations.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.530
What am I gonna do?

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:38.700
Put my focus on Jesus and the Godly
things that he provides for me.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.250
And the more that I focus on
Jesus, the less I focus on lust.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.350
The the, the more I focus on Jesus.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.399
I was a greedy person.

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.600
I'll just tell you this.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.520
The reason why I went to college
is because I didn't wanna

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.590
be, I wanted to have money.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.890
I went to college, which was stupid cuz
I still have all these student loans.

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:53.640
So that didn't work.

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:54.390
They lied to me.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.280
Um, but I was greedy.

00:26:56.285 --> 00:26:58.680
And the thing was, I didn't, I
mean, when it came to tithing

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.050
originally, I was like, No, I don't
wanna give my money to the church.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.280
That's my money.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:07.080
And I come to realize is God gave me 100%
of the money to Stuart well, and he's

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:08.850
asked me to be faithful with 10% of it.

00:27:09.645 --> 00:27:10.545
I get to keep 90.

00:27:10.875 --> 00:27:11.595
That's awesome.

00:27:11.985 --> 00:27:15.765
And so in the midst of that faithfulness,
like God took away greediness.

00:27:15.855 --> 00:27:18.495
Now I still fight it from time
to time just like anybody else.

00:27:19.125 --> 00:27:21.915
But like when we look at this,
this is so important, important.

00:27:21.915 --> 00:27:24.255
Don't just say no to Sam,
but say yes to Jesus.

00:27:25.845 --> 00:27:31.045
And I think so many times as outsiders,
those who don't know or that know

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:32.085
Christians, here's what they think.

00:27:32.205 --> 00:27:34.155
Christians have to follow a set of rules.

00:27:34.785 --> 00:27:38.385
To not do this and not do that, and
to not do this, and to not do that.

00:27:38.385 --> 00:27:39.525
And this is what I keep saying.

00:27:39.855 --> 00:27:44.115
I wanna be more known for what
I'm for than what I'm against.

00:27:44.445 --> 00:27:45.315
And here's the reason why.

00:27:45.315 --> 00:27:47.745
People need to know, Obviously I'm
against sin and there's things,

00:27:47.985 --> 00:27:52.275
but if they don't understand that
there's something beautiful with

00:27:52.275 --> 00:27:54.315
the things that I do have, what?

00:27:54.315 --> 00:27:55.155
What are those things?

00:27:55.425 --> 00:27:57.795
Righteousness, faith, love, peace.

00:27:57.795 --> 00:27:58.635
We'll see this later on.

00:27:58.635 --> 00:28:01.025
Gentleness, if they
know those things in my.

00:28:02.535 --> 00:28:05.145
They don't have to necessarily
know I'm not for something because

00:28:05.145 --> 00:28:06.525
they already know what I'm for.

00:28:06.675 --> 00:28:11.115
Those things are good, and when they
say they want to be right, they wanna

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.815
be uh, uh, uh, basically the love.

00:28:13.815 --> 00:28:14.505
They wanna have peace.

00:28:14.505 --> 00:28:17.865
They wanna have these things, and so those
are the things that I think draw people.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.889
To Christ.

00:28:20.189 --> 00:28:23.220
So again, he says not just to
say notice in, but yes to Jesus.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.350
And so he says this to pursue.

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:28.530
And when we think about
pursuit, we think run after.

00:28:28.709 --> 00:28:31.260
Don't give up, do whatever it takes.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.659
I think about this way that every.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.120
It seemed like every day, whenever I
started dating Britney, what did I,

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:41.310
I pursued her because I desired to
know her more, and then I got married.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:42.240
And then guess what happens?

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.270
Sometimes in marriage we don't
pursue each other as much, and now

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.470
we need to do that more, right?

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.530
That's so important because if we don't,
what happens is our relationship grows

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.960
stagnant, and then we begin to wander.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.490
So that's the relationship, but we think
about Jesus, we need to pursue Jesus

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.500
so that that relationship is strong.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.800
And so when we think about
this, he says, Righteousness.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.699
What is righteousness?

00:29:02.699 --> 00:29:03.540
It's right.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:08.580
Living or lining up with what the
word of God says or who Jesus is.

00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:10.379
He mentions the word faith.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.550
What is faith?

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:16.350
Living and believing as God exists and is
going to do what he says he's going to do.

00:29:16.949 --> 00:29:17.639
Love.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:18.240
What is love?

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.199
You go love chapter.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.159
Love is patient.

00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:21.780
Kindness, long suffering.

00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:23.939
And then he mentions the word peace.

00:29:23.939 --> 00:29:27.179
Choosing to live in harmony and peace
with everyone despite our differences.

00:29:27.825 --> 00:29:31.845
See, these are things that he says
to pursue, and as we pursue them, we

00:29:31.845 --> 00:29:33.945
stop looking at those youthful lus.

00:29:34.215 --> 00:29:37.995
We stop looking at the things that are so
heavy and weighting us down, and we become

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.505
useful for the master, useful for God.

00:29:42.345 --> 00:29:47.745
And so joining in on the mission
of God is greater than the things

00:29:47.745 --> 00:29:52.245
in which we are leaving behind the
things in which sometimes hold us.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.610
I know this is that God
desires to use each one of us.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:00.540
And he mentions this, joining
those who are called, uh, from

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.800
the Lord as a in a pure heart.

00:30:01.805 --> 00:30:03.420
And you'll see that at the back end of 22.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.360
So he is saying, joining those
people who have already gone

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.070
before us, set the example.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:09.510
I'll just tell you this.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.870
It's easier for me to hit the mark when
I've seen somebody else do it before.

00:30:13.274 --> 00:30:14.534
So how do you do this?

00:30:14.895 --> 00:30:17.774
Number one, be the example so that you
can be the example for somebody else.

00:30:17.955 --> 00:30:19.995
But the word of God
challenges me every day.

00:30:19.995 --> 00:30:23.385
I look at, I look at Abraham's faith,
and yes, he had some mistakes, but

00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:25.905
I look at his faith and I go, Man,
I wish I had faith like Abraham.

00:30:26.745 --> 00:30:27.585
How did he do it?

00:30:27.945 --> 00:30:28.875
One step at a time.

00:30:28.995 --> 00:30:33.284
One decision at a time, Man, how did Paul
go through suffering and persecution?

00:30:33.284 --> 00:30:34.305
How do I do that?

00:30:34.485 --> 00:30:35.295
Man, he did it.

00:30:35.655 --> 00:30:39.065
It was difficult, but he just kept
having faith and he kept being co.

00:30:39.629 --> 00:30:44.040
He kept overcoming things and so these
people have gone before us, are great

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:48.180
examples, and then we can join them
in the mission that God has for us.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.669
So we know this, What stops us
from pursuing these things, right?

00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:57.659
To become a vessel or a person that
God can use for special things.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:00.360
And we already mentioned it,
it's sin, it's selfishness, it's

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.000
distractions, it's fear, it's Laz.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.980
But I believe that God has put
these verses in our church for

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:12.060
this time because he's reminding
us as a church why we exist.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:18.870
Why we exist, to inspire hope, to
help people overcome the strain, the

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:22.950
the, the lack of commitment to the
Lord, to inspire them, to come to know

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:28.290
Jesus, and to help them to discover a
relationship with Jesus every single day.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.810
And God is calling each one of us to do.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.080
I just wanna give you guys
this, just to kind of give you

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.280
a little bit of an example.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.910
I remember thinking back as I was
thinking of this message, that

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:40.890
this is a picture of my life.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:45.000
I remember whenever I gave my life
to Christ, um, early on giving my

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.080
life to Christ, there was a lot of
purifying that had to go on for me.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.510
Uh, and, and that was not easy.

00:31:52.095 --> 00:31:56.625
There was a lot of sins that I had to
repent of, uh, be honest with people.

00:31:56.895 --> 00:31:59.385
Uh, and, and it had some
difficult relationships.

00:31:59.505 --> 00:32:02.895
There were people that I needed
to forgive, that I hated so

00:32:02.895 --> 00:32:04.725
much that I wanted to kill.

00:32:05.175 --> 00:32:09.375
There were things that I needed to
overcome and that was difficult.

00:32:09.375 --> 00:32:11.775
It's not easy to purify yourself.

00:32:12.075 --> 00:32:16.035
It's not easy to be open and vulnerable
and lay out your sins before God

00:32:16.035 --> 00:32:19.275
and say, Forgive me, or to, to
even ask for others to forgive you.

00:32:19.515 --> 00:32:21.015
That is a humbling place.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:26.429
But I remember when I did that early on in
my faith, I believe it was the launching

00:32:26.429 --> 00:32:29.879
pad to what God did in my life after that.

00:32:30.179 --> 00:32:32.520
Because after that we started
getting more involved in the church.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:35.760
And when I got more involved in the church
and I got more involved in following

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.719
Jesus, cuz I at work, I started at middle
of the day, like during lunch I would

00:32:39.725 --> 00:32:43.860
get outta my Bible and I was reading my
Bible and it was convicting me and it was

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:47.879
reminding me of truths and my faith grew.

00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:49.889
And that's where I started seeing this.

00:32:49.889 --> 00:32:53.129
God gave me opportunity to play on
the youth band and then to help in

00:32:53.129 --> 00:32:55.080
youth and then to speak at youth.

00:32:55.379 --> 00:32:59.190
And then God gave me the opportunity
to obviously get more involved in our

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:00.510
church and more involved in our church.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:04.020
I got the more it seems like that I was
repenting of sin and I was following

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.659
God's lead and I was learning the
word of God and God gave me more and

00:33:06.659 --> 00:33:08.250
more opportunities to be used by him.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:11.700
But you know, there, there's actually
been seasons even since I've given

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:15.480
my life to Christ where I've not had.

00:33:15.899 --> 00:33:19.110
Great faith and I've, I've rejected
repenting of some things that I'm just

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.240
wrestling with because guess what?

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:23.010
Even I'm not perfect.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.120
And I think that's something we need to
know is this could be all of us where

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.679
we're struggling in a season of our
life, where at one point we had purified

00:33:31.685 --> 00:33:34.350
ourselves and we're running after Jesus
and God's used us and there's been

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.300
points where we've just fallen away.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:41.310
So I wanna just challenge you from
the word of God, that God desires

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.230
to use you for a special purpose.

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:45.330
And you can overcome these things.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:49.230
God has the ability to work in and
through you to overcome these things,

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:53.310
to receive forgiveness, to, to go after
what God has called you to go after.

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:59.160
And, um, I would say this, Paul knew
Timothy and the people he was writing

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:04.530
to, uh, and the people that Timothy
would eventually lead, had so much

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:07.230
potential, but they were getting distract.

00:34:07.814 --> 00:34:08.775
By these things.

00:34:09.165 --> 00:34:12.255
Labors getting distracted by these
things and he's challenging them and

00:34:12.255 --> 00:34:16.634
he's challenging us to, to not get
distracted anymore, that God is ready

00:34:16.634 --> 00:34:20.054
and willing to use each one of us
in this room to build his kingdom.

00:34:21.495 --> 00:34:24.824
So let's look at these last couple
of verses here, 23 through 26.

00:34:24.824 --> 00:34:27.134
I'm gonna summarize these quickly
and here's the reason why.

00:34:27.375 --> 00:34:29.475
As we begin to study through this
chapter, we've been talking a lot.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:34.470
Um, these foolish conversations are
ignorant disputes, as it says here.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.800
Um, and I just wanna summarize it rather
than to continue to just emphasize on it.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.440
But I'll just read through it
and then we'll talk through it.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.760
It says this, but reject the foolish
and ignorant disputes because you know

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.590
that they breed quarrels or fights.

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:51.780
The Lord's servant must not quarrel,
but must be gentle to everyone able

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:55.200
to teach and patient instructing
his opponents with gentleness.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.770
Perhaps God will grant them repentance,
leading them to the knowledge of the.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.930
Then they may come to their senses
and escape the trap of the devil who

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:06.000
has taken them captive to do its will.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:10.950
Here's what Paul's finally challenging
Timothy and his readers, is this

00:35:10.955 --> 00:35:15.390
idea is we have the ability to set
the example for someone's life.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.890
And if we set the example by purifying
ourselves and fall after Jesus and

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:24.750
becoming special instruments for God's
work, that we can help other people

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:28.200
come to know Jesus, repent of their
sins, and be set apart for God's.

00:35:29.385 --> 00:35:33.735
We have the ability to influence
people all around us here.

00:35:33.735 --> 00:35:34.905
Here's just the truth.

00:35:35.415 --> 00:35:39.255
You may walk in this room and think this,
God's not called me to influence people.

00:35:39.885 --> 00:35:40.905
I'm not that person.

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:41.925
I'm not an extrovert.

00:35:42.225 --> 00:35:43.635
I don't speak in front of people.

00:35:43.905 --> 00:35:45.165
I don't have that position.

00:35:45.225 --> 00:35:46.125
I work in a cubicle.

00:35:46.125 --> 00:35:47.085
I'm not around people.

00:35:47.325 --> 00:35:48.945
I'm a, I'm a stay at home mom.

00:35:48.945 --> 00:35:49.665
You name it.

00:35:49.665 --> 00:35:54.075
You may say you don't have any
influence around anybody around you.

00:35:54.255 --> 00:35:55.245
I'll just tell you this.

00:35:55.395 --> 00:35:56.295
Liar, liar, pants on.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:58.770
It's biblical.

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.690
I think it's somewhere,
somewhere in Revelation.

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:02.610
I don't know.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.480
That's wrong.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.840
So what I would say though
is think about this.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:12.150
If you would spend some time to
really understand the influence that

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:18.840
God has placed around you and the
ability to change lives for eternity.

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:19.920
Oh gosh.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.730
Like I'll just tell you this, if
you don't know it, come talk to me.

00:36:23.735 --> 00:36:25.890
I'll tell you cuz I see it in your lives.

00:36:26.535 --> 00:36:29.174
As a pastor, one of the things I
believe God has called me to do and has

00:36:29.174 --> 00:36:34.185
given me a passion to do is believe in
people and to see potential in people.

00:36:35.145 --> 00:36:35.985
I believe in you.

00:36:36.884 --> 00:36:38.055
I see potential in you.

00:36:38.595 --> 00:36:45.795
I see that God can do amazing,
great and mighty things, and I

00:36:45.795 --> 00:36:50.475
pray that I'm a person that can
set the example to encourage you

00:36:51.225 --> 00:36:52.215
to help change someone else's.

00:36:53.535 --> 00:36:55.425
I think of my friend this morning.

00:36:55.575 --> 00:36:58.395
We talked about invite cards and I'll
just go ahead and say we have a ton

00:36:58.395 --> 00:37:01.665
of invite cards over there that in the
next two months will, will be worthless

00:37:01.665 --> 00:37:04.605
cuz we're eventually gonna be moving
spaces and I'll talk more about that.

00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:06.525
We need to go invite somebody to church.

00:37:06.885 --> 00:37:08.475
You wanna know how important an invite is?

00:37:09.015 --> 00:37:11.685
Your pastor wouldn't be here today
is if my friend didn't invite me

00:37:11.685 --> 00:37:16.365
to church because my friend invited
me to church at AT in college.

00:37:17.085 --> 00:37:20.745
I went to church, spent a year there, gave
my life to Christ and the rest is history.

00:37:21.285 --> 00:37:22.065
What if he didn't invite?

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:24.720
My wife's always the sovereignty of God.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.670
He's gonna find a way to use somebody
else, and I agree to, but what if my

00:37:28.675 --> 00:37:30.660
friend didn't and somebody else did?

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.870
He would've missed out on the
story that we continually have,

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:36.690
and I continue to talk to him
about how he helped change my life.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:41.520
You would miss out on someone
else coming to faith in Christ and

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.780
being used for the glory of God.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.450
Don't miss out on that opportu.

00:37:46.695 --> 00:37:48.135
To be the example to those around you.

00:37:48.255 --> 00:37:50.325
So let's just walk through this briefly.

00:37:50.445 --> 00:37:53.565
He's saying verse 23, to
reject foolish disputes, right?

00:37:53.565 --> 00:37:56.805
Fighting and arguing cuz
it just distracts us.

00:37:57.135 --> 00:37:59.475
And he was taking that from
earlier in the chapter.

00:37:59.865 --> 00:38:03.975
But then verses 24 and 25 followers,
his Jesus basically servants or

00:38:03.975 --> 00:38:08.745
honorable vessels should not fight
and argue, but instead so replace.

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:11.430
With being gentle to everyone.

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:12.420
Why are we gentle?

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.440
Because here's what we know.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.780
When somebody gets angry,
everybody stops listening, and you

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:16.830
know what you're talking about.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.240
It happens in our marriage.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:21.690
So when we're gentle, it
seems that people listen more.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.190
What does gentleness bring?

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:29.190
It allows us to have the ability to teach
them what is right and what is wrong.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.480
It allows us to be patient with
him, even with those who are

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.070
dishonorable, who are not listening.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.940
I'm telling.

00:38:36.885 --> 00:38:39.405
Sometimes we just need to be patient
with people because they're not

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:41.475
ready to come and change their lives.

00:38:41.865 --> 00:38:45.075
But if we're patient willing
to teach gentle with them, what

00:38:45.075 --> 00:38:46.275
does he say is gonna happen?

00:38:46.665 --> 00:38:50.115
God may use you to help them
come to repentance and lead

00:38:50.115 --> 00:38:51.195
them to the knowledge of truth.

00:38:52.095 --> 00:38:54.495
He's saying this in verse 26,
and I think this is so critical.

00:38:54.795 --> 00:38:58.395
He says, Then they may come to their
senses and escape the trap of the devil

00:38:58.725 --> 00:39:00.885
who has taken them captive to do his will.

00:39:01.875 --> 00:39:05.565
I would say this, if you guys
saw today, someone trapped in a.

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.570
If you saw someone trapped in
a house with it on fire, I bet

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:11.790
the majority of you would run in
and try to find a way to help.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.530
Every day.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:15.090
There's people around you every day.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:23.790
There's people around you that are trapped
by the devil, and you have the ability as

00:39:23.795 --> 00:39:32.220
you purify yourself, set yourself apart,
pursue after God to be a part of rescuing

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.070
people, to experience the love the.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.549
Joy of God forgiveness.

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:44.370
I'll just tell you this, I am so glad
that God has invited us on that journey.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:50.310
You know, you know you've been a part
of teams where they're picking teams

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:56.580
and you're either the last one picked,
or you could be me on a baseball team

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.740
if you've been around here long enough.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:58.290
You heard my story.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.250
They never called me, and my dad
called and they didn't pick me.

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:03.120
I didn't even get to be on the.

00:40:04.965 --> 00:40:05.595
It's the cool part.

00:40:05.595 --> 00:40:06.345
God chose you.

00:40:07.665 --> 00:40:10.065
And you may say, but, but
who did he choose first?

00:40:10.065 --> 00:40:14.205
All y'all as God came for
everyone, not for just one.

00:40:14.985 --> 00:40:16.065
So you're on the starting team.

00:40:17.565 --> 00:40:19.575
I love that aspect that
we're on the starting team.

00:40:19.995 --> 00:40:23.835
So as Paul ends this chapter, he
was focusing this chapter on the

00:40:23.835 --> 00:40:27.225
opportunity for believers to be
used by God, this side of heaven.

00:40:28.635 --> 00:40:28.905
Right?

00:40:28.905 --> 00:40:30.405
I've seen it, I've experienced it.

00:40:30.405 --> 00:40:31.155
You've heard a little bit of my.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:34.110
But God has a mighty plan for all of us.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.180
And I want to ask this again.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:39.720
I ask at the beginning, Do
you wanna be used by God?

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.500
Do great and mighty things.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.480
I want you to raise your hand
again if, do you wanna be used by

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.560
God to do great and mighty things?

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.050
Again, Raise your hand
if you do raise God.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:46.890
We got at least half of you.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:49.740
Again, good news, he wants to use you too.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.290
God already knows you're his.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.820
If you already know you're his.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:54.840
Here's what he says.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.100
Turn from your wicked ways.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.630
Purify yourself, and flee from.

00:40:58.605 --> 00:41:01.154
Pursue Jesus righteousness,
faith, love, and peace.

00:41:01.365 --> 00:41:05.205
And if we do, God will use
us for a special work during

00:41:05.205 --> 00:41:06.195
this time of invitation.

00:41:06.195 --> 00:41:06.884
It's simple.

00:41:07.215 --> 00:41:10.305
I, I think sometimes I wonder if
invitation lines up perfectly to,

00:41:10.455 --> 00:41:11.955
to know what God's calling us to do.

00:41:11.955 --> 00:41:15.165
But I think it's simple today
what a God is asking you.

00:41:15.315 --> 00:41:18.945
And here's the cool part, as your
pastor, God's asking me, I'm not exempt

00:41:18.945 --> 00:41:20.384
from anything that was shared today.

00:41:21.134 --> 00:41:23.085
He's asking every one
of us to seek the Lord.

00:41:23.085 --> 00:41:23.835
Number one.

00:41:23.955 --> 00:41:24.945
This is so critical.

00:41:25.245 --> 00:41:27.295
Do I have a relationship with Jesus?

00:41:28.005 --> 00:41:31.035
Because if we don't have a
relationship with Jesus, there's no

00:41:31.035 --> 00:41:33.435
way we're gonna be able to purify
ourselves because that's only the

00:41:33.435 --> 00:41:34.845
grace of God and the mercy of God.

00:41:35.235 --> 00:41:38.025
If we don't have a relationship
with Jesus, there's no way we could

00:41:38.025 --> 00:41:41.775
pursue righteousness and love and,
and, and peace, because guess what?

00:41:41.775 --> 00:41:43.365
We don't even know what
the love of God is.

00:41:43.665 --> 00:41:45.975
So if you've never given your life
to Jesus, that's the first step.

00:41:46.785 --> 00:41:49.845
I'm always standing in the back
because I want to provide a space

00:41:49.845 --> 00:41:51.405
for you to have a quiet conversation.

00:41:51.405 --> 00:41:54.135
So if you have questions about what
it means to follow Jesus, please come

00:41:54.135 --> 00:41:55.245
back and talk to me during an in.

00:41:56.025 --> 00:42:00.135
But the rest of us, we should do
this during our time of invitation.

00:42:00.165 --> 00:42:00.855
Begin repent.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:06.180
Asking God, look into my heart and see
where I need to purify myself, how I

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:10.799
need to avoid the distracting things in
my life and begin to place God first in

00:42:10.805 --> 00:42:13.770
my life to begin to pursue godly things.

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:16.560
How do we pursue godly things through
a relationship with Jesus, through the

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.810
Word of God and around the people of God?

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:22.620
And as you do, I promise you,
here's what I promise you, God

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.640
will do exceedingly, abundantly,
more than you can ask or think.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:27.779
And here's what I.

00:42:29.175 --> 00:42:31.995
I believe God's timing is perfect.

00:42:32.625 --> 00:42:33.615
I'm, I'm, I'm gonna get out here.

00:42:33.705 --> 00:42:35.265
I believe God's timing is perfect.

00:42:35.715 --> 00:42:37.125
I'm gonna get real with every one of you.

00:42:37.875 --> 00:42:39.855
I, I wanna try to be as
real as I possibly can.

00:42:39.855 --> 00:42:41.925
This is not anything I'm just playing on.

00:42:42.135 --> 00:42:42.975
I wanna be real.

00:42:43.395 --> 00:42:46.695
I think God is ready to do
something cool in our church,

00:42:47.615 --> 00:42:48.855
and you wanna know what it is.

00:42:48.855 --> 00:42:49.605
It's not this building.

00:42:49.755 --> 00:42:50.265
It's you.

00:42:51.435 --> 00:42:53.145
It's you back there too
that's standing back there.

00:42:53.205 --> 00:42:54.705
I want you to know every one of.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:59.910
God wants to use you to be a part of this
church, to do great and mighty things.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:04.320
I cannot force you to be a part of it.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.820
I can invite you and God will not
force you to be a part of that.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:09.990
That's the thing I love about God.

00:43:09.995 --> 00:43:14.100
He does not force you, but it gives
you opportunity to be, It's your choice

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:19.740
and it's going to take linking arms,
cuz I'll just tell you this, I will

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:22.080
struggle in the days ahead sometimes to.

00:43:22.935 --> 00:43:23.865
Distractions.

00:43:24.044 --> 00:43:24.975
And you know what I need?

00:43:25.995 --> 00:43:28.725
I need a guy like James that'll grab
my arm and to say, Buddy, it's okay.

00:43:28.814 --> 00:43:29.325
I get it.

00:43:29.475 --> 00:43:31.694
Been there, but God wants to use you.

00:43:31.725 --> 00:43:34.935
Get up dust off your feet and do it again.

00:43:35.685 --> 00:43:36.765
I know you're gonna need it too.

00:43:36.765 --> 00:43:40.154
You're gonna need me to say,
Pastor, which I don't go by Pastor.

00:43:40.154 --> 00:43:40.814
Just call me Ben.

00:43:41.205 --> 00:43:44.685
Ben . Hey, I'm struggling.

00:43:45.075 --> 00:43:45.794
Can you pray for me?

00:43:45.794 --> 00:43:46.424
Can you help me?

00:43:46.904 --> 00:43:47.955
And you know what I'm gonna say?

00:43:48.105 --> 00:43:48.705
Yeah, I've been there.

00:43:49.424 --> 00:43:49.785
I'm here to.

00:43:51.375 --> 00:43:54.255
But man, I, I, I, I'm challenged by this.

00:43:54.915 --> 00:43:57.825
There was somebody today waiting on
me on the other side of my obedience

00:43:57.825 --> 00:43:58.935
to show up and preach this word.

00:43:59.715 --> 00:44:01.185
But here is the cool part.

00:44:01.485 --> 00:44:05.444
There's somebody waiting on you, on
the other side of your repentance

00:44:05.444 --> 00:44:10.335
today, your commitment to the
Lord, your ability to pursue God.

00:44:11.775 --> 00:44:13.154
Don't leave them waiting guys.

00:44:13.154 --> 00:44:14.055
Don't leave them waiting.

00:44:14.115 --> 00:44:15.645
I am ready to be at a part of something.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:19.830
because I've experienced what God has
done already in our church, and I wanna

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:25.560
be a part of something more to join me in
this time of invitation to get right with

00:44:25.565 --> 00:44:27.630
God and pursue what he's called us to do.

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:28.620
I'm gonna be standing back there.

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.550
Brittany's gonna be standing over here.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.950
If you have questions, you just need
prayer, we'd love to pray with you.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:32.820
So let's pray.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:39.760
Lord Jesus, we know you are God and we're
not, but you have invited us into the

00:44:39.765 --> 00:44:45.330
special place, into the special calling
to be a part of a greater work Lord.

00:44:46.755 --> 00:44:52.755
And God, I know that it is difficult
at times to separate ourselves from

00:44:52.755 --> 00:44:55.335
the things that are distracting us
from what you've called us to do.

00:44:56.145 --> 00:44:59.165
But God, we are asking, we're
pleading today to help us overcome

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:01.694
that through your power, through
your mercy, through your grace.

00:45:02.505 --> 00:45:06.915
Lord, let us set aside those things
and let us pursue you and come to know

00:45:06.915 --> 00:45:08.685
you more and more through your word.

00:45:09.315 --> 00:45:13.215
Um, Lord, just through creation,
through, um, other believers,

00:45:13.215 --> 00:45:14.325
Lord, allow us to just be.

00:45:15.705 --> 00:45:19.245
And Lord, as we continue to take steps
of faith as a church and as individuals,

00:45:19.245 --> 00:45:23.715
Lord, I pray that you use us for a
special work, Lord, that cannot be

00:45:23.715 --> 00:45:27.885
explained by anything other than you
working in and through our lives, Lord,

00:45:28.275 --> 00:45:33.195
as an empty vessel ready to be filled to
complete whatever you called us to do.

00:45:34.065 --> 00:45:35.295
So God use us.

00:45:35.595 --> 00:45:36.375
God change us.

00:45:36.375 --> 00:45:39.525
God forgive us, and lead us to
where you've called us to go.

00:45:39.975 --> 00:45:41.535
And Lord, we just pray
this in your heavenly name.

00:45:42.855 --> 00:45:43.154
Amen.

00:45:43.154 --> 00:45:44.835
Take some time to reflect, pray.
