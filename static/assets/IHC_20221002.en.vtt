00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.440
Answer me.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.520
All right.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.210
All right.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.650
So I just like you got very
caught up in my conversations.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.550
It's not a bad thing to get caught up
in conversations cuz it's obviously

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.440
we, we talk a lot about right.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.620
Everything we were just doing is one of my
favorite parts of our church connecting.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.260
Right.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.300
Um, so I hate pulling you
from those conversations each.

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:32.415
But I know, uh, really, if, if there's
anything, I'm probably, um, for the

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:36.855
sake of our children's workers gonna
get to the message so that, that

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.995
you guys can get your kids back.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.025
For your sake, you're like, Please, just
let us hang out here a little longer.

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:41.655
It's okay.

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:43.485
Take as long as you need.

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:45.465
So there's a balance in that, right?

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:49.485
Um, so super pumped to be back
here again with you this week.

00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:54.690
Um, We are starting what I would call
for the next couple months until,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.559
uh, Christmas time, a new series,
um, in the book of second Timothy.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.110
And if you guys will remember, it's
been a while back at the beginning

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.879
of the year, I said, Hey, this year
we're gonna walk through the book

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:04.470
of first Timothy and second Timothy.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.330
And, uh, took a little bit longer for us
to get to second Timothy, uh, to do this.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.960
So we're gonna start, obviously, we will
not finish in 2022, second Timothy, but

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.149
we'll finish at some point next year.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.740
Um, but I'm excited.

00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:18.690
I, so you guys know second Timothy.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:22.615
What we're getting ready to talk about
today is a message that I've, I say a

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.645
message, it's the text cuz I've changed
the message a couple different times.

00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:29.485
It's a text I've preached probably
three or four times, different places.

00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:32.185
Um, and I think I may have
even preached it here.

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:34.285
I couldn't find it in my notes,
so maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

00:01:34.285 --> 00:01:35.545
But it's one of my favorite texts.

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:39.595
Um, and, and there's just so much
in, in second Timothy that I really.

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.509
Believe that will be
beneficial for each one of us.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.539
And I think, you know, um, it's
kind of funny to say that cuz

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.690
isn't anything in the word of God
probably beneficial for us, but I

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.070
just think this is gonna be good.

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:52.320
Um, and so if you wanna go ahead
and turn there, we're gonna be

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.089
in second Timothy chapter one.

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:56.550
Um, we're gonna be covering
verses one through 12.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.140
And, um, as we walk through this book,
I want to kind of give you guys a little

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.370
bit of a background with this, right?

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.850
So the first book of Timothy
Paul is writing to Timothy.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.139
So Paul, the Apostle Paul, the one who,
um, was saved on the road to Damascus.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.100
God met him, right?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.450
He was the last apostle.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.770
Um, and he lived his life as a
missionary, did some amazing things,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.590
planted a ton of churches, went
on a lot of missionary journeys.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.090
Well, the cool part was Timothy.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.579
With him on a lot of
these missionary journeys.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.540
Um, and as we'll even learn hearing a
little bit, is that Timothy's grandmother

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.910
and mother led him to faith in Christ.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.310
And when Paul came to their area where
they were, he met Timothy heard about

00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:38.579
Timothy, and he invited Timothy to
come alongside him in his journeys.

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.829
And so think of Paul was a
little bit of an older man,

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.119
and Timothy is a younger man.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.500
I'd like to say I was the younger man
these days, but I'm probably now more

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.460
of the older man I feel like now, um,
when I think of this, this relationship.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.040
Um, but, but Timothy in this last
book of second Timothy here is the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.730
last book that most would believe
that Paul wrote before his death.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.299
So he was imprisoned in Rome, um,
and was heading towards certain

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.560
death, basically being persecuted
for his faith and falsely accused.

00:03:07.085 --> 00:03:10.625
And with that understanding, Paul
is pinning this letter, and we're

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:12.905
gonna see this at this point, at
some point in this letter where he

00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:14.825
tells Timothy, Hey, come and see me.

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:15.425
Right?

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:17.525
I'm sending somebody to you to kind
of take over the church that you're

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.105
doing, Come and see me, bring a
couple things with you to come see me.

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:22.325
But this letter would
be an important letter.

00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:25.895
And I think of this, um, you, you guys
know this, when somebody passes away,

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:29.945
typically if they've done their due
diligence, they've created a, a, a last,

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:31.235
you know, will and last testament, right?

00:03:31.235 --> 00:03:31.985
Something where they're gonna.

00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:34.755
Depart all of their, their
belongings to people.

00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:36.285
Maybe a last word of statement.

00:03:36.585 --> 00:03:38.955
Um, and, and usually if somebody
knows they're heading towards

00:03:38.955 --> 00:03:43.065
their, their death, their, their,
their words tend to be more direct

00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:44.385
and more pointed and important.

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:48.555
And so when we walk through this
book, I really wanna challenge you

00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:55.995
to sit at the bedside of Paul who
is about to die and think, man,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.525
these words that he is sharing.

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.160
Are important words that that meant so
much to him that he wanted to give the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.769
last part of, of, of this wisdom to
Timothy and to us before he passed away.

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:08.730
And I wanna ask this question.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.359
What's the difference
between knowledge and wisdom?

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.269
What's the difference
between knowledge and wisdom?

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.320
Okay, that's good.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.039
What else?

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.820
Keep go, Keep going.

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:26.294
Correct.

00:04:26.325 --> 00:04:28.965
So that would probably be even more of
the connection that we're looking at here.

00:04:28.965 --> 00:04:32.115
So every day, every one of
us is gaining knowledge.

00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:32.474
Right.

00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:35.565
So no matter what you're doing, you're
learning something new, you're, you're,

00:04:35.565 --> 00:04:36.675
you're, you're gaining knowledge.

00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:42.255
At some point, you take that knowledge
and you now apply it correctly, right?

00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:44.235
Wisdom is the right
application of knowledge.

00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:47.775
And so think of Timothy spending
a ton of time with Paul.

00:04:48.165 --> 00:04:49.185
Lot of information.

00:04:49.185 --> 00:04:52.094
I think of this like at college you
get a ton of information and most of

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.475
us get out into the career and we go.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.290
What portion of that am I gonna
actually use and turn into wisdom?

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.850
Cuz the majority of it we
feel like is worthless.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.180
Sorry.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.520
That's the truth with I
feel my college education.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.850
Right.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.850
But this is what Timothy is
going to learn is wisdom.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.420
The right application of what Paul
has taught him all these years.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.360
And so these words that Paul's
gonna remind Timothy have are

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.840
critical words for him and for us.

00:05:14.085 --> 00:05:17.294
And so if we think about Timothy,
remember Timothy was a pastor.

00:05:17.294 --> 00:05:20.925
He was leading a church,
he was facing persecution.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.445
Timothy was known to be timid, right?

00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:24.825
And that's, we, we kinda
learned about this.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.724
And I kind of relate with Timothy
because at times I just wanna stand back.

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:33.195
I don't wanna be, um,
basically bold at times.

00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:37.515
And, uh, so because of that, Paul
wanted to challenge Timothy and his

00:05:37.515 --> 00:05:39.135
faith and remind him of a few things.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.300
And so let's lean in today and, and, and
really hear from Paul as he's writing this

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.930
text and starting off this letter, and
hopefully each one of us will walk outta

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.240
here changed and learn something new.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.650
So let's jump into the text again.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.630
Second Timothy chapter one.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.480
Verse one says this, Paul, an apostle
of Christ Jesus by God's will, for the

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.810
sake of the promise of life in Christ
Jesus to Timothy, my dearly loved son.

00:06:07.185 --> 00:06:12.224
Grace, mercy, and peace from God the
Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:18.375
I thank God whom I serve with the clear
conscience as my ancestors did when I

00:06:18.855 --> 00:06:23.325
constantly remember you in my prayers
night and day, remembering your tears.

00:06:23.325 --> 00:06:25.995
I long to see you so that
I may be filled with joy.

00:06:26.474 --> 00:06:30.045
I recall the sincere faith that
first lived in your grandmother

00:06:30.045 --> 00:06:34.335
Lois, and in your mother Eunice,
and now I'm convinced isn't you.

00:06:35.805 --> 00:06:41.115
Therefore I re I remind you to
rekindle the gift of God that is in

00:06:41.115 --> 00:06:43.155
you through the lane on in my hands.

00:06:43.305 --> 00:06:47.085
For God has not given us a
spirit of fear, but one of power

00:06:47.085 --> 00:06:48.505
and love and sound judgment.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.790
So do not be ashamed of the testimony
about our Lord or of me, his prisoner.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.590
Instead, sharing the sufferings for the
gospel, relying on the power of God.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.190
He has saved us and called
us with his holy calling.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.820
Not according to our works, but
according to his own purpose and

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.820
grace, which was given to us in
Christ Jesus before time began.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.380
This has now been.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.100
Evident through the appearing of
our savior, Christ Jesus, who has

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.460
abolished death and has brought
life, and Im mortality to light

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.530
through the gospel for this gospel.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.120
I was appointed to Harold and Apostle
and a teacher, and this is why I suffer

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.950
these things, but I am not ashamed
because I know whom I have believed and

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.750
persuaded that he is able to guard what
has been entrusted to me until that.

00:07:35.465 --> 00:07:36.035
So let's pray.

00:07:36.035 --> 00:07:38.465
Lord Jesus, we pray Lord,
that our hearts are open.

00:07:38.705 --> 00:07:40.385
Our minds are open, Lord, to your word.

00:07:40.715 --> 00:07:44.345
May it change our lives, Lord,
today and for every day after.

00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:45.545
And we pray this in your heaven name.

00:07:45.935 --> 00:07:46.295
Amen.

00:07:47.525 --> 00:07:51.215
So the first and most powerful
words that Paul shared with Timothy

00:07:51.665 --> 00:07:54.155
was his love and care for Timothy.

00:07:54.545 --> 00:07:57.425
Um, what I look at this text and
today I'm hoping you'll be able to

00:07:57.425 --> 00:08:00.965
see what I see in this is it's so
important that as we study guys' work

00:08:00.965 --> 00:08:02.525
cuz here's my hope, here's my hope.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.255
Sundays is not the only day
that you're in God's word.

00:08:07.005 --> 00:08:08.804
And if it is, here's my challenge.

00:08:10.005 --> 00:08:11.114
Let that change tomorrow.

00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:12.674
How do you change?

00:08:12.674 --> 00:08:15.044
I'm, I'm just gonna take
a second to jump off here.

00:08:15.255 --> 00:08:19.395
How do you change getting in God's word
tomorrow if you don't have a Bible back?

00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:21.284
There is Bibles on the,
the next steps table.

00:08:21.284 --> 00:08:24.375
You could start there if you
don't wanna paper Bible download.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.760
The Bible app, right?

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:27.720
And start a Bible plan.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.520
It's one of the simplest
things to get in the word.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.710
Allow the word of God
to teach you every day.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.450
My challenge, don't miss.

00:08:34.275 --> 00:08:34.365
Okay.

00:08:34.365 --> 00:08:34.934
That's a side note.

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:35.355
Okay.

00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:39.765
But I wanna really walk through this in
a way that makes sense and how I even

00:08:39.765 --> 00:08:43.664
think through the message and how I begin
to ask questions and pull things out.

00:08:43.934 --> 00:08:47.985
And the first thing we see here, really
in the first, uh, couple of verses, we

00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:51.855
see this in the second verse, it says
to Timothy, My dearly love son, right?

00:08:51.855 --> 00:08:54.615
So the first, most, uh, important
words that Paul shared was

00:08:54.615 --> 00:08:56.115
his love and care for Timothy.

00:08:56.954 --> 00:08:58.844
To call Timothy his dearly loved son.

00:08:58.844 --> 00:09:02.685
Most would believe that Paul
did not have a son himself, and

00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:04.365
Timothy did not have a father that.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.449
A model for him, as we see his faith is
brought back to his grandmother and his

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:11.010
mother, so we're making these assessments.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.230
Timothy doesn't really
have a fatherly example.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.430
Paul doesn't have a son, true
son, and so Paul looks at Timothy

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.110
as his true son in the faith.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.870
He says, My dearly loved son.

00:09:22.605 --> 00:09:24.135
And so that would make sense.

00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:26.925
Timothy's spending a ton of time with
Paul on these missionary journeys.

00:09:27.075 --> 00:09:28.245
He's learned a lot from Paul.

00:09:28.245 --> 00:09:31.225
Paul's invested in him, and so
I would even say this, that that

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.885
Timothy would look at Paul as
his dearly loved father, right?

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.115
His spiritual father.

00:09:35.895 --> 00:09:40.755
And so from Timothy's perspective
to receive a letter while Timothy's

00:09:40.785 --> 00:09:44.895
leading a church where he's maybe
getting afraid, he's dealing with

00:09:45.045 --> 00:09:46.605
difficult people in the church.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.829
He's seen his dearly loved father
who's probably getting ready to

00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:52.860
die and received this letter, had
to be an encouragement to him.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.300
So the words in which Paul would pin
would be important words to him, and

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.840
the first thing that Paul says is not
Go do this, go do that and go do that.

00:10:01.079 --> 00:10:06.180
The first words that Paul says is, I'm
writing this to my dearly loved son.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:07.560
I does.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.319
Anybody enjoy at times to to
hear somebody that's close to

00:10:10.319 --> 00:10:11.280
you say that they love you?

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:12.829
That means a lot to me.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.890
I mean, there's people in my life that
they just, they genuinely say, and I

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.190
would even say this, my, my youngest
son, Sterling, um, a lot of times, um,

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.540
I just love hearing him say he loves me.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.130
And so I'll say, Buddy, I love you.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.540
And he says, Love you too, dad.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.790
Just the way he says
it just melts my harm.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.220
So I think about that word love.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.850
Paul could have used any word,
but he says, My dearly loved son.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.300
So this word that he's
writing to him is so, I.

00:10:37.815 --> 00:10:39.135
And so we see it.

00:10:39.135 --> 00:10:41.595
Also, he continues on in
verse three, right, is how?

00:10:41.595 --> 00:10:43.845
How did Paul show his love to Timothy?

00:10:44.385 --> 00:10:48.915
He says this, I thank God whom I
serve with the clear conscience as my

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:53.295
ancestors did when I constantly remember
you and my prayers day and night.

00:10:53.625 --> 00:10:57.315
So just kind of seeing the beginning and
the end of this verse, we see that Paul

00:10:57.315 --> 00:11:00.915
thinks God daily and nightly for Timothy.

00:11:01.605 --> 00:11:03.585
He remembers him in his prayers.

00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:05.655
I think that's important.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.840
Because I would say this, a sign
that somebody truly cares for you

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.920
is somebody who prays for you.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.780
They're going before God
and they're saying on, on

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.180
basically this person's behalf.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.560
I care about them so much.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.930
God, I see what they're going through.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.250
I know the life that they live and the the
battles they face, and I am bringing them

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.520
before God every single day and night.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.980
That, that to me shows love.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:32.790
I don't know about you guys.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.080
Anybody had somebody pray for you?

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.040
Anybody?

00:11:36.689 --> 00:11:38.970
Now I want you to name somebody
that you know has prayed for you.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.650
Somebody just name somebody
that you know prayed for you.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.089
Your mom.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.780
Who else?

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.189
Your mom.

00:11:44.189 --> 00:11:44.550
Great.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:45.540
Who else has prayed for you?

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:47.819
Your dad.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:48.839
Who else?

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.199
Me.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.589
Hey, thanks grandma.

00:11:54.689 --> 00:11:55.380
What else?

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.939
Who else?

00:11:56.939 --> 00:11:57.689
Couple more people.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:58.770
Who's prayed for you?

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.560
Yeah, the church.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.160
Absolutely.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.770
Your brothers best.

00:12:06.165 --> 00:12:09.915
When's the last time that you thank
that person for praying for you?

00:12:11.505 --> 00:12:15.525
Because if your friends, your
family, your church family prays

00:12:15.525 --> 00:12:18.855
for you, that's a sign of love.

00:12:19.574 --> 00:12:24.735
And, and, and it's because they, they care
so much about you, and they know God wants

00:12:24.735 --> 00:12:29.204
to hear the needs that you have in your
life, that they're bringing your care.

00:12:29.835 --> 00:12:32.295
Your trials, your issues,
your burden, whatever it is.

00:12:32.295 --> 00:12:34.755
Maybe it's just a blessing
over your life before God.

00:12:35.235 --> 00:12:36.705
And so we see Paul doing that.

00:12:37.035 --> 00:12:40.095
He shows his love and care for
Timothy by praying for him.

00:12:40.905 --> 00:12:43.215
And I believe that that is
something that's so important.

00:12:43.215 --> 00:12:46.935
And so when you know that someone
has prayed for you, my encouragement

00:12:47.775 --> 00:12:50.235
is that today the people that you
just mentioned, when you leave

00:12:50.235 --> 00:12:51.165
outta here today, you should.

00:12:52.275 --> 00:12:53.385
Thank you for praying for me.

00:12:53.745 --> 00:12:54.435
You wanna know why?

00:12:55.035 --> 00:12:56.714
Because I truly believe
this is not just for me.

00:12:56.714 --> 00:12:57.974
I think this is the same thing for you.

00:12:58.275 --> 00:13:03.885
I am who I am today because the result
of someone else's answered prayer because

00:13:03.885 --> 00:13:05.834
someone else choose to pray for me.

00:13:05.895 --> 00:13:07.454
I am who I am today.

00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:08.984
My wife is one of those.

00:13:08.984 --> 00:13:10.035
She's prayed for me a lot.

00:13:10.035 --> 00:13:12.255
She tells me a lot of times
when I say, Hey, pray for me.

00:13:12.255 --> 00:13:13.694
She says, Oh, already done.

00:13:13.964 --> 00:13:15.015
I pray for you a lot.

00:13:15.344 --> 00:13:18.795
I believe I am standing here today
because of her faithful prayer.

00:13:19.545 --> 00:13:21.675
Like that's big.

00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:24.255
And I know we're trying to connect
this back to the text, but I want

00:13:24.255 --> 00:13:28.605
you to see this Paul's first thing
was one, you're my dearly loved son.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.745
Two, I pray for you.

00:13:30.585 --> 00:13:34.875
Those were huge words for Timothy
in a time that would be difficult.

00:13:35.505 --> 00:13:37.935
And so if you've ever dealt with
difficult times and you know somebody

00:13:37.935 --> 00:13:41.715
prays for you, Man, one, appreciate that.

00:13:41.715 --> 00:13:44.385
But two, tell him how thankful you are.

00:13:44.745 --> 00:13:45.825
I know this as a church.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.075
I've had many people reach out
to me and say that you're praying

00:13:48.075 --> 00:13:50.895
for me, and I know I'm standing up
here today because of you as well.

00:13:51.105 --> 00:13:52.935
And so I thank you because of that.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.175
Right?

00:13:53.175 --> 00:13:57.465
So Paul was expressing his love
and his care for Timothy, not only

00:13:57.465 --> 00:14:01.785
to just say, Hey, I love you, but
he's also expressing it as a model.

00:14:02.385 --> 00:14:04.635
Of faith, a model of
who he should be, right?

00:14:04.785 --> 00:14:06.345
These last words are so important.

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:10.545
Every word that Paul speaks is an
example to Timothy to follow, and so

00:14:10.545 --> 00:14:17.505
he's really showing Timothy, you should
love others, you should pray for others,

00:14:17.925 --> 00:14:19.425
and I, I love this thought, love.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.330
Inspires love.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.560
Love inspires love.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.750
So Romans five eight says this, but God
proves his own love for us and that while

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.020
we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.530
I want you to think about this
because of Jesus' love for Paul,

00:14:34.535 --> 00:14:36.360
it inspired Paul to love others.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.300
Love inspires others to love.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.260
And so he was challenging.

00:14:42.265 --> 00:14:45.780
He was hopefully inspiring
Timothy to love others even in

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.220
the difficult circumstances.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:47.760
He was.

00:14:48.825 --> 00:14:52.275
And it reminds me this, right, that
Paul didn't keep his love to himself,

00:14:52.995 --> 00:14:55.275
but he gave it to someone else.

00:14:55.575 --> 00:14:58.215
Love was not meant to be
kept, but to be given.

00:14:58.335 --> 00:15:00.615
And I remember I was thinking
about it this morning as I was, I

00:15:00.615 --> 00:15:02.595
was praying through this message
and thinking through this message.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.960
The first time that this made total sense
to me was when I was young in my faith.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.050
It was the first time I ever went on a
mission trip to Africa, and I remember

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:13.560
going on this mission trip with music
minister there at our church, and

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.560
uh, we were going out door to door,
which I laugh about this in Africa.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.670
It's like hut to hut.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.969
To, to share the gospel and
just connect with people, see

00:15:20.969 --> 00:15:21.540
if we could pray with them.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.839
And we came to this group of kids who
were selling these like little sim cards

00:15:24.839 --> 00:15:26.280
that you could get more minutes for.

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:27.990
And we says, Hey, can we share with you?

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.579
Well, we could just share
the gospel with them.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.569
Um, and we had a translator and I
remember him saying this statement.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:38.130
He said, We had been given the
gospel, the good news of Jesus.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:43.439
And God has reminded us that we are not
to keep this good news to ourselves, but

00:15:43.439 --> 00:15:46.530
we have been given it to give to others.

00:15:47.325 --> 00:15:51.795
So I think about that and I think
the love that Paul shared to Timothy

00:15:52.275 --> 00:15:55.245
and the prayers that he prayed for
Timothy were not meant for Timothy

00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:57.345
just to keep and say Thank you, Lord.

00:15:57.765 --> 00:16:01.425
But it was meant for Timothy to
learn, grab, hold of, and in turn love

00:16:01.425 --> 00:16:04.545
others, and in turn, pray for others.

00:16:04.545 --> 00:16:06.705
And I wanna remind us what
does it mean to love others?

00:16:06.855 --> 00:16:11.415
It's not only loving those who are nice
to you, sorry, it's not only loving

00:16:11.415 --> 00:16:13.935
those who bless you and love you first.

00:16:14.445 --> 00:16:15.345
See, here's what love is.

00:16:15.345 --> 00:16:17.745
Love is first Corinthians
13, fourth through eight.

00:16:17.745 --> 00:16:18.915
Love is patient.

00:16:19.215 --> 00:16:20.325
Oh gosh, I need that.

00:16:20.595 --> 00:16:21.765
Love is kind.

00:16:22.035 --> 00:16:23.475
Love is not envy.

00:16:23.835 --> 00:16:25.005
It's not boastful.

00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:26.265
It's not arrogant.

00:16:26.475 --> 00:16:27.585
It's not rude.

00:16:27.735 --> 00:16:28.905
It's not self-seeking.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:29.835
It's not irritable.

00:16:30.449 --> 00:16:31.740
Man, I need to hear this more.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:32.370
I need that.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.660
Um, it's not, uh, it says it
does not keep a record of wrongs.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.500
Love finds no joint unrighteousness,
but rejoices in truth.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.640
It bears all things, believes all things,
hopes all things, and endures all things.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.720
And I love this last part.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.459
Love never ends.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.480
See, the love that Paul was
expressing was an important love.

00:16:51.485 --> 00:16:56.760
And so this powerful charge that Timothy
was gonna receive from, from, from Paul

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.130
started with Paul showing love and.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.260
Praying for him, modeling how important
it was to show his love to him.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:09.660
Here's what I want you to think though
about this, is that, is it easier

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.579
to hear something from someone when
they've shown love and care for you?

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.970
Or is it easier when somebody just comes
right up to you and then they start

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.359
challenging you to go do something like
you just need to be better, you need to

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.629
go live your faith out, or you need to do,
Do you receive it better when somebody,

00:17:24.629 --> 00:17:28.200
you know somebody cares for you, or do you
receive it better whenever you don't know?

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:30.270
You ready?

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.360
Okay, let me just the first one.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:33.840
Okay.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.870
I mean, I don't know if you've
ever had a boss come in and

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.790
you've done all this work for 'em.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.550
You've done all the work for the
company and rather than them coming

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.440
in and saying, Man, thank you so
much for what you've been doing.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.370
You've been knocking outta the park.

00:17:44.375 --> 00:17:45.660
All they do is give you another task.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:46.770
Here's another one.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:51.180
Deadlines next week kind of frustrates
you a little bit because not that

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.260
like, you know, you did a good
job, but like it's nice to know.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.669
That, that you did a good job and, and
so when you know, man, thank you so much.

00:17:59.669 --> 00:18:01.379
Just keep knocking outta the park.

00:18:01.379 --> 00:18:02.399
You're doing an amazing job.

00:18:02.399 --> 00:18:04.500
If there's anything I can do
to help, I'm here for you.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.450
Hey, here's another one next week.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.590
And you're like, pumped, right?

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.080
So I look at this same thing here.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.919
Paul is not setting Timothy up as Louis
trying to pull something outta Timothy's.

00:18:13.919 --> 00:18:16.439
Really just what I would
say is being genuine, right?

00:18:16.889 --> 00:18:19.800
And so I would look at this, that we
need to show people that we love them

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.790
first, that we pray for them first
before we start challenging them.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.620
In their lives or in their faith.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.050
And we're gonna see this where Timothy
is, is sharing the second thing.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.970
So the second thing,
sorry, that Paul's sharing.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.380
So the second thing that Paul
shares, uh, to Timothy is to remind

00:18:34.385 --> 00:18:36.270
him of his faith and gift from God.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.310
These verses are some
of my favorite verses.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.280
So you know, if you wanna know, Hey,
what are some of Pastor Ben's favorite

00:18:41.285 --> 00:18:42.810
verses, It's five through seven.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.830
So let's read these together.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.490
He says, I recall your sincere.

00:18:48.675 --> 00:18:51.764
That first lived in your grandmother
Lois, and in your mother units.

00:18:51.764 --> 00:18:53.235
I don't even know if I'm
saying their names right.

00:18:53.625 --> 00:18:56.145
And now I'm convinced as in also you.

00:18:56.804 --> 00:18:59.354
He says, Therefore I remind you to
rekindle the gift that God has given

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.705
you through the lane outta my hands.

00:19:00.709 --> 00:19:03.975
For God has not given you a spirit of
fear, but a power and love and some mind.

00:19:03.975 --> 00:19:05.415
So let's walk through these verses, right?

00:19:05.715 --> 00:19:09.314
So after we reminds him that he
loves him, he begins to challenge

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:14.235
him, he begins to challenge him,
and he says he reminds him of his.

00:19:15.825 --> 00:19:20.925
See, I'll tell you this, like in
the moment I celebrate whenever I've

00:19:20.925 --> 00:19:25.155
lived my faith out and I'm like doing
good, but like the next day I forget.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.665
Do you guys tend to forget, like sometimes
your faith and what God's done for you

00:19:28.665 --> 00:19:31.215
and, and really how your life's changed?

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:32.265
I know it's easy.

00:19:32.415 --> 00:19:33.435
It's easy to forget.

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:35.895
So what is Paul doing?

00:19:35.895 --> 00:19:37.695
He's reminding him of his.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.439
Because it's so easy to forget.

00:19:40.439 --> 00:19:44.010
And so, but reminding Timothy of the
roots of his faith, Paul was trying

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.909
to strengthen and encourage Timothy
and the face of the persecution

00:19:47.915 --> 00:19:51.840
that he would, he was having and
would have after Paul's death.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.590
So he knew how important it
was to say, Hey, remember.

00:19:56.129 --> 00:19:58.649
Remember what I would say your why.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:59.970
We talked a lot about this.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.030
Me and Brittany, whenever I go, you
go into church planning, you, If you

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.010
don't remember your why, you'll give up.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.500
We would've given up a long time
ago, but you gotta remember your why.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.690
You're not here for, you know, all
these, these, you know things where

00:20:12.695 --> 00:20:15.659
people will, will run around and tell
you, you're doing an amazing job.

00:20:15.659 --> 00:20:18.270
Are these big churches or whatever
you want to dream of, you're.

00:20:19.199 --> 00:20:23.189
Because of the why, because God so
changed your life that you can't

00:20:23.189 --> 00:20:27.480
help but go and share how God can
change others no matter who that is.

00:20:27.899 --> 00:20:32.399
So Paul was really reminding Timothy
of his why, his faith, where he was

00:20:32.405 --> 00:20:34.409
saved from and what he was saved to.

00:20:35.459 --> 00:20:39.300
So Paul knew that Timothy's inspiration
to fulfill his call would only come

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.800
from remembering his faith in Jesus.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:46.020
And let me just say this directly
to you, the only thing that will

00:20:46.024 --> 00:20:47.530
inspire you to go live your faith.

00:20:48.014 --> 00:20:52.455
Will be your faith that you came through
Jesus and what Jesus did in your life.

00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:56.685
I can sit up here every day and try
to motivate you all day long, but my

00:20:56.685 --> 00:21:01.334
motivation is worthless apart from really
reminding you of your faith in Jesus,

00:21:01.695 --> 00:21:06.435
because if Jesus changing your life hasn't
motivated you enough, what I'm giving you

00:21:06.435 --> 00:21:09.675
is, I'm telling you, it's, it's useless
because what we're gonna le learn here

00:21:09.885 --> 00:21:14.895
is that God's faith in you and the faith
that you have through him is power.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.130
It is powerful, more powerful
than anything that I could give.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:24.420
And so I want to continue to remind you,
just as Paul did, remember your faith.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.100
Remember what God's done for you.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.890
And maybe you're wondering, maybe
God hasn't changed your life.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.450
Maybe you haven't given
your life to Christ.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.890
Let me challenge you with this.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:37.560
God can, God can, you can receive him
today, and you can turn from your sins

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:42.750
and you can accept the faith that he has
for you, and you can begin to experience.

00:21:43.545 --> 00:21:44.535
That's the cool part.

00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:48.495
So as he's reminding Timothy of
his faith, he's challenging him.

00:21:48.495 --> 00:21:52.335
If you'll be grounded in what God has
done for you, you, and remember what

00:21:52.335 --> 00:21:56.325
God has done for you, you'll be able
to persevere through these difficult

00:21:56.325 --> 00:21:57.675
times and live out your faith.

00:21:58.095 --> 00:22:00.855
So as he's reminding him, as his faith,
this is where we get to verse six.

00:22:01.035 --> 00:22:05.775
He reminds Timothy of his gift,
his gift, and so does any,

00:22:05.805 --> 00:22:06.855
Does anybody realize this?

00:22:06.855 --> 00:22:07.665
Like outside?

00:22:07.665 --> 00:22:09.615
Obviously we've been
received the gift of s.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:11.580
We're saved.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:16.320
But did you know that God has given
you a gift to live out your faith?

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.950
There's something inside of you
that's unique, that, and how you

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.010
live out your faith, that you can
change the lives of others, you

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.150
can change the lives of others.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.440
And that's what he's speaking of here.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.050
He says, I remind you
to rekindle the gift.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.860
So what Paul is saying is Timothy, at
some point understood that he had a gift.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.160
He has the gift of of a shepherd,
Obviously he's a pastor, right?

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.100
He has the gift of, you know, we
don't fully know all of his gifts.

00:22:38.105 --> 00:22:38.700
Maybe a gift of.

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:44.594
And Timothy's probably been timid lately,
which means he's kind of let the fire,

00:22:44.594 --> 00:22:46.004
Has anybody been in a campfire lately?

00:22:46.875 --> 00:22:47.655
Overnight.

00:22:47.659 --> 00:22:51.344
Unless you just stay up all night,
your fire goes from a big flame down

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.445
to like small little coals, right?

00:22:53.715 --> 00:22:57.284
Sometimes our faith, he's
down to small little coals.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:01.125
You can't even say see him and he's
saying rekindle and I, Here's the

00:23:01.125 --> 00:23:04.725
thing, I love rekindling my faith,
but the thing is I'm impatient.

00:23:04.754 --> 00:23:07.754
So a lot of times if I'm out near pine
needles, I throw 'em on and they go.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.890
I'm like, Yeah, my faith's
rekindled, and then it goes away.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.420
So he's actually staying, start
building, start, start adding some twigs

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.060
and, and some bigger sticks as well.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.330
Then maybe you start putting those
pine needles underneath and, and then

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:26.280
beginning to build up that flame, and
then it begins to really be on fire again.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.630
So each one of us has been given a
gift just like Timothy and Timothy

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.400
has been neglecting his gift.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.930
And this gift is not just for
Timothy, it was meant for the church.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.240
It was meant for the church.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:43.620
And so the people around Timothy and
in his church that he was leading

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.500
was needing him to fan and inflame
the gift that God was giving him.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.090
Think about this.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:52.050
When we're neglecting our gift, we may
not be neglecting something that benefits

00:23:52.055 --> 00:23:57.080
necessarily us because our salvation's
secure, but it's not benefiting

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.280
those around you who knows this.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.400
The bigger the flame at a
campfire, the more you can.

00:24:03.765 --> 00:24:08.715
The bigger the flame that you have fanned
in your life, where you live, in your

00:24:08.715 --> 00:24:14.755
job, in your home, in your day to day
life, allows other people to see Jesus.

00:24:16.425 --> 00:24:20.085
But when we allow it to die out
and we aren't living out our faith,

00:24:21.285 --> 00:24:22.785
we've really kept it to ourselves.

00:24:23.045 --> 00:24:25.995
We, we really are missing the
greatest thing, as Timothy

00:24:25.995 --> 00:24:27.855
was missing that in the story.

00:24:28.095 --> 00:24:29.235
So Paul encouraged him.

00:24:30.195 --> 00:24:34.245
But then he also wanted to
remind him to rekindle that gift.

00:24:36.075 --> 00:24:39.615
And I know this, if we look at Timothy's
life, he easily could be discouraged

00:24:39.615 --> 00:24:43.605
because his father and, and, and what
he would say is his, his father in faith

00:24:44.385 --> 00:24:46.425
was, was going to die soon for his faith.

00:24:46.935 --> 00:24:48.825
So anybody here ever gotten discouraged?

00:24:49.335 --> 00:24:50.385
You get discouraged at time.

00:24:50.955 --> 00:24:52.515
You, you, you think,
Man, I can't do anything.

00:24:52.515 --> 00:24:52.845
Right.

00:24:52.875 --> 00:24:53.145
I.

00:24:53.729 --> 00:24:55.860
I, I'm never gonna share
my faith like I need to.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.770
And man, I, it's a struggle to live
the life that God's called me to.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:24:59.879
We, we get discouraged.

00:25:00.449 --> 00:25:01.110
Good news.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.860
You're not the only one.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.419
Timothy was that same way.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:07.560
But even though Timothy was that same
way, he didn't stay there because

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.330
of Paul's encouragement, right?

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.790
First Peter Forten says this as each one
is received a gift, use it to serve one

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:17.520
another as good stewards of varied grace.

00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:22.380
So my challenge to you, We've been
saying this a little bit lately and

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.840
we have some shirts that are coming
out, but God's not done with you.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:26.490
God's not done with you.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.850
If you think, Man, my flame's
gone out, and man, I just can't

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.400
do anything right and I'm just
so defeated, I'm so discouraged.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:38.340
May today, Paul's words be part
of the breath that fans the flame.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.220
Cuz sometimes what we've gotta do,
we gotta blow on the flame, man.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:46.620
He blow on the flame in your life
and to begin to rekindle and restart.

00:25:47.235 --> 00:25:50.625
And be a part of changing the
lives of those around you.

00:25:51.975 --> 00:25:55.605
And here's what happens, because I, I
just, I'm gonna sit out there with you.

00:25:56.085 --> 00:26:03.314
What if the fan, the flame is rekindled,
what's gonna happen because Paul

00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:04.635
was getting killed for his faith?

00:26:04.935 --> 00:26:06.284
Am I gonna be persecuted?

00:26:06.784 --> 00:26:07.345
Maybe.

00:26:07.784 --> 00:26:08.955
And this is what usually happens.

00:26:08.955 --> 00:26:10.125
Verse seven tells us this.

00:26:10.425 --> 00:26:13.274
He said, For God has not given
us a spirit of fear, but of power

00:26:13.274 --> 00:26:14.564
and love and sound judgment.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.719
Paul knew that Timothy, if I fan
up, you know, my flame gets bigger.

00:26:19.409 --> 00:26:22.110
I'm probably, I, I'm really
afraid of what's gonna happen.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.969
Who's gonna say something to me?

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:27.659
What if this happens or what if my
life begins to change and I begin to

00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:31.530
have to change different priorities in
my life in order to follow after God?

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.990
I'm afraid, I don't know what it is.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:37.050
Maybe you're afraid of things,
but fear was stopping probably

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:37.979
Timothy from using his.

00:26:39.225 --> 00:26:40.845
And I love this statement by Matthew West.

00:26:40.845 --> 00:26:42.555
It's a song he makes this statement.

00:26:42.555 --> 00:26:46.485
He says, We spend our lives at the
intersection of faith and fear.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.515
So, you know, faith and fear are
two different ends of the spectrum.

00:26:50.295 --> 00:26:51.585
They cannot be together.

00:26:51.585 --> 00:26:53.655
Faith and fear are separate, right?

00:26:53.805 --> 00:26:56.925
And he says this, We spend our lives
at the intersection of faith and fear.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.504
Which way we go from here?

00:26:59.504 --> 00:27:00.945
We'll define our destination.

00:27:02.475 --> 00:27:04.215
You know, every day we're faced with.

00:27:04.949 --> 00:27:06.840
Every day we're faced with fear.

00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:08.730
You don't even have to look for it.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:09.600
It's there.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:15.240
But we have the choice at that point to
choose faith, that God is going to work

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.830
in your life despite the circumstances
around you, despite how difficult it is.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:24.000
Despite if what if somebody says something
or does something I lose a friend or

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.959
how the change my, my folks, Whatever
it is that, that, what will God do?

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:28.860
We had to choose.

00:27:28.919 --> 00:27:33.840
Choose faith, and so the enemy
likes to use fear against us.

00:27:34.245 --> 00:27:36.705
And I remember this statement I saw,
and you guys are gonna laugh about this.

00:27:36.705 --> 00:27:38.685
We, when we went to, um, St.

00:27:38.685 --> 00:27:42.495
Louis, we stopped at a restaurant and went
in the restroom and I'm gonna the restroom

00:27:42.495 --> 00:27:44.445
and not, I'm not even descriptive here.

00:27:44.715 --> 00:27:48.285
Um, Channing's like waiting on one of
the stalls and he starts reading this

00:27:48.285 --> 00:27:50.175
quote and I'm like, Oh, that sounds good.

00:27:50.175 --> 00:27:52.935
And so like, I just stuck in my head
and, and it was from Will Rogers.

00:27:52.935 --> 00:27:56.715
He says, Worry is like paying
a debt that may never be due.

00:27:57.585 --> 00:28:00.975
Worry is like paying a
debt that may never be due.

00:28:01.605 --> 00:28:02.385
Fear.

00:28:03.435 --> 00:28:08.534
And succumbing to fear is like pain, a
debt that may never come due and, and it's

00:28:08.534 --> 00:28:11.774
crazy at how fearful we get as believers.

00:28:13.274 --> 00:28:15.705
My challenge, just like Paul,
is that we don't lean in.

00:28:15.705 --> 00:28:17.504
He says he's not given us spirit of fear.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.495
And I love this statement.

00:28:18.675 --> 00:28:22.084
God gives us so many things,
but we should listen up when you

00:28:22.084 --> 00:28:23.324
hear what God doesn't give you.

00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:27.090
God doesn't give you a spirit of
fear, but what does he give you?

00:28:27.179 --> 00:28:28.139
And we're gonna walk through this.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.699
He gives us power.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:30.959
What is power?

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.500
Our power comes from the Lord who
has absolute power over everything.

00:28:34.739 --> 00:28:35.340
Cool thing.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.629
God was powerful enough to
raise Jesus from the dead.

00:28:40.379 --> 00:28:42.989
He was powerful enough to save
you from your sins and give

00:28:42.989 --> 00:28:44.100
you an eternity in heaven.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:47.939
And if those two things aren't powerful
enough, I don't know what's gonna be.

00:28:48.239 --> 00:28:50.489
But if he's powerful enough
to do those two things.

00:28:52.889 --> 00:28:55.200
You think he's powerful enough
to defeat the fears in which you

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.900
have about living your faith out.

00:28:59.129 --> 00:29:00.300
I know I needed to hear this.

00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:03.360
Maybe you, you do too,
but God is powerful.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.990
So he's given us power and
he's also given us love.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.150
And we talked about love earlier,
but I wanna read this first.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.940
John four 18 says, There is no fear.

00:29:12.795 --> 00:29:18.014
In love, but perfect love cast out
fear because fear involves torment.

00:29:18.284 --> 00:29:21.435
But he who fears has not
been made perfect in love.

00:29:22.125 --> 00:29:25.605
So God, through his spirit, has
given us an unconditional love.

00:29:26.115 --> 00:29:28.635
And I want you to hear that God has
given you an unconditional love.

00:29:29.685 --> 00:29:29.955
Yeah.

00:29:30.345 --> 00:29:31.845
Um, and that unconditional love.

00:29:31.845 --> 00:29:32.534
Think about this.

00:29:32.715 --> 00:29:36.284
Despite what you do with your life,
God's love never changed about you.

00:29:36.315 --> 00:29:39.675
Did you know that God's love has
never changed about any one of.

00:29:41.024 --> 00:29:43.514
And I think about that because
again, what does fear do?

00:29:43.784 --> 00:29:45.135
What if I don't do enough for the Lord?

00:29:45.135 --> 00:29:45.975
Will he still love me?

00:29:46.575 --> 00:29:50.385
Did you know that the Lord loves
you as much today as he did

00:29:50.385 --> 00:29:51.585
at any point in your lifetime?

00:29:51.915 --> 00:29:57.794
God's loves never changed, but
our receiving that love at times

00:29:57.915 --> 00:30:02.235
changes because we think we put put
these, these limits on God's love.

00:30:02.445 --> 00:30:03.794
His love is unconditional.

00:30:04.155 --> 00:30:06.465
It's always there, but
we have to receive it.

00:30:06.825 --> 00:30:08.504
And so God has given us love.

00:30:08.939 --> 00:30:11.790
He's also given a sound
judgment or self discipline.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:16.860
Your version may say something different,
but this is a person who has life under

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.800
control, and this is what I'm not saying,
like you have it under control, but really

00:30:20.129 --> 00:30:21.840
it's under control of the spirit of God.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.010
Sound judgment allows us to take our
thoughts captive to the obedience

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:30.510
of Christ, and so remembering our
faith and the gift that God has

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:36.060
given us should cause us just like
Timothy to begin to fan into flame.

00:30:36.465 --> 00:30:38.655
The spirit of God inside
of us to live inspired.

00:30:38.835 --> 00:30:41.475
And Paul knew how important
that was for him, right?

00:30:41.475 --> 00:30:43.845
So he knew that he needed this.

00:30:44.115 --> 00:30:45.975
And so Paul tells this to Timothy, right?

00:30:46.155 --> 00:30:46.875
I love you.

00:30:47.235 --> 00:30:48.225
I pray for you.

00:30:48.645 --> 00:30:51.855
Remember your faith.

00:30:51.855 --> 00:30:53.445
Remember the gift that God has given you.

00:30:53.445 --> 00:30:55.185
Don't let fear to feed you.

00:30:55.425 --> 00:30:56.145
You've got this.

00:30:56.685 --> 00:30:59.625
But this last charge is so difficult,
and this is the one that I think

00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:00.524
all of us will struggle with.

00:31:00.735 --> 00:31:04.365
The last thing that Paul shared
was an invitation to join him

00:31:04.365 --> 00:31:05.564
in the suffering for the gospel.

00:31:06.105 --> 00:31:08.205
Does anybody just wake up and
say, I wanna suffer today.

00:31:08.565 --> 00:31:09.195
Let's suffer.

00:31:09.675 --> 00:31:10.635
Let's go suffering.

00:31:10.775 --> 00:31:11.195
Woo.

00:31:12.495 --> 00:31:15.105
I don't think any of us do, and
I don't think Timothy did either.

00:31:15.105 --> 00:31:19.125
And truth be told, I don't
think Paul enjoyed suffering.

00:31:19.755 --> 00:31:24.975
But do you know that sometimes our
suffering can bring about something good?

00:31:25.695 --> 00:31:28.905
I mean, anybody ever suffered
at your job like it's difficult.

00:31:29.925 --> 00:31:30.555
Riley's Amen.

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:31.155
And back there.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:35.429
Okay, we, at some point you have,
but you know what the good that comes

00:31:35.429 --> 00:31:38.639
out of that, you know, at the bare
minimum, you've got money in your

00:31:38.639 --> 00:31:39.990
bank account to go pay your bills.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.360
But that's good, even though it sucked.

00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:43.500
I, I use that word.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:43.919
I'm sorry.

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:46.620
Anyways, suffering can be good.

00:31:46.625 --> 00:31:49.770
So let's look at this, right, And verse
eight it says, and I'm gonna kind work

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.639
verse by verse here, but someone, he says,
So do not be ashamed of the testimony

00:31:53.639 --> 00:31:56.129
about our Lord or as me as his prisoner.

00:31:56.129 --> 00:32:00.540
Instead, sharing the suffering for
the gospel, relying on the power of.

00:32:01.544 --> 00:32:03.675
So we wanted Timothy to
share in the suffering.

00:32:03.885 --> 00:32:04.965
But here's the cool part.

00:32:05.475 --> 00:32:09.344
Paul didn't sit up, unlike a little
pedestal and said, Hey, I'm not

00:32:09.344 --> 00:32:10.784
gonna suffer, but you go suffer.

00:32:11.264 --> 00:32:14.985
Paul was in prison about to die,
and he's writing this letter to

00:32:14.985 --> 00:32:16.485
say, sharing the sufferings with me.

00:32:17.024 --> 00:32:20.745
Paul led by example to
say, Hey, it's worth it.

00:32:21.495 --> 00:32:22.304
And so I just think of it.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.715
This one, I think of
verses one through seven.

00:32:23.715 --> 00:32:25.905
This is really what Paul is
saying, therefore, Timothy.

00:32:26.715 --> 00:32:29.294
Because of my love for you and
the gifts that God has given you.

00:32:29.534 --> 00:32:33.465
Join me with power, love, and sound
mind, and don't shrink back, but press

00:32:33.465 --> 00:32:35.115
on according to the power of God.

00:32:35.294 --> 00:32:39.645
Despite what has happened to you, what
has happened to me, what will happen

00:32:39.645 --> 00:32:41.175
to you and what will happen to me.

00:32:41.715 --> 00:32:42.314
I'll tell you this.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.485
It is easier to go into battle when I see
somebody leading the charge like that.

00:32:46.875 --> 00:32:47.955
Here's the cool part.

00:32:48.495 --> 00:32:50.355
As a church, I know it
looks small right now.

00:32:50.715 --> 00:32:51.885
We're missing some people here right now.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:56.310
But you going into battle with
me and Brittany and our family,

00:32:56.669 --> 00:32:58.230
man, you know it, it's easier.

00:32:58.649 --> 00:33:02.100
It's easier to know that we link arms and
we're going into our community to change

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:06.389
our community, to show them the love of
Jesus, to help them experience what it

00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:07.409
means to have a relationship with Jesus.

00:33:07.409 --> 00:33:12.120
Like to me, that is great, and I'm
so thankful that Paul gives us this

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.520
example, is he's inviting, so I'm
inviting you to join in the suffering at.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:20.340
That it takes to plan a church and to
reach a city to not give up, to not

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:25.350
back down, to not give in to the fears
that each one of us face every day.

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.790
And I'm thankful for Paul's example
in this, and I think Timothy was too.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.550
I think of the, some of the people
that had the greatest influence in

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.130
history are those who would lead
the charge or set the example.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.360
And he wasn't challenged and
Timothy to do this on his own guys.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.770
It's from God's power, not.

00:33:41.925 --> 00:33:45.225
So as we see verses nine through 11 and
kind of just summarizing nine through

00:33:45.225 --> 00:33:51.615
11, Paul was quickly reminding Timothy
of his calling to spur him on and why

00:33:51.615 --> 00:33:53.445
he himself suffers for the gospel.

00:33:53.625 --> 00:33:55.245
Look at the words he shares here.

00:33:55.604 --> 00:33:59.084
He says, Speaking of Jesus,
he says He has saved us and

00:33:59.084 --> 00:34:00.584
called us with the holy calling.

00:34:00.854 --> 00:34:04.064
Not according to our works, but
according to his own purpose and grace,

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.685
which was given to us in Christ Jesus.

00:34:05.685 --> 00:34:08.355
Before time began, Paul could suffer.

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.980
Because of what Jesus had done for him.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:15.120
So picture this, because if Jesus
is suffering, Paul could suffer

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.650
because of Paul's suffering.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:21.450
Timothy could suffer because of Timothy's
suffering and the people after them,

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:24.240
we have received the call to suffer.

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:26.880
And I, I'm just telling you, this is hard.

00:34:26.885 --> 00:34:27.780
What does that mean?

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.870
We all suffer in different
ways to go live our faiths.

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:34.469
And like I said, that could be
time, talents, and treasures.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:38.130
Many of you that give each shit every
week, that's a form of suffering because

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.610
you're choosing to not meet some of
the financial needs that you have or

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:44.940
the things you could do to meet our
ministries needs and put on events

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:48.030
like we did last week, which I think
we spent close to probably $1,500 on.

00:34:48.034 --> 00:34:49.139
And you think that's crazy?

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:50.730
No, I think that's investment.

00:34:51.825 --> 00:34:55.095
When you say time, it took time last
week and it took time to plan that.

00:34:55.095 --> 00:34:58.245
And it takes time to go and serve and it
takes time to do all the things we do.

00:34:58.515 --> 00:35:00.495
I mean, we all, I'm just telling
you this, if I asked you,

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.605
Hey, do you got any free time?

00:35:01.605 --> 00:35:03.465
Most you'd say, Not really,
but I can make time.

00:35:03.675 --> 00:35:06.645
We make time for what we wanna make
time with that may be suffering to you.

00:35:08.025 --> 00:35:11.655
Maybe it is persecution where you go live
your faith out in your job and you get

00:35:11.655 --> 00:35:15.105
push back Where, how do your friends and
your friends think, Man, you're crazy.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.065
You're a radical Christian.

00:35:16.065 --> 00:35:17.565
You're going, No, I'm really just a c.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:23.189
I don't know what it is, but I think that
suffering that Paul is calling us to is

00:35:23.189 --> 00:35:25.980
so important because fear gets in the way.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.770
When we hear about that, we think,
Oh man, what am I gonna lose?

00:35:29.399 --> 00:35:31.620
But maybe we should start thinking
about what other people could gain

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:36.299
from overcoming our fears, not
giving into that temptation of what

00:35:36.299 --> 00:35:37.649
the enemy wants to deceive us with.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.770
So Paul said in the last verse here,
verse 12, and I'm kind of going a little

00:35:43.775 --> 00:35:45.030
bit quicker on these last couple verses.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.320
I didn't go as deep, but he says this.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.630
He says, And that is why
I suffered these things.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.050
But I am not ashamed because I know
whom I believed and have persuaded

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:55.140
that he's able to guard what has
been entrusted to me until this day.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.070
Here's what Paul knew, that no
matter what that, as he continues to

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.910
invest into Timothy and those around
him and live out his faith, that

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:04.710
God will take that no matter what.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.450
He has invested and given over to God.

00:36:06.865 --> 00:36:09.535
There's nothing that he will lose
because Jesus will be able to

00:36:09.535 --> 00:36:11.154
keep it until the end of the time.

00:36:11.634 --> 00:36:13.255
I love this statement by Martin Luther.

00:36:13.255 --> 00:36:16.645
He says this, I have held many
things in my hands and I've lost

00:36:16.645 --> 00:36:21.325
them all, but whatever I placed in
God's hands that I still possess.

00:36:23.424 --> 00:36:25.585
What are you placing in God's hands?

00:36:26.305 --> 00:36:27.505
You know what I wrote down over here?

00:36:28.075 --> 00:36:35.214
This church, his people, and this
city, It's God's church, Y'all.

00:36:35.685 --> 00:36:36.645
Are God's people.

00:36:36.825 --> 00:36:38.444
This city is God's.

00:36:38.805 --> 00:36:43.395
And if I continue, if you continue to
think that about your neighbors, your

00:36:43.395 --> 00:36:47.595
friends, your coworkers, your city, your
small group, whatever it is, and you

00:36:47.595 --> 00:36:52.064
place them in God's hands, here's what I
believe, based upon the word of God, that

00:36:52.064 --> 00:36:54.375
it will be there, that God will take it.

00:36:54.375 --> 00:36:55.995
He will bless that.

00:36:55.995 --> 00:36:57.944
He will continue to keep it.

00:36:58.665 --> 00:37:01.995
But anything you keep in your
hands, your control that you

00:37:01.995 --> 00:37:03.555
may lose and you most likely.

00:37:04.635 --> 00:37:07.605
And again, I, I read these, these
verses speaking to myself as

00:37:07.605 --> 00:37:08.715
much as I'm speaking to anybody.

00:37:09.615 --> 00:37:13.605
So p Paul's last words of encouragement
is basically saying to Timothy, I've

00:37:13.845 --> 00:37:15.915
been inspired by Jesus to live inspired.

00:37:15.915 --> 00:37:16.575
I love that.

00:37:17.295 --> 00:37:21.735
Now, Timothy, what have you to do now, and
this is where we're gonna see in the next

00:37:21.735 --> 00:37:25.505
couple weeks, but I gotta already say this
verse, we're gonna see in Timothy Tutu.

00:37:26.025 --> 00:37:27.675
Where he really challenges Timothy this.

00:37:27.675 --> 00:37:31.125
He says, Take everything that you've
heard from me and the presence of many

00:37:31.125 --> 00:37:34.395
witnesses and commit these to faithful
men who will be able to teach others.

00:37:34.395 --> 00:37:41.175
Also, ultimately, Paul's challenge,
his last words was to take everything

00:37:41.175 --> 00:37:46.125
that I've taught you and wisely invest
it in other people who will take

00:37:46.275 --> 00:37:48.105
it and invest it into other people.

00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:51.345
And that's how we got the gospel
and why we can plan a church and

00:37:51.345 --> 00:37:52.815
why we have what we have today.

00:37:52.995 --> 00:37:53.625
I think that's really.

00:37:54.615 --> 00:37:57.015
So as we think through this
guys and as we go into a time of

00:37:57.015 --> 00:37:58.815
invitation, how can we reflect?

00:37:58.995 --> 00:38:00.315
What can we take with this?

00:38:00.915 --> 00:38:01.815
Well, we take a lot of things.

00:38:01.815 --> 00:38:04.005
If you're anything like me, you're
probably like, Now, which part

00:38:04.005 --> 00:38:04.755
do you want me to take home?

00:38:04.755 --> 00:38:05.985
Cuz there's a lot of parts to it.

00:38:06.795 --> 00:38:11.145
I wanna kind of challenge you in a
couple places and, and it's this,

00:38:12.045 --> 00:38:13.935
maybe today you needed to hear that.

00:38:13.935 --> 00:38:19.725
Not that Paul loves Timothy, but
that Jesus loves you, that he calls

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.755
you a dearly love son or daughter.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.370
Maybe you needed to hear that
today, and, and if you did, man,

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:27.690
let that minister to you right now.

00:38:28.259 --> 00:38:32.370
Let that minister to you and, and thank
God for it, because God does love you

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:34.440
as a dearly loved son or daughter.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.970
Maybe today.

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:39.630
You needed to hear the challenge,
to remember your faith, where it

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:41.970
came from, what God has given you.

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:44.820
How God has called you to use the gift.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.250
And if you're wondering what that gift
is, that you can seek the Lord and say,

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:51.540
Lord, fan, the, the gift of whatever
you've given me into my life so that I

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.990
can impact those around me, maybe you
need to ask God to do that in your life.

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:58.710
So remind you of your faith and to fan
inflam the gift that God has given you.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:03.540
Maybe God's inviting you to join the
suffering and you may not know what that

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.460
means, so you can just pray the Lord.

00:39:05.745 --> 00:39:08.835
Reveals that to you, how you can
suffer in a godly way, right?

00:39:08.835 --> 00:39:11.595
Not in a way to justify your
faith, but in a way that brings

00:39:11.595 --> 00:39:12.825
people to faith in Christ.

00:39:14.025 --> 00:39:16.545
I know that's one of the most
difficult ones to understand, but

00:39:16.605 --> 00:39:18.884
I think it's one that we all should
pray through and ask God what he's

00:39:18.884 --> 00:39:21.375
calling us to do in that area, right?

00:39:22.245 --> 00:39:24.855
Our response is that we
are who we are, right?

00:39:24.884 --> 00:39:29.985
As a church because, and we do what we
do because of what God has done for us.

00:39:30.375 --> 00:39:32.055
And guys, here's, here's a challenge.

00:39:32.565 --> 00:39:34.154
We don't come to just be better people.

00:39:34.529 --> 00:39:38.549
We come to make a difference in the lives
of those around us because as we become

00:39:38.549 --> 00:39:42.480
better people, as we become closer to
Christ, we will show Christ to others.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.710
And this statement may, I hope it
sticks with you, but it's the last

00:39:46.714 --> 00:39:47.640
statement I wanna share with you.

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:52.080
Charles Spurgeon said this about
people who don't know Jesus around us.

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:52.980
Here's what he said.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.460
And again, this is old
English, so hang with me.

00:39:57.149 --> 00:40:02.069
He said, If sinners be damned,
at least let them leap to

00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:03.660
hell over our dead bodies.

00:40:04.575 --> 00:40:06.944
And if they perish, let 'em perish.

00:40:06.944 --> 00:40:11.865
Where their arms wrapped around their
knees, imploring them to stay, and if

00:40:11.865 --> 00:40:17.205
hell must be filled, let it be filled
with the teeth of our exertions and let

00:40:17.205 --> 00:40:20.475
no one go unwarranted, un prayed for here.

00:40:20.475 --> 00:40:22.154
Here's really his heartness.

00:40:22.904 --> 00:40:26.805
Is he saying, man, like guys,
if people are going to spend

00:40:26.805 --> 00:40:30.194
an eternity as separated from
God, don't let it be because you

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:31.815
didn't try to prevent them from.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:38.580
that challenges me because at times
I, I feel like that I'm afraid

00:40:38.819 --> 00:40:39.960
to stop them from going to hell.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:41.549
Now that, listen to
what I just said there.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:44.910
I'm afraid to stop them from going to
hell because I might hurt their feelings.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.759
That sounds bad, doesn't it?

00:40:48.509 --> 00:40:51.839
But I think we should be more
concerned because these people are

00:40:51.839 --> 00:40:55.529
going into attorney separated from
God, and if God's changed you,

00:40:55.529 --> 00:40:56.940
you don't want them to go there.

00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:01.920
So when we implore, when we, when we grab
at their feet, we're doing it out of love.

00:41:02.415 --> 00:41:06.915
Not outta judgment because at the end,
all of us is gonna be judged and the only

00:41:06.915 --> 00:41:10.875
reason why we won't be judged by our sense
is because of what Jesus did on the cross.

00:41:11.835 --> 00:41:13.005
So maybe that's you today.

00:41:13.005 --> 00:41:16.214
Maybe you hear that statement and you're
the one that hasn't given your life

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.214
to Christ and you're heading to hell
if you don't give your life to Christ.

00:41:19.214 --> 00:41:23.174
And that's a tough statement to
hear, but maybe you need to hear it

00:41:23.174 --> 00:41:27.464
today that, that today the gospel's
been shared, that Jesus came to this

00:41:27.464 --> 00:41:29.205
earth to save sinners just like you.

00:41:30.645 --> 00:41:34.365
And he didn't do it because you know,
we might need it, but we did need it.

00:41:34.455 --> 00:41:36.525
We needed to be forgiven of
our sins because we couldn't

00:41:36.795 --> 00:41:37.755
pay for our sins on our own.

00:41:37.755 --> 00:41:40.875
And if we could, we really, that's
where eternity with hell and hell

00:41:41.055 --> 00:41:42.435
is, and that's where our sins get us.

00:41:42.435 --> 00:41:44.685
And so if you haven't given your life
to Christ, you can do that today.

00:41:44.985 --> 00:41:45.674
Every one of you.

00:41:45.944 --> 00:41:47.415
Me, I can give my life to Christ.

00:41:47.415 --> 00:41:48.555
If I haven't given my life to Christ.

00:41:49.035 --> 00:41:49.725
Maybe that's you.

00:41:50.384 --> 00:41:53.340
So my challenge during, in this
time of invitation is if that, Come

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.020
talk to me and I know it's awkward.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:58.529
We have like six people in here and I'm
gonna be in the back, come find me after

00:41:58.529 --> 00:42:00.120
service, we'll make it less awkward.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.120
Come talk to me, ask questions, what
it means to give your life to Christ.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.810
But I challenge you during this time
of invitation to just really seek the

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:11.790
Lord on how he would remind you of his
love, his gift, and faith in your life.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.480
And his challenges suffer alongside
him for the sake of the gospel.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:16.170
So let's pray.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.400
Lord Jesus, we love you.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:17.880
Lord.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.310
We thank you for this
time today in service.

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:21.900
We thank you for your love.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.850
We thank you for your call.

00:42:24.569 --> 00:42:27.720
God, I pray that if there was anything
spoken today, Lord, that was not

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.630
valuable for us, Lord, may you remove
it from our minds and our hearts, Lord.

00:42:30.634 --> 00:42:33.779
But I pray that everything
that was spoken is encouraging.

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:38.970
Teach one of us, Lord God, I
don't know where everybody stands.

00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:41.685
And their faith to you.

00:42:42.795 --> 00:42:43.605
But Lord, you do.

00:42:44.205 --> 00:42:47.895
And everybody in this room that is
seeking you right now, Lord does as well.

00:42:48.134 --> 00:42:51.734
I just pray for you to move, to challenge
them, to take a next step in their faith.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:55.095
Lord, is it to give their lives
to you Lord, or to take a next

00:42:55.095 --> 00:42:58.634
step, Lord to baptism or to, to a
next step and involved in serving?

00:42:58.634 --> 00:43:02.234
Or is it a taking next step and
into to just suffering for you?

00:43:02.234 --> 00:43:03.825
Lord, I don't know what it is, but you.

00:43:04.695 --> 00:43:06.645
And because you do, Lord, I pray
that you move in their hearts.

00:43:06.645 --> 00:43:09.705
Lord, you move in my heart and the
area I need to take a next step in.

00:43:11.325 --> 00:43:17.295
Lord, let this message change each one of
us Lord, to be a light to those around us.

00:43:18.135 --> 00:43:19.635
And so, Lord, we just pray
this in your heavily name.

00:43:20.295 --> 00:43:20.595
Amen.

00:43:39.535 --> 00:43:50.955
You go, Before I know that
you've even gone to win my war,

00:43:52.634 --> 00:43:58.654
you come back head my enemy.

00:44:00.015 --> 00:44:05.774
You come back and you my victory.

00:44:07.634 --> 00:44:07.984
Oh,

00:44:19.375 --> 00:44:27.555
I know that you've even
gone to win my war.

00:44:28.965 --> 00:44:35.145
Your love becomes my defense.

00:44:36.435 --> 00:44:38.505
It leads me from the drawing

00:44:43.695 --> 00:44:46.405
and all I did was praying.

00:44:51.375 --> 00:44:54.645
All I did was was share.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.500
All I did was

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:06.740
all

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.470
you have saved me.

00:45:22.875 --> 00:45:26.075
So much better away.

00:45:37.095 --> 00:45:38.395
So much better.

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:57.480
You know, before I do where my heart can
see to find your truth, your mercy is the

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:08.320
time you restore my faith and hold again.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.860
And all I did was pray,

00:46:17.069 --> 00:46:19.710
and all I did was worship.

00:46:24.049 --> 00:46:25.630
All I did was

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:34.710
all I did was stay, stay.

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.750
Great.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.340
So much better.

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:03.120
I.

00:47:05.595 --> 00:47:08.805
When I thought I lost me.

00:47:09.134 --> 00:47:18.205
