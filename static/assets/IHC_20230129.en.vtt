00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
That's the context now in which we read.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.390
He looks back on God's goodness
to him, and he looks forward

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.220
to the dangers and the hope.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.230
The Lord stood by me, gave me strength
to proclaim the message fully.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.000
All right.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.400
For those of you who maybe haven't
been here since November, November

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.280
was the last time that we had been
in the book of second Timothy.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.330
Uh, typically as a church, we, we
spent some time throughout the year

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.650
walking through books of the Bible.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.190
Um, and this last year we were
choosing to do Second Timothy.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.380
Um, and we got to Christmas
season and we wanted to be

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.460
able to do a Christmas series.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.890
And then we kind of had some other
things, um, for this month that

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.920
we wanted to focus on before we
jump back into the Timothy series.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.769
And so we'll be finishing,
um, uh, prayerfully.

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.690
We'll be finishing second
Timothy by the end of.

00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:56.584
Um, but we're jumping back in, so don't
worry if you haven't been here, I'll try

00:00:56.584 --> 00:00:58.235
to do the best I can to catch you up.

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:02.434
Uh, but we'll be in second Timothy
chapter three, uh, starting in

00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:05.345
verse one and going through nine.

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:09.935
And, uh, we're gonna be talking
about this topic of avoiding those

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:11.435
who negatively influence you.

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:15.485
Um, and there's gonna be some
interesting things as we talk about this.

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:16.445
So let me, let me ask this question.

00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:17.585
Let, let's, let's flip it here.

00:01:17.975 --> 00:01:20.645
Who has been influenced
positively by somebody?

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.130
To really like help you become
the person you are today.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.449
So who has been influenced positively
by someone to become who you are today?

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:30.929
Okay, so most of us would
say, yeah, that's me, right?

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.229
Like most of us have somebody,
like whenever I think back,

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.250
I think about teachers.

00:01:36.345 --> 00:01:37.305
. I think about mentors.

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:41.265
I think about pastors, I think about
family members, uh, that have been a

00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:43.155
part of helping me become who I am.

00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:44.055
So that's an easy one.

00:01:44.055 --> 00:01:48.405
Like a lot of us think of that, but
most of us may remember seasons in

00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:52.195
our lives, and maybe you have one
currently, um, of there's been negative

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.265
influence in your life that has
negatively influenced you in a bad way.

00:01:56.805 --> 00:01:58.815
Um, I wanna share this
quote with you by Jim Rom.

00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:02.895
He says this, you're the average of the
five people you spend time with the.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.950
And he goes on to say this.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.770
He says, show me your friends
and I'll show you your future

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.110
when we look in this text today.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.090
And so, you know, I'm not just
quoting all these other people

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.020
as though that's like biblical.

00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:16.260
But what I'm saying is really this
guy's backing up what the Bible says.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.920
As we look into today's text, we're
gonna see how Paul affirms that same

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.490
thing where he is gonna warn us as
he warned Timothy, to avoid people in

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.380
our lives who negatively influence us.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.590
Um, and so lemme kind of catch
you up on where we've been so

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.730
that everybody can be on the same.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.660
we covered two chapters
previously last year.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.590
Um, and really second Timothy
is Paul's second letter.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.640
That sounds logical, right?

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.060
Cause there was the first Timothy
Paul's second letter to Timothy, and

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.140
many believe this is his last letter
that he writes from prison before he.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.950
Dies.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.299
Uh, so this is a critical letter, and
as we think about this, Timothy was

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.880
kinda like Paul's, um, right hand man.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.859
He was training him up and eventually
to probably replace him as a leader, uh,

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.690
in the, the, the church community here.

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.230
And so for Timothy, uh, this
would be a critical letter.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.959
And so I don't know if you've ever
been, and again I'm not trying to get

00:03:06.964 --> 00:03:09.269
emotional here with this, but if you've
ever been on the deathbed of someone,

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.269
typically their last words are some
of the most important words to you.

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:12.570
You're.

00:03:13.995 --> 00:03:16.545
, you, you wanna hear those last words
and I think of that same thing.

00:03:16.545 --> 00:03:20.175
And I really wanna encourage you as
we study through the rest of second

00:03:20.175 --> 00:03:24.735
Timothy, for you to lean in in such
a way as though Paul the Apostle

00:03:24.735 --> 00:03:26.265
is speaking to you on his deathbed.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.635
These are critical words and if we
miss that, sometimes we'll just look at

00:03:31.635 --> 00:03:33.015
them as just, uh, they're just words.

00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:33.885
Cuz you guys know this.

00:03:33.885 --> 00:03:35.265
We say a lot of words in a day.

00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:38.355
But these words I think are critical
because they're at the end of his life.

00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:40.815
So here's what Timothy was Challeng.

00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:43.185
By Paul in the first two chapters.

00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:45.405
The first thing that Paul
challenged Timothy was to

00:03:45.405 --> 00:03:46.995
remember his faith and gift.

00:03:47.325 --> 00:03:49.815
What we know about
Timothy, Timothy was timid.

00:03:50.265 --> 00:03:55.065
Timothy was dealing with false teachers
who were giving pushback in his church.

00:03:55.305 --> 00:03:57.945
He was the, uh, pastor of
Ephesus, is what most believed.

00:03:58.365 --> 00:03:59.775
Um, and so he's getting this pushback.

00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:03.495
And so Timothy, because of this pushback,
needed to be encouraged to remember.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.610
Paul had laid hands on him and encouraged
him in his faith that his mother and his

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.360
grandmother had raised him up to know
Jesus and that he needed to remember his

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.400
faith and gift and to not get discouraged.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.490
So that would encourage us as well
to remember our faith and gift.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.930
We learned that Paul also invited
Timothy to join him in the suffering.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.920
I remember that part of it.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.010
That wasn't a fun one cuz we're
like, who wants to suffer?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.530
But what we do realize is that when we
suffer for something good, it's worth.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.120
I've never been pregnant, but
ladies, when you have a baby, there's

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.310
a lot of pain and you know it.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.380
Um, but it's worth it from what I hear.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.050
It's worth it on the other side.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.340
So that suffering sometimes is difficult,
but it's worth it on the other side.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.550
So we see this, that as Paul joined
him in the suffering, Paul says

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.659
to Timothy, gentleman suffering.

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.240
He's saying it's worth it because
there's people that will come to faith

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.530
in Christ and it's worth it for us.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.130
Then he challenged Timothy and
us to train up others to take

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.599
the message of the gospel.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.090
To the ends of the earth, basically.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.600
Right?

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.410
He knew this, that Timothy could
only go so far by himself, but

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.240
together we can go further.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.730
So he says, take men who will teach
other men about the truth of the gospel.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.280
And, and so, you know, and
that day men were the leaders,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.450
but ult ultimately he's seen.

00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:22.094
People, all y'all, all of
us, let's take the message.

00:05:22.094 --> 00:05:23.385
So let's train one another up.

00:05:23.474 --> 00:05:24.734
So we should train one up, right?

00:05:24.734 --> 00:05:25.664
We're better together.

00:05:26.114 --> 00:05:29.565
Then he challenged Timothy to
confront the false teachers and to

00:05:29.565 --> 00:05:33.914
avoid anything that would distract
him or his church from the mission.

00:05:34.575 --> 00:05:35.775
I, I remember this quote, Craig.

00:05:35.775 --> 00:05:38.114
Rochelle says this, the devil
doesn't need to destroy you,

00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:39.405
he just needs to distract you.

00:05:40.094 --> 00:05:42.195
The devil doesn't need to destroy
you, he just needs to distract you.

00:05:42.195 --> 00:05:44.085
I'll just tell you this today.

00:05:44.085 --> 00:05:45.364
We are a distracted.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.410
and that is not absent in the church.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.460
We are a church.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.350
We are a church body as a, as a
whole that get easily distracted

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.740
from the mission because the enemy
is constantly working to distract us.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.340
And then the last thing that we covered
before, we'll jump into verse three.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.200
We covered this at the end of November.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.219
Uh, he said this, do not miss
the opportunity to be used by

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:10.080
God as special instruments.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.830
So he begins to describe these instruments
for good and these instruments for bad.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.539
And ultimately, Paul was challenging
Timothy and us to understand that

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:24.539
God has given us the gift of the Holy
Spirit, the gift of salvation, to be

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.080
able to fulfill our purpose, to help
other people discover hope in Jesus.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.030
That was our last challenge.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.180
And so the cool part with that, like
that last challenge was like a, a man.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.420
This is.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.289
. But the next thing that we're gonna
see here is where Paul starts off

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.080
this chapter by saying, but know this.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.789
Here's what he's basically saying.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.159
Beware of what is coming.

00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:45.599
So let's jump in the text.

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:47.400
Let's read together again.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.979
Second Timothy chapter
three, starting in verse one.

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:50.640
Here's what it says.

00:06:50.645 --> 00:06:56.669
It says, but know this hard times
will come in the last days for

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:00.750
people will be lovers of self and
lovers of money, and boastful and

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.820
proud and demeaning and disobedient.

00:07:03.585 --> 00:07:04.455
To parents.

00:07:04.545 --> 00:07:06.165
Ungrateful and unholy.

00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:08.505
Unloving and irre.

00:07:09.085 --> 00:07:09.565
Reconcilable.

00:07:10.035 --> 00:07:16.545
Slanderers without self-control, brutal
without love, for what is good, traitors,

00:07:16.695 --> 00:07:22.095
reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure
rather than lovers of God holding to the

00:07:22.095 --> 00:07:24.885
form of godliness, but denying its power.

00:07:25.335 --> 00:07:27.285
He says, avoid these people.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.400
For, among them are those who worm their
way into households and deceive gullible

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.380
women who over are overwhelmed by sins
and led astray by very a variety of

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.700
passions, always learning and never able
to come to the knowledge of the truth

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.180
just as Janus and jam resisted Moses.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.950
So these also resist the truth.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.350
They are men who are corrupt in mine.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.150
Worthless in regard to the faith.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.270
, but they will not make further
progress for their foolishness.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.110
We'll be clear to all, as was the
foolishness of Janus and chambers.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.590
Let's pray.

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.900
Lord Jesus, we thank
you Lord for your word.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.890
We know it's truth and we are praying it
over our lives, Lord, that we take from

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:09.810
it today and we learn and then we apply
to our lives to go out and live in such

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.770
a way that honors you and helps us live
the lives that you called us to live.

00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:15.210
We pray this in Jesus name.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:16.530
Amen.

00:08:17.099 --> 00:08:21.525
So, um, What is so challenging in
this statement is the first thing

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.135
he says, his hard times will come.

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:27.615
Does anybody wake up and hear
that statement and go, yay.

00:08:28.635 --> 00:08:31.695
I mean, you know this like Mondays,
sometimes Mondays are hard days cuz you

00:08:31.695 --> 00:08:33.270
know you have a lot of work going on.

00:08:34.605 --> 00:08:35.715
and you are like, yay.

00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:36.885
Like, this is awesome.

00:08:36.914 --> 00:08:40.455
No, usually you're dreading him
so many times we have to kind

00:08:40.455 --> 00:08:41.655
of prepare our hearts for this.

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:46.335
And so he's trying to prepare Timothy
in the church for these last days.

00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:49.725
Um, and so he says this, know
this hard times will come.

00:08:50.115 --> 00:08:53.865
And I want you to know this for
yourself, for you personally.

00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:57.735
And the same thing for Timothy when
God is doing something good in your

00:08:57.735 --> 00:09:02.115
life or is about to do something
good in your life, know this.

00:09:03.975 --> 00:09:05.295
Tough times are ahead.

00:09:06.435 --> 00:09:06.945
Why?

00:09:07.605 --> 00:09:10.965
Because there is an enemy that is
trying to still kill and destroy

00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:14.235
what God is doing in your life,
what God is doing around you.

00:09:14.775 --> 00:09:19.095
And so because of that, if we're going
to experience anything good, right?

00:09:19.365 --> 00:09:20.655
It's going to be hard.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.315
Think about this.

00:09:21.345 --> 00:09:25.215
If you just think about your marriage,
if you have a marriage, marriage is hard.

00:09:25.995 --> 00:09:26.775
I love my wife.

00:09:26.805 --> 00:09:28.515
It's not hard every day, but it's hard.

00:09:28.905 --> 00:09:32.790
But because I know that I'm
prepared, Here's the other thing.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.590
A good meal is hard to cook.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.620
Moms, dads who cook, yeah, you get it.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.770
It's hard, but it's good on the other
side, so it's worth the hard effort.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.900
I would say this, it's
hard to plan a church.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.520
Been in the midst of it.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.770
It's hard to plan a church, but it
is worth it because we understand

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.040
that the enemy's trying to deceive
us in the midst of this hard.

00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:56.295
And God wants to do something great.

00:09:56.355 --> 00:09:59.265
And this is what reminds me of James
chapter one, verse two and three,

00:09:59.595 --> 00:10:01.035
where he says, consider it great joy.

00:10:01.035 --> 00:10:04.815
My brothers and sisters, whenever
you experience various trials,

00:10:05.055 --> 00:10:09.495
because you know the testing of
your faith produces endurance.

00:10:09.615 --> 00:10:11.875
These various trials is basically
saying, you know, you're gonna

00:10:12.075 --> 00:10:18.435
experience hard trials, not if,
but when you experience hard times.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.620
And we need to remember that, that God
is going to try to continue to work

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.620
through you, even in these difficult
times, to grow you and change you.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.430
And, and, and when we think about
this, this, this contrast between

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.570
Paul's last message of like, man, you
are instruments used for God's glory.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.790
Go out and live in such a way.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.870
And then he says, but, but
be prepared for hard times.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.200
Sometimes that is difficult
because don't we want life to be.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.760
Anybody, maybe you like life, heart easy.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.050
I mean, you like heart, life hard.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.780
If you do praise God for you.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.470
Okay.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.540
Um, I, I, I'm not that person, but
he mentions this word in the last

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.860
days, and this is a critical time.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.450
What does it mean by in the last days?

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:08.970
Well, what Paul is really speaking to
is in the last days started when Jesus

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:14.250
came to this earth, lived a sinless life,
died on the cross for our sins and rose.

00:11:15.015 --> 00:11:20.085
To spend eternity in heaven with his
father in our place so that we could

00:11:20.085 --> 00:11:21.465
one day have a relationship with him.

00:11:21.465 --> 00:11:24.885
Those end times have started
now, and so Paul knew Timothy was

00:11:25.035 --> 00:11:27.075
in the midst of the end times.

00:11:27.285 --> 00:11:31.245
We are in the midst of the end
times, still 2000 years later.

00:11:32.819 --> 00:11:36.959
. So if you thought that, you know,
it was gonna be easy as a Christian,

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.230
maybe you came to the wrong church
to, to, to, to miss that idea.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.780
But when we studied the Bible, the
Bible tells us it will be hard,

00:11:43.439 --> 00:11:46.530
but God is going to continue to
do great things in our lives, even

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:47.910
though those hard things are there.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.640
So I, I wanna just challenge
you with this statement.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.020
This is why Paul says this.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:56.010
Know that there's gonna be hard times,
it is easier to prepare for the hard

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.620
times than to respond to the hard times.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.400
Does anybody understand what that.

00:12:00.285 --> 00:12:03.525
It's easier to prepare for the
hard times than to respond.

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:05.355
Great example.

00:12:05.385 --> 00:12:07.215
You ever been out and your tire go flat?

00:12:07.245 --> 00:12:08.115
You don't have a spare?

00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:10.995
Done it before.

00:12:11.235 --> 00:12:11.535
Okay.

00:12:12.135 --> 00:12:13.185
That's difficult.

00:12:13.485 --> 00:12:16.545
But when we make sure we have the spare
and it's actually aired up when we make

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:20.895
sure we have, you know, the, the towing
service on your insurance, we're prepared.

00:12:20.895 --> 00:12:23.925
It's a lot easier to
deal with the hard times.

00:12:24.885 --> 00:12:26.490
See, Paul is telling Timothy, let's.

00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:31.365
Paul is telling us as a
church, let's prepare.

00:12:31.814 --> 00:12:32.564
Let's prepare.

00:12:32.564 --> 00:12:35.714
Let's be aware of the hard times, right?

00:12:35.925 --> 00:12:39.975
And so as James one says this, God
desires for us to come out stronger

00:12:39.975 --> 00:12:42.405
on the other side of these hard
times, not just make it through.

00:12:42.405 --> 00:12:44.714
I wanna be as critical as I can
with this, cuz I think it's so

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.454
important for you and for me.

00:12:46.694 --> 00:12:49.755
When we go through these hard times,
don't just hold your breath through them.

00:12:50.745 --> 00:12:52.125
God wants you to grow.

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:56.145
So on the other side of these
hard times, you are strong.

00:12:57.285 --> 00:12:58.005
You are stronger.

00:12:58.035 --> 00:13:02.265
I'll, I'll just tell you this, I
am crazy, but I love to work out.

00:13:02.985 --> 00:13:06.165
But do you know whenever I work
out hard and Wesa know this, I

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:11.565
was dead yesterday and on Friday
when I was working out just dead.

00:13:12.315 --> 00:13:14.295
But you wanna know, I do that when
I enjoy it, but I don't wanna get

00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:17.745
stronger because if I was gonna
get weaker, why would I do that?

00:13:18.615 --> 00:13:19.515
I mean, it'd be stupid.

00:13:19.545 --> 00:13:21.315
Now you guys still may think
I'm stupid, but I love that.

00:13:21.345 --> 00:13:21.615
Right?

00:13:21.825 --> 00:13:24.135
But I know I'm gonna get
stronger, so I enjoy it.

00:13:24.675 --> 00:13:28.635
So for me, When we think about
trials, when we think about

00:13:28.635 --> 00:13:30.495
hard times, it's so important.

00:13:30.495 --> 00:13:32.955
We want to come out stronger
as we go through them, right?

00:13:33.075 --> 00:13:34.875
So what will be so hard?

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.335
That's what Paul, we're gonna answer
a lot of questions in this text.

00:13:37.485 --> 00:13:38.715
What will be so hard?

00:13:39.135 --> 00:13:40.605
Here's basically the statement.

00:13:40.875 --> 00:13:42.915
What's gonna be so hard is
we have to deal with people.

00:13:44.475 --> 00:13:44.865
Yay.

00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:48.255
You know, I heard this statement
once, ministry would be easy if we

00:13:48.255 --> 00:13:51.135
didn't have to deal with people,
but then we wouldn't have people.

00:13:51.135 --> 00:13:54.735
So anyways, um, it, it's
this idea, I think at times.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:14:00.690
Um, we want people to be like us because
we think it would be easier, but if

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:03.570
it they were like us, then we would
probably still be annoyed with us too.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.220
And that, that's the tough part.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.550
So we have to do life with people and
so that's what he begins to describe

00:14:08.555 --> 00:14:10.620
here is these different people.

00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:10.800
Right?

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.950
He gives 18 different characteristics
of different people here.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.890
But I wanna make sure we don't get
ahead of ourselves because this is,

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.840
when I read this text, let me just tell
you what a typical church member does.

00:14:23.175 --> 00:14:25.905
They read this text and they
go, man, I can't believe there's

00:14:25.905 --> 00:14:26.805
people out there like that.

00:14:28.065 --> 00:14:29.415
Those people are so horrible.

00:14:29.805 --> 00:14:32.175
How dare they, man, I'm
gonna stay away from them.

00:14:32.475 --> 00:14:37.125
They're horrible people and I begin
to separate myself as though they're

00:14:37.125 --> 00:14:39.225
just so bad and, and we're so good.

00:14:41.355 --> 00:14:48.525
Can, can I just challenge you today
to take down your pride me include.

00:14:49.454 --> 00:14:51.074
Let's read this and
here's, here's my prayer.

00:14:51.405 --> 00:14:55.814
As the Lord reveals that this
may be you, may he convict you to

00:14:55.814 --> 00:14:58.094
repentance and draw you to repentance.

00:14:58.995 --> 00:15:00.584
Repentance is is a beautiful thing.

00:15:01.185 --> 00:15:04.064
It's not punishment,
it's actually freedom.

00:15:04.425 --> 00:15:05.204
I'm gonna say that again.

00:15:05.714 --> 00:15:07.305
Repentance is a beautiful thing.

00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:10.395
It's not punishment, it's
freedom from our sins.

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:14.084
So as you read this today, as you
study this today with me, if you

00:15:14.084 --> 00:15:16.875
see something in your life, I pray
that you repent and turn from it.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.969
, I pray that I repent and turn
from it today because we will

00:15:20.969 --> 00:15:21.959
be better on the other side.

00:15:21.959 --> 00:15:22.949
So let's look at this again.

00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:24.930
I wanna make sure we don't just,
because here, here's the thing.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:29.550
We know when we start pointing fingers,
I started looking at this last night.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.660
There's three pointing back at us.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.260
I thought four.

00:15:31.265 --> 00:15:32.520
But this one's pointing forward too.

00:15:32.819 --> 00:15:35.610
But when we start pointing fingers,
there's three pointing back at us.

00:15:35.939 --> 00:15:39.030
So we had to remember to a look at
ourselves first before we go to others.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.480
So let's look at this big list and we're
gonna walk through it pretty quickly.

00:15:41.985 --> 00:15:45.735
So he mentions here for
people will be lovers of self.

00:15:45.735 --> 00:15:46.515
What does that mean?

00:15:46.515 --> 00:15:48.944
Selfish only thinking of themselves.

00:15:48.944 --> 00:15:53.625
And so, you know, everything will
be based upon this one statement.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.214
Lovers of self, right?

00:15:55.635 --> 00:15:59.355
Next, lovers of money, which means
they'll covet and worship it as

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.574
though it controls their happiness.

00:16:01.935 --> 00:16:03.795
Number three, boastful.

00:16:04.155 --> 00:16:07.395
Which means that they'll be
flaunting what they have and they'll

00:16:07.395 --> 00:16:09.165
be boasting about their achieve.

00:16:10.155 --> 00:16:11.505
Number four, proud.

00:16:11.895 --> 00:16:14.025
They'll be showing one self above others.

00:16:14.775 --> 00:16:16.035
I love this and I say I love this.

00:16:16.035 --> 00:16:18.105
In this definition, not
I love this idea, right?

00:16:18.345 --> 00:16:23.595
Um, with an overwhelming estimate of
one's means or merits, despising others.

00:16:24.405 --> 00:16:29.085
So sometimes we're proud, but in
being proud, we really despise

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:33.465
others in the midst of it, and we
don't even realize that demeaning,

00:16:33.615 --> 00:16:35.445
which means to speak evil things.

00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:37.695
One who was slanderous or abusive.

00:16:38.459 --> 00:16:39.990
Disobedience to parents.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.729
Every parent probably says Amen.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.699
Okay, disobedience to parents,
this can speak to adults.

00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:47.520
We've done this before in another
text that we've covered, but, uh,

00:16:47.579 --> 00:16:52.020
basically ignoring parents' direction,
not respecting their authority

00:16:52.025 --> 00:16:53.370
or their position in their lives.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:59.339
Ungrateful, never satisfied
with what they have, and never

00:16:59.859 --> 00:17:02.579
thankful for God or others.

00:17:03.345 --> 00:17:04.335
We're only on number eight.

00:17:04.335 --> 00:17:05.595
There's 18 characteristics here.

00:17:05.595 --> 00:17:06.045
It's crazy.

00:17:06.045 --> 00:17:08.085
He wanted, he wanted to make
sure we didn't miss anything.

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:10.694
Uh, number eight, unholy.

00:17:11.055 --> 00:17:12.225
So I had kinda look at this.

00:17:12.735 --> 00:17:16.185
I knew what holy was, holy
is to be set apart, to become

00:17:16.245 --> 00:17:17.325
more and more like Christ.

00:17:17.325 --> 00:17:22.545
So what it is, unholy, unholy, is to
be set apart, to wickedness, to become

00:17:22.545 --> 00:17:25.815
more and more like the devil, the enemy.

00:17:26.444 --> 00:17:27.765
That, that, that's.

00:17:28.709 --> 00:17:30.959
Unloving, and there's
another word for this.

00:17:30.959 --> 00:17:34.740
As we begin to study other
translations, unloving or without

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:39.090
natural affection, it's one
obviously who doesn't love someone?

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.740
And here was another definition.

00:17:40.949 --> 00:17:47.100
This person will be called inhuman to not
love, to not have a natural affection.

00:17:48.179 --> 00:17:51.330
Ear reconcile, reconcilable,
unwilling to reconcile with.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.890
Or with situations, which again goes
about back to the selfish mentality.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.130
Slanders, people who would
accuse someone falsely.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:05.220
Some translations would even change
this word, slanders into devil or

00:18:05.225 --> 00:18:10.350
devilish, um, without self-control,
which means this, do what I feel like

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.440
whatever I want, doesn't matter who it
affects, doesn't matter what God thinks.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.010
I'll just do whatever I think
brutal, which means violent or

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.600
uncontrolled in their actions.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:19.470
I'm getting closer guys.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.580
I promise I'm getting closer.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.060
Let's just keep.

00:18:22.139 --> 00:18:24.179
without love for what is good.

00:18:24.179 --> 00:18:24.780
Here's the thing.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.610
They don't only oppose what's good.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.560
They oppose what's good for you.

00:18:28.979 --> 00:18:33.149
They don't even like when you have
good traitors people who are willing to

00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:39.149
betray those closest to them, reckless
acting without thinking or caring about

00:18:39.155 --> 00:18:40.320
the consequences of their actions.

00:18:41.264 --> 00:18:43.665
Conceded to think of oneself.

00:18:43.725 --> 00:18:45.345
Too highly prideful.

00:18:45.554 --> 00:18:46.725
Looking down on others.

00:18:46.815 --> 00:18:51.705
And the last one, lovers of pleasure
rather than lovers of God, choosing

00:18:51.705 --> 00:18:55.425
what feels good, tastes good, what
makes them happy, rather than loving

00:18:55.425 --> 00:18:57.284
God and his plan for their life.

00:18:57.284 --> 00:18:58.544
Wow, that's an exhaustive list.

00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:02.175
I believe that Paul wrote down these 18.

00:19:02.175 --> 00:19:04.815
He probably had another 18 on
him, but he figured he would stop

00:19:04.815 --> 00:19:08.815
them because they are well-rounded
on this idea of the first.

00:19:09.765 --> 00:19:13.995
Lovers of self when we think
about that word, lovers of self.

00:19:14.685 --> 00:19:15.225
Think about this.

00:19:15.225 --> 00:19:24.405
God calls us to love him and
to love others as ourself, but

00:19:24.405 --> 00:19:28.995
if we love ourselves the most,
we will not love God or people.

00:19:29.595 --> 00:19:30.315
Let me say that again.

00:19:30.585 --> 00:19:33.945
God calls us to love him and to
love others as ourselves, but if

00:19:33.945 --> 00:19:37.515
we love ourselves most, then we
will not love God or love other.

00:19:38.565 --> 00:19:39.855
. Warren Weby says it this way.

00:19:39.885 --> 00:19:44.325
In the universe, there is God, and
there are people and there are things,

00:19:44.985 --> 00:19:48.945
and we should worship God, love
people and use things, but hear this.

00:19:49.455 --> 00:19:52.125
But if we start worshiping
ourselves, we'll ignore God.

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:54.495
We'll start loving things
and we'll start using people.

00:19:54.975 --> 00:19:56.595
Man that hit home with me.

00:19:57.495 --> 00:19:58.275
You wanna know why?

00:19:58.995 --> 00:19:59.955
Cause times I'm selfish.

00:20:00.995 --> 00:20:01.425
Straight up.

00:20:01.845 --> 00:20:03.435
Your pastor is selfish at times.

00:20:05.805 --> 00:20:07.155
And this is like man.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.710
But I love God, and that's
where conviction comes in.

00:20:10.889 --> 00:20:13.800
This is where repentance is beautiful
because in those moments when God

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.340
convicts me and I repent and I
turn, there's something beautiful,

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.180
God's true design relationship with
him and the freedom from that sin.

00:20:21.629 --> 00:20:22.440
He goes on to say this.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.370
This is Warren weird.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:28.870
He goes on to say this, this formula
of, again, loving self, ignoring

00:20:28.875 --> 00:20:30.360
God and using people, right?

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.970
This formula is miserable life, yet
it characterizes many people today.

00:20:38.055 --> 00:20:41.865
So basically saying this, that people
begin to place themselves in God's

00:20:42.315 --> 00:20:46.575
position and begin to place God
second or not even in the running.

00:20:47.355 --> 00:20:51.165
But here's the shocker guys, and I, I
really, I, I want us to hear this and I

00:20:51.165 --> 00:20:52.725
wanna make sure I clearly preach this.

00:20:52.725 --> 00:20:53.655
This is the tough part.

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:54.495
You're ready for this one?

00:20:54.525 --> 00:20:55.305
Verse five.

00:20:57.585 --> 00:21:02.535
These people hold to the form of
godliness, but deny its power.

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:05.505
Let me translate to
you this, these people.

00:21:06.255 --> 00:21:10.605
Who do these things hold the
form of following Jesus, but

00:21:10.605 --> 00:21:12.345
yet deny their his works.

00:21:14.325 --> 00:21:18.195
You know, that was the hardest verse
because it would be easy for me as

00:21:18.195 --> 00:21:23.025
a follower of Jesus for him to say,
and these people do not know Jesus.

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:25.875
Never f like they, they've
never been around Jesus.

00:21:25.875 --> 00:21:28.875
This is just who they are and
they need people to love them

00:21:29.025 --> 00:21:30.255
and share Jesus with them.

00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:32.895
No, these are people that he
would almost say are in the.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:39.020
That are, that are living the religious
life that would claim to be religious

00:21:39.025 --> 00:21:44.730
or faithful in faith, but are denying
God's power and living in the flesh.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:56.670
That's a tough, tough thing to hear, but
even we can get trapped and living the

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.500
life that God does not have design for us.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.390
Here's the cool part, God.

00:22:01.435 --> 00:22:02.670
. God is not kicking you out.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.649
God is not turning you away.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:05.550
God loves you.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.889
And we're gonna talk a little
bit more about this, and

00:22:07.889 --> 00:22:08.909
this is the tough part here.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.389
He says, to avoid these people, somebody,
somebody gonna ask the same question

00:22:15.389 --> 00:22:16.830
I asked, isn't that un-Christian?

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:19.440
Like, did anybody think that?

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.760
That was the first question I had.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.590
I mean, if, if, if we avoid the people
that are living in sin, especially

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.990
those who know God or claim to know.

00:22:29.475 --> 00:22:30.555
Isn't that a bad thing?

00:22:31.485 --> 00:22:34.155
Is Paul speaking against
what Jesus would say?

00:22:34.995 --> 00:22:35.445
No.

00:22:35.895 --> 00:22:36.375
Praise God.

00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:37.875
I'm glad we can clarify that one.

00:22:37.875 --> 00:22:38.985
Let's, let's talk about this.

00:22:40.455 --> 00:22:42.435
We have to look back and
I, I'm gonna quote again.

00:22:42.435 --> 00:22:43.365
This is, I want you to understand this.

00:22:43.365 --> 00:22:46.785
I'm quoting somebody that is
non-biblical, but it's affirming

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.465
what Paul is saying here.

00:22:48.555 --> 00:22:50.895
If we go back to this quote of
Jim Rohm, he says, show me your

00:22:50.895 --> 00:22:51.885
friends and I'll show you your.

00:22:53.399 --> 00:23:00.030
If we spend time and time and time
and invest our lives around people

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:03.720
who are constant living in disregard
to God's will for their life in

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.879
sin, tell me what will happen.

00:23:05.879 --> 00:23:09.180
Somebody you're do the same thing.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:14.520
So it's not that you don't love
them, but it's that you love Jesus.

00:23:15.885 --> 00:23:17.475
And the effect that that
person can have on your life.

00:23:17.475 --> 00:23:19.875
And it doesn't mean that you do
not have a relationship with them.

00:23:19.875 --> 00:23:22.844
And the fact of, of knowing them and
continuing to preach Jesus and to share

00:23:22.844 --> 00:23:27.584
it in truth, but these would typically
be people that you have already spent

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.834
time with, shared the truth with.

00:23:31.004 --> 00:23:34.875
They're choosing not to repent and
move forward and changing their lives,

00:23:35.445 --> 00:23:38.625
and because of that rejection, you've
chose to now say, I'm still here

00:23:38.625 --> 00:23:44.264
anytime you need me, but I need to
be here and I need to follow Jesus.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.310
To be able to live the life
that God's called me to live.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.180
And not in a way that's saying, I
don't love you, or Jesus doesn't.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:56.400
He does, and I'm here at any moment you
need, but I cannot spend my days and my

00:23:56.405 --> 00:24:01.860
nights consistently being around someone
who is living outside of God's will

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.050
that even claims to be in God's will.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.960
That is, I'm telling you, it's
a tough conversation that you

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.920
may have to have with somebody.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.780
I know this stuff is difficult.

00:24:10.905 --> 00:24:13.245
But we know that if we do spend
time with them, we'll be sucked

00:24:13.245 --> 00:24:14.205
into those same patterns.

00:24:14.205 --> 00:24:15.225
So lemme give you some examples.

00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:18.825
If you hang around negative people
too long, what do you become negative?

00:24:18.825 --> 00:24:19.605
Let's go to the second one.

00:24:19.755 --> 00:24:24.345
If you hang around people that are not
speaking wisely, so cussing probably

00:24:24.345 --> 00:24:26.955
sexual things that shouldn't be said,
what what's gonna tend to happen?

00:24:27.195 --> 00:24:27.615
Anybody?

00:24:28.275 --> 00:24:29.745
You're gonna tend to
say those same things.

00:24:29.745 --> 00:24:31.515
You're gonna talk about those same things.

00:24:31.725 --> 00:24:33.015
Let, let's just go a little bit more.

00:24:33.195 --> 00:24:35.985
If you hang around people who
are lovers of self too long,

00:24:35.985 --> 00:24:38.715
what do you become selfish.

00:24:41.625 --> 00:24:42.165
Here's the thing.

00:24:42.165 --> 00:24:45.585
I don't know if you've even not in my
last year, I've had some different groups

00:24:45.585 --> 00:24:47.985
of people because as I continue to be
more and more out in the community,

00:24:48.255 --> 00:24:50.865
the more and more time I spend with the
people in the community and those that

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.085
are far from God and those that are
close to God, there's times where I've

00:24:53.085 --> 00:24:56.415
had to separate myself and not because I
don't love them, I'm still around them.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.475
I still see them, but I don't
spend as much time with them.

00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:04.395
Dedicated time when they're
discussing or living in such a way

00:25:04.395 --> 00:25:05.865
that would be dishonoring to God.

00:25:05.985 --> 00:25:08.715
Because it has influenced me, because
it's influenced the way that I think,

00:25:08.925 --> 00:25:10.245
because at times I've become greedy.

00:25:11.265 --> 00:25:12.645
Oh, even your pastor becomes greedy.

00:25:12.645 --> 00:25:13.095
Yeah.

00:25:13.515 --> 00:25:13.935
Why?

00:25:14.415 --> 00:25:18.135
Because they were greedy and, and again,
this is not me just like, oh, you sinner.

00:25:18.135 --> 00:25:18.735
This is me.

00:25:18.735 --> 00:25:21.795
Even speaking truth to them saying, Hey
guys, like I don't need to be greeting.

00:25:21.795 --> 00:25:22.455
We shouldn't be greed.

00:25:22.575 --> 00:25:23.775
You're trying to speak life.

00:25:23.775 --> 00:25:27.720
And if the life's not being received
at that moment,  again, telling

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.630
them that they're bad people,
that you don't ever love them.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.710
It's just trying to, to live in such a way
that, again, would honor God and benefit

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.570
yourself and your calling in your life.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.430
So here's what Paul's basically saying.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:43.560
Hard times will come to us because
of the sinfulness around us that can

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.340
influence us so much that we dishonor
Christ and is calling in our lives.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.500
We need to know that.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.209
And the lives of those around us
will be influenced if we continue

00:25:53.209 --> 00:25:54.419
to allow these influences happen.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.139
Our family, our friends, those who
don't know Christ, I would say this.

00:25:58.139 --> 00:26:01.169
If we continue to surround ourselves
with influences that don't honor

00:26:01.175 --> 00:26:03.060
God, we are playing with fire.

00:26:03.659 --> 00:26:08.129
Some of you are pyros that doesn't maybe
land with you, but you understand this.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.179
My grandma was that and
she set our field on fire.

00:26:12.179 --> 00:26:14.429
My grandpa's, you know, 30 acre field.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.939
And it's a bad thing
because that could happen.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.990
But we think we have it under
control because I didn't, you

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.919
know, this is what happens.

00:26:22.919 --> 00:26:26.040
I know you guys, Kari can't see these
lines when it comes to a sinful life.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:26.820
You know what we like to do?

00:26:27.179 --> 00:26:29.070
Can I get my foot as close
as I can to that line?

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:29.740
Is that sin?

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.189
Can somebody confirm the citizens of sin?

00:26:32.195 --> 00:26:33.750
Because if this isn't sin,
I'm gonna hang out here.

00:26:35.189 --> 00:26:36.419
That that's what we wanna do.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:41.939
And I'm just telling you why even
tempt yourself, why even do that?

00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:43.439
So we're gonna continue to go on here.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.850
How did these sinful people.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.180
People in Paul's day, and I'm gonna try
to be a little bit quicker with this

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.270
because you're probably gonna see these
in verses six and seven and go, this

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.710
doesn't really make sense to maybe us.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.610
So he sit here in verses six and seven,
he says, for among them are those who

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.850
worm their way into households and
deceive, gullible women, overwhelmed

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:04.470
by sins and are led astray by a variety
of passions, always learning and never

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.360
able to come to the knowledge of truth.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:12.150
So in Paul's day, we see these women
who were struggling in their sin.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:17.340
And here's the thing that I think is so,
They were desiring to live pure lives.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:22.080
It says this, that they were trained
to always learn, they were pursuing

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.830
truth, but they invited these men into
their lives that were not a positive

00:27:26.835 --> 00:27:32.490
influence, and these men distracted
them away from overcoming their sin.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.870
They allowed someone into their life that
was not godly, maybe had the perception

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.150
of godliness, and it stopped them.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.250
It pre prevented them from overcoming.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.340
What was the knowledge of truth that
they were stopping them from, right?

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.880
That they could actually live out
their faith and overcome their sin.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.480
I I, I think sometimes, again, as a
church, and this is something even in

00:27:51.485 --> 00:27:56.400
my own life, we can get so caught up
in coming to church and hearing the

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.620
truth and feeling spiritual enough just
with having the truth, but that was

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.720
these ladies, they heard the truth.

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.520
They knew they could overcome their sins.

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:09.720
They had the truth, but they could
never overcome by living out the.

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:12.900
By repenting of their sense
and moving on from it.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:17.550
And Paul says, avoid these people
because this is the influence that

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.720
they've had in the church and, and
how they've influenced other people.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.880
So again, if we put it another way,
coming to church on Sunday and enjoying

00:28:26.885 --> 00:28:30.750
the message is easy, but putting the
message into practice is difficult.

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.080
When he says, these hard times are
coming, the hard times are coming

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.190
to actually live out our faith.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.460
Y'all, I, I, I wanna be.

00:28:38.395 --> 00:28:40.995
I think more direct than I
probably have been in a long time.

00:28:42.435 --> 00:28:50.865
We cannot just claim a faith
in Jesus and sit and think it's

00:28:50.865 --> 00:28:53.625
just gonna grow and flourish.

00:28:54.254 --> 00:28:56.955
Life's, you know, you're gonna fall
after God easily just sitting back.

00:28:56.955 --> 00:28:57.705
No, you have to.

00:28:58.004 --> 00:29:00.014
You have to work at it.

00:29:00.675 --> 00:29:01.605
It's the same thing with marriage.

00:29:01.605 --> 00:29:06.014
You can't just say, I do it the
alter and sit back and not work.

00:29:07.455 --> 00:29:11.985
And not pursue your spouse
because it will never work.

00:29:12.825 --> 00:29:15.165
We'll end up wandering,
we'll end up being deceived.

00:29:17.085 --> 00:29:20.415
So it's difficult to do this
because there's people all around

00:29:20.415 --> 00:29:23.625
us trying to deceive us and
make us feel bad for our faith.

00:29:24.645 --> 00:29:27.794
I think that's the problem in the church
is we, we go out into the world and as

00:29:27.794 --> 00:29:30.825
we get around the world or we get around
other believers, they begin to say this

00:29:30.825 --> 00:29:32.925
and they'll say, so why do you care?

00:29:34.125 --> 00:29:35.415
Like studying your Bible every day?

00:29:35.415 --> 00:29:36.795
Like what does it really matter?

00:29:36.795 --> 00:29:37.875
I mean, God, you're saved.

00:29:38.205 --> 00:29:39.420
Why does it matter if you Ms.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.325
Church the next six Sundays?

00:29:41.895 --> 00:29:43.335
I mean, you're still saved.

00:29:43.455 --> 00:29:44.205
You're good.

00:29:44.535 --> 00:29:46.785
I mean, what does it matter that you pray?

00:29:47.265 --> 00:29:50.205
I mean, God's gonna do whatever
he wants to do because we place

00:29:50.205 --> 00:29:53.175
ourselves around people that begin
to now negatively influence us.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:58.705
And, and, and so, you know, in my heart,
I'm a people pleaser and maybe you're not.

00:29:59.355 --> 00:30:01.395
So I get around people and they start
telling me that, and it's almost

00:30:01.395 --> 00:30:02.265
like, I just wanna please them.

00:30:02.265 --> 00:30:03.285
So I'll, I'll do the right.

00:30:03.705 --> 00:30:04.575
Okay, I'll do what you say.

00:30:05.505 --> 00:30:06.315
Yeah, I'll miss that.

00:30:06.975 --> 00:30:10.425
And it's so difficult, and
Matthew seven tells us this.

00:30:10.935 --> 00:30:15.705
Matthew seven 13 and 14 says this
inter through the narrow gate for the

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:18.525
gate is wide and the road is broad.

00:30:18.585 --> 00:30:20.205
That leads to destruction.

00:30:21.405 --> 00:30:22.635
There are many that will go through it.

00:30:23.295 --> 00:30:26.565
How narrow is the gate and difficult
is the road that leads to life.

00:30:26.895 --> 00:30:28.065
Few will find it.

00:30:29.265 --> 00:30:35.565
It is hard sometimes to reject sometimes
the outside noise that's telling you,

00:30:36.345 --> 00:30:37.875
don't fall after Jesus like that.

00:30:38.355 --> 00:30:40.035
Don't live a faithful life like that.

00:30:40.455 --> 00:30:43.695
No, it's okay to sin in
this way cuz you know God.

00:30:43.695 --> 00:30:45.495
That's why Jesus died on the
cross so he could forgive you sin.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.175
So the more you sin, the
more he gets to forgive you.

00:30:47.175 --> 00:30:47.715
Isn't that what?

00:30:48.255 --> 00:30:49.035
Isn't that the plan?

00:30:49.845 --> 00:30:50.115
No.

00:30:50.115 --> 00:30:54.465
The plan is actually to forgive you and
change you so that you don't need sin.

00:30:54.585 --> 00:30:55.785
You don't need to pursue those.

00:30:57.585 --> 00:30:59.774
So, lemme just give you a couple
examples as we move forward here.

00:31:00.044 --> 00:31:02.925
When I first became a follower of
Jesus, me and Brittany were just now

00:31:02.925 --> 00:31:04.425
starting to get involved into a church.

00:31:05.294 --> 00:31:07.395
And after we gave our life to
Jesus, we started attending

00:31:07.395 --> 00:31:08.625
church even on Sunday nights.

00:31:09.044 --> 00:31:10.485
Crazy, crazy.

00:31:10.485 --> 00:31:11.685
We did it then.

00:31:11.685 --> 00:31:14.564
We wanted to go on Wednesday
nights too, and we wanted to go

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.455
to small group at nine o'clock.

00:31:16.764 --> 00:31:18.435
But you know what ended up happening?

00:31:18.465 --> 00:31:21.585
The friends group of friends that we
were around, uh, we hung out with 'em on

00:31:21.585 --> 00:31:23.985
Fridays and Saturday nights, and you guys
know what happens on Fridays and Saturday.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.180
We stay up too late and we probably do
things we probably shouldn't do, but we

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:32.610
would try to hang out with these group
of friends and we just found that it was

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.940
negatively influencing our lives because
our passion, our desire was to know Jesus

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:39.810
and to live like Jesus and, and we were
still friends with them, but we had to

00:31:39.815 --> 00:31:42.540
separate ourselves from those places.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.960
I remember when we started going to
church consistently on Sunday morning.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.740
You know what Sunday mornings were when
we actually got family together at home.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.530
We got family together on Sunday
mornings and we started telling 'em,

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:53.460
no, we're gonna go to church first.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.270
And that bothered them.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:55.380
Well, that's family time.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.970
Can't you dismiss one Sunday?

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.100
Can't you dismiss this Sunday?

00:31:59.105 --> 00:32:01.710
I remember that was when we went to
play golf with my grandpa, my brother.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.180
Can't you dismiss one Sunday for golf?

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.180
I could, and I'm not saying golf's
bad, but I'm like, can we go at.

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:08.400
Can we go at one?

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.360
Can I come over at one?

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.640
And that was a difficult
transition for some.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.790
And you may think that sounds very
religious and what you're, no.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:18.930
My commitment was to grow in my faith
and I had to say no to things that were

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.820
people who were influential in my life.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.730
I remember when I gave my life to
Christ and then I started to ministry.

00:32:23.735 --> 00:32:25.920
And my boss, this is what he
basically told me, you're foolish.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.070
You're foolish for wanting
to, to surrender your life to

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.300
ministry and quit this job.

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:30.930
And I'm.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.850
All right, here's my two weeks.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:35.040
I'm, I'm going like, I mean, it's tough.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.490
It's gonna be hard, but we all will
have those instances where somebody

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.850
will try to negatively influence
us, but we have to push back.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.760
Here's what I believe and I
hope that you believe as well.

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:48.870
For me and Brittany in that season,
we believe and have now experienced

00:32:48.875 --> 00:32:54.290
that God's ways are not restrictions
from enjoying life and having.

00:32:55.425 --> 00:32:59.475
No, they were an open door to
experience freedom and what we were

00:32:59.475 --> 00:33:02.925
truly designed for, and it is so
much better than what we left behind.

00:33:02.925 --> 00:33:06.615
I'm gonna say this again because I
want you to hear this so many times.

00:33:06.615 --> 00:33:08.535
You say, well, all you're
saying is just say, no sin.

00:33:08.775 --> 00:33:11.265
You're just telling me not to do all
these fun things that just make me feel

00:33:11.265 --> 00:33:12.675
good and the things I really enjoyed.

00:33:12.675 --> 00:33:13.245
No, no, no, no, no.

00:33:13.875 --> 00:33:15.285
You're missing God's best.

00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:15.975
I'm gonna say this again.

00:33:16.125 --> 00:33:18.915
We believe this is something me and
and Brittany have experienced, we

00:33:18.915 --> 00:33:21.615
believe and have now experienced
that God's ways are not restrictions

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:22.725
from enjoying life and having.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:27.750
No, they were an open door to
experience freedom and what we truly

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:31.620
were designed for, and it was so
much better than what we left behind.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:34.770
Someone needs to hear this, and
I, I, I, I don't know who it is.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:35.730
I wrote this in my notes.

00:33:35.735 --> 00:33:36.600
Somebody needs to hear this.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.220
Stop.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:39.150
Stop it.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.130
Stop trying to please someone else.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:46.350
There's one person that you were the
police and that is the Lord Jesus.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.090
Stop it.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:49.980
Oh man.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.330
Like maybe that frees you.

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:52.770
That frees me.

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.679
That means whenever I go out and
the influences around, I don't care

00:33:56.429 --> 00:33:58.439
because God has something greater.

00:33:58.949 --> 00:34:00.270
God has something greater.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.040
So Paul's saying, stop letting people
negatively influence your life.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:08.940
Stop allowing them to control you
and the relationship with Christ.

00:34:10.049 --> 00:34:13.620
And so I wanna quickly finish this up
cuz I know I'm running outta time here.

00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:18.120
So who were these people that were leading
the charge of destruction in Paul's day?

00:34:18.299 --> 00:34:21.750
He doesn't name them, but he gives
some people, he compares them against.

00:34:22.605 --> 00:34:25.335
He compares them against
two people in Moses name.

00:34:26.114 --> 00:34:29.745
When you begin to study about this,
most believe as you begin to study

00:34:29.745 --> 00:34:33.254
a little bit about the history and
tradition that Janus and Jammers

00:34:33.614 --> 00:34:36.014
were actually the magicians who.

00:34:36.944 --> 00:34:41.384
With Paul or not Paul, with, with Moses
and Aaron, when they would cast down

00:34:41.384 --> 00:34:44.955
the, the staff and it would turn into a
snake and then magicians would cast down

00:34:44.955 --> 00:34:46.574
a staff and then there would be a snake.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.665
And it was always funny cuz then
Moses' snake and ate theirs.

00:34:49.665 --> 00:34:50.324
And that was kinda funny.

00:34:50.534 --> 00:34:54.435
But then they turned water into blood
and you know, Moses turned water into

00:34:54.435 --> 00:34:57.615
blood and like they kept duplicating, but
at some point they couldn't duplicate.

00:34:58.424 --> 00:34:59.115
What were they doing?

00:34:59.115 --> 00:35:01.185
They were imitating truth.

00:35:01.545 --> 00:35:02.235
They were imitating.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:08.700
So Paul begins to characterize these
men that were deceiving in the church

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:12.690
as imitators, and they resisted the
truth, he says, because they were

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.440
corrupt in mind and have become worthless
in their faith to be used by God.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.060
So what happened to them?

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.850
Here's what we do know, the enemy, Satan,
as you begin to go back into Genesis, the

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:27.240
enemy, Satan is an imitator, he's a liar.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:30.510
And so he begins to deceive people.

00:35:31.484 --> 00:35:35.595
Who have a form of godliness
to spread half truths.

00:35:35.625 --> 00:35:38.654
And I say half truths because
they seem godly, but what they

00:35:38.654 --> 00:35:40.785
are preaching is not Christ.

00:35:41.115 --> 00:35:42.285
They're not preaching repentance.

00:35:42.285 --> 00:35:45.585
They're not preaching salvation
the way that God is designed.

00:35:46.185 --> 00:35:49.125
So as for Janus and Jamas,
they were finally exposed.

00:35:49.125 --> 00:35:52.754
And so were the leaders in Paul's
day, and so will the leaders and

00:35:52.754 --> 00:35:56.145
those who are doing that today.

00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:58.725
And it's just this statement,
your sin will catch up.

00:35:59.775 --> 00:36:01.005
Your sin will catch up to you.

00:36:01.335 --> 00:36:05.205
In my days before my life in
Christ, and when I came to my life

00:36:05.205 --> 00:36:07.485
to Christ, I thought all my sins
were forgiven, which they were.

00:36:07.995 --> 00:36:10.875
But do you know, after I gave my life
to Christ, that I went through a season

00:36:10.995 --> 00:36:14.565
of a couple of years of dealing with
the consequences of my sins from the

00:36:14.565 --> 00:36:18.975
years before, your sins will catch up
to you, and they're not to punish you.

00:36:19.515 --> 00:36:25.301
They're to free you because when
forgiveness happens, oh, . I'll

00:36:25.306 --> 00:36:28.200
just tell you on the other side of
forgiveness, on the other side of

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:33.750
freedom, of, of hatred, and un oh
man, like my life changed so much.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.540
Galatians 67 38 says this before we
go into our, just finishing up here.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.190
He says this, don't be deceived.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.650
God is not mocked for whatever person.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:47.400
Sos, he also will reap because
the one who sows to his flesh will

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.630
reap destruction from the flesh,
but the one who sows to the spirit

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.400
will reap eternal life from the.

00:36:54.705 --> 00:36:56.685
Here's what we know every single day.

00:36:56.924 --> 00:37:02.045
You and me are being influenced
negatively and positively.

00:37:03.345 --> 00:37:07.965
So I continue to affirm this, and
you're not hearing this wrong.

00:37:08.565 --> 00:37:12.345
God is not saying, don't be around people
that are sinners, because guess what?

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:13.634
We wouldn't be able to
be around ourselves.

00:37:14.654 --> 00:37:19.245
What God is saying is that if you've
been around those people, And you've

00:37:19.245 --> 00:37:22.755
continued to pour into them and try to
live your light out around them, and

00:37:22.755 --> 00:37:26.475
they're rejecting truth and they're
beginning to influence you negatively.

00:37:26.505 --> 00:37:31.275
You need to separate yourself
for your good and for theirs.

00:37:31.485 --> 00:37:32.535
Here's what I'll tell you.

00:37:32.535 --> 00:37:36.015
You can't reach somebody by
joining them in their sin.

00:37:37.335 --> 00:37:42.315
You can reach somebody by being redeemed
for forgiven and broken through, broken

00:37:42.315 --> 00:37:45.765
free from that sin so that they can
see, oh man, maybe that could be me.

00:37:47.174 --> 00:37:48.345
But you can still love them.

00:37:49.275 --> 00:37:50.295
You can still support them.

00:37:50.295 --> 00:37:54.225
You can pray for them, you can still
encourage them, you can still be around

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:58.515
them, but you cannot allow them in the
area of influence that drives you away

00:37:58.515 --> 00:38:02.145
from a godly life that God has called
you to that is so much better for you.

00:38:02.174 --> 00:38:03.315
That's the picture today.

00:38:03.825 --> 00:38:05.565
That's the picture and it's so hard.

00:38:06.015 --> 00:38:08.654
But let me tell you this,
and this is critical.

00:38:08.835 --> 00:38:09.825
Don't miss this piece.

00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:14.685
You know where the enemy is gonna start
working in your life, your weaknesses.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.440
Sometimes we don't even know our
weaknesses until they pop up.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.620
For some of us, it's a relationship.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.260
For some of us it's pornography.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.200
For some of us, it's a substance.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:34.260
For some of us, it's, it's, it's a past
history of, of abuse and I guess, I

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.880
don't know what the story is for you.

00:38:36.745 --> 00:38:39.735
. But when that creeps up, it begins to
try to take control because the enemy's

00:38:39.735 --> 00:38:43.545
gonna use that to drive a divide between
you and other people and the church

00:38:43.694 --> 00:38:45.045
and your relationship with Jesus.

00:38:45.194 --> 00:38:47.895
And that is a dangerous place.

00:38:49.185 --> 00:38:50.055
But what does he say?

00:38:50.085 --> 00:38:50.565
Beware?

00:38:51.585 --> 00:38:52.694
Because we can prepare.

00:38:53.115 --> 00:38:54.134
We know it's coming.

00:38:54.255 --> 00:38:55.395
We know it is coming.

00:38:56.415 --> 00:39:00.975
When things are going good or God
wants to do something great, the enemy

00:39:00.975 --> 00:39:02.384
wants to come in and try to deceive.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:06.480
So I wanna give you three things to
pray for during this time of invitation.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.129
This is so critical invitation.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.890
I, I, I wanna explain it this way.

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:15.540
Almost every single week I've been a
part of churches, and this is not a knock

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.009
to them, but this is something for me.

00:39:17.015 --> 00:39:19.859
I, I want to hear to myself as well.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:23.430
Invitations not just a ritual we have,
because that's what you do at everything.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:26.370
End of church, everybody stands, we
have a worship song, and I'm supposed

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:27.660
to close my eyes and think about.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.040
Y'all know what I'm talking about,
and sometimes you're wondering,

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:32.970
what am I supposed to think about?

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:39.600
Invitation is an opportunity to say, Hey,
the word of God has spoke to me today.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:43.650
It is now time to reflect
and apply that to my life.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.250
And you ask the Lord that
question, what is it that needed

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:49.140
to take from today's word to it?

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.130
Apply to my life.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.100
From my benefit and for the
benefit of those around me.

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:56.490
So let me categorize three different
people, and I say three different

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:58.890
people cuz I think there could be nine
different groups of people in here.

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:02.460
But the first group that I really
want to focus on here is as a follower

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:06.450
of Jesus, if you've given your life
to Christ, you love Jesus, you have

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:11.340
committed your life to Christ, but you
still see some of these self-destructive

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:17.130
things in your life, if you see them
today, just, just so you know, today

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.200
is the opportunity that God has given.

00:40:20.009 --> 00:40:25.200
to overcome that sin, to repent
of it and turn from it today.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.569
Today is the day to move on.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.540
Don't wait till tomorrow, because
that's what the enemy's gonna do.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.160
He's gonna deceive you
to just keep waiting.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:36.060
Deal with it today, repentance is
on the other side and freedom's

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.049
on the other side, right?

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.310
God will forgive you.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:41.190
So during the sum of invitation, I want
you to pray and ask God to forgive you.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.620
If there's something in your heart
as you begin to read over this,

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.270
that you need to repent up and turn.

00:40:46.575 --> 00:40:49.305
Invite somebody into to maybe help you
be accountable to, I don't know what

00:40:49.305 --> 00:40:51.194
it is, but repent and turn from it.

00:40:51.375 --> 00:40:56.115
Number two, you may be somebody in
this room that is religious, and as

00:40:56.115 --> 00:41:01.214
Paul described it here in verse five,
that you hold a form of godliness,

00:41:01.575 --> 00:41:02.685
but you're denying as power.

00:41:02.714 --> 00:41:04.334
I don't know if there is, and
I don't know if you're in this

00:41:04.334 --> 00:41:06.194
room and I'm not calling you out.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.225
What I'm saying though, that may
be you and if it is you, you know

00:41:09.225 --> 00:41:12.845
God's giving you the same invitation
that you can truly turn from your.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:19.290
And follow after Jesus and accept what I
would love this picture, accept the power

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:23.850
that we receive from a true relationship
with Jesus to overcome our sins.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:29.070
If you're anything like me, I tried
fighting for a year to become sinless

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:35.130
by myself, and it took one day for me
to pray and say, God, I can't do it for

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:37.260
God to begin to change me in an instant.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:38.760
Maybe that's you today.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:39.990
I wanna call you to that.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:41.230
The last.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.100
Um, it's just somebody who knows.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.810
You walked in the store and
you're like, you know what?

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:46.620
I don't do church.

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.270
Never done Jesus.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:49.440
I don't even know who Jesus is.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.900
Maybe you just don't have a
spiritual background at all.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.590
Maybe that's you.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.860
God's calling you as well to just
give your life to Jesus today.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.210
Repent of your sins.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:57.930
Turn to him.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:03.480
I know some of this stuff is hard
for all of us, but I'll just tell

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:10.230
you a relationship with Jesus daily,
personally walking with him is so much.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:14.160
One than what the world has to
offer than what these sins, the

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.140
sins of selfishness have to offer.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.250
So I'm gonna pray for us and then we're
gonna take some time to seek the Lord

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.500
and see where our hearts need to be.

00:42:22.504 --> 00:42:25.770
Lord Jesus, we just pray, Lord,
that you have, um, spoke to

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:26.970
each one of us and me included.

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:30.600
Lord, I pray that as you bring things
to my remembrance, Lord, that I turn

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:35.009
from them, Lord, that I repent, that
I do not hang out in my sin because

00:42:35.009 --> 00:42:36.660
Lord, that sin is not valuable for me.

00:42:36.689 --> 00:42:38.399
And Lord, I pray for those in this room.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:45.990
Who may have been cut to the heart, Lord,
in, in an area of their life that is

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:51.540
not honoring to you, God, just be with
us and, and help us turn from our sins.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:58.140
But God, I, I really want to even, Lord,
I just wanna speak to those who are

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:03.510
struggling, Lord, in their sin of belief,
Lord, that they may see themselves in a

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:06.510
lot of these different areas and they have
not truly given their lives to you, Lord.

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:08.160
And here is my prayer that.

00:43:09.105 --> 00:43:12.585
Today be the day of salvation for
them, Lord, that today they know that

00:43:12.585 --> 00:43:15.795
they can repent of their sins, that
they can turn their lives to you,

00:43:16.365 --> 00:43:19.815
and that they can begin to experience
the freedom that they have in you.

00:43:20.505 --> 00:43:23.235
Lord, if that's that person today, Lord,
and they need to give their lives to

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.315
Christ, here's my prayer, Lord, that
I'm gonna be in the back of the room

00:43:27.375 --> 00:43:30.285
during this time of invitation and in
the back of the room, Lord, they come

00:43:30.285 --> 00:43:32.174
find me and they say, I need Jesus.

00:43:33.884 --> 00:43:34.065
Lord.

00:43:34.065 --> 00:43:35.835
I'm praying that person
has the boldness today to.

00:43:36.735 --> 00:43:39.825
Because everybody here celebrates
salvation and transformation.

00:43:41.055 --> 00:43:42.615
So Lord, give them the
boldness to do that.

00:43:42.615 --> 00:43:46.245
Lord, give those who are struggling
in sin, the boldness to repent and

00:43:46.245 --> 00:43:50.535
turn and ask for forgiveness to
experience the new freedom life, Lord,

00:43:50.535 --> 00:43:52.185
that you have for each one of us.

00:43:55.185 --> 00:43:58.605
God, we love you, and we thank you
so much for this time of invitation.

00:43:58.964 --> 00:44:01.605
Be able to consider the things
that you've taught us today and we

00:44:01.755 --> 00:44:02.535
pray this in your heavenly name.

00:44:03.165 --> 00:44:03.495
Amen.
