00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.380
We've been walking through, we started
this last week, we'll continue that

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.630
this week, and two more weeks in August.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.680
Um, but we have been walking
through, uh, Matthew chapter 7.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.550
Matthew chapter 7 is the last
chapter of the Sermon on the Mount.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.160
Um, we're gonna have the verses
up here today, but we'll be

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.370
in verses 7 through 12 today.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.060
And I'll be referencing several
other verses, so you'll see

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.360
those along the way as well.

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.989
Um, but in this Sermon on the Mount, uh,
we begin to see throughout the sermon

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.299
that there's a couple of different themes.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.980
And some things...

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.270
that we obviously need to cover in the
first couple chapters because we didn't

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.450
go through them was Jesus was really
gathering all of his disciples, all of

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.050
his followers together to be able to
teach them how to live in the kingdom of

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.000
God, how to live in the kingdom of God.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.250
Right?

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:43.710
He talks about the coming of the kingdom.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.600
He talks about God's rescue plan
for the world, uh, and he begins

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.620
to really just teach them practical
things that, that each one of them

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.140
could apply to their lives as they
live out these kingdom principles.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.930
And so we're kind of jumping in on the
back end of this sermon in chapter.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.180
But chapter 7 stuck out to me.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.920
The reason why I thought it would be
good for us to discuss is chapter 7 has

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.140
a lot of those verses that either people
misquote or they don't like to even talk

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.460
about because they're difficult verses.

00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:19.380
And so used to, you guys know me a lot,
probably not, maybe, but this idea of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.050
verses that are difficult in the Bible,
I typically would just avoid those.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.810
Especially early on in
my preaching journey.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.530
It's like, why go over those?

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.840
Because I'm probably not going to
have any clue how to preach them.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.980
Um, and nowadays...

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.070
I kind of get excited because I'm
like, you know, these are the ones that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.490
people probably actually reading them.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.670
I really would love to
talk more about this.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.740
And so last week we talked
about judging, right?

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.229
Judge not unless you be judged.

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.720
And that's one of those misquoted,
uh, a lot of times were misapplied,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.000
uh, verses in the Bible.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.980
Um, and then today we're going
to talk about this idea behind

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.300
asking, seeking, and knocking that
if we'll ask that we will receive.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.480
And this is where we
start getting into this.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.140
We have two sides of the people of
what they called the name and claimant,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.720
which means if you name it and you ask
it, you will receive it no matter what.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.780
And if you don't receive it,
it's your fault because you

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.380
didn't have enough faith.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.490
Anybody ever heard that before?

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.910
No?

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.510
Okay.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.430
Well then you haven't probably been in
the charismatic side of the church before.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.679
But, um, you'll also see people that
will see this and then they're gonna say,

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:15.319
Well, you know, I'm afraid to even ask
God because I've asked Him before and He

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.829
hasn't answered and I don't believe Him.

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.410
So then they kind of
just ignore this verse.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.140
Or maybe even an
unbeliever would say that.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.869
So, we see kind of a couple different
perspectives on this specific

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.049
text that we're gonna cover today.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.200
But we're gonna learn
that God gives good gifts.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.530
And I would say this, God always God
always gives good gifts and we're

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.299
gonna see where the Bible affirms
that and we'll see also, um, that

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.480
God, when we think about asking, um,
He always answers whether we like

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.109
the answer or not, and I think that's
what we'll probably learn today.

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:46.880
So, when we think about God giving
good gifts, and this is where I'm gonna

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.510
include you guys to give some feedback,
when you think of something good,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.649
right, when you would define something
good, how would you define good?

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.090
Somebody go ahead and
share something with me.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.220
How would you define good?

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:00.489
Preach joy.

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:01.130
Preach joy.

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.070
You're happy when it happens.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.140
Things go alright.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.880
Brings a smile to your face.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.000
See, I think most of us would probably
say the perspective of good is

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.470
something that brings value to me.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.989
But, now I want to kind of
flip it a little bit here.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.570
How do you think, this is kind of
precursor to where we're going.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.470
How do you think God defines good?

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.960
Okay, good.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.230
What's best for your life?

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:38.429
What was that?

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.890
Value.

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:39.409
Value.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.570
It's about more people than yourself.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.380
Anybody else?

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.690
Most of you are probably just
like, yeah, okay, that's right.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.780
So, that's what we're
going to dive into today.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.180
Because I think when we think
about our good, what we think

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.489
is good, and what God thinks is
good, sometimes doesn't match up.

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.300
And if you're anything like
me, that's hard to reconcile.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.510
When what I think is good and what
God thinks is good doesn't match up, I

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.580
begin to really question God, I begin to
question my faith, I begin to question

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.720
And so I think this is a difficult text
because understanding God's good is

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.100
the greatest good for us is sometimes
a lesson that is hard to learn, right?

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.240
And so, um, something that, some things
just to kind of take home, I want to

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.570
kind of put them up front and then
we'll continue to walk through them.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.840
Something that you'll hear about
today is this idea behind God's

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.960
perspective is not limited.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.900
When we think about what is good, God's
perspective is not limited, right?

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.489
He's the alpha and omega,
the beginning and the end.

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.229
His perspective.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.760
is allowed to see everything
all at the same time.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.330
But our perspective is narrow.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.609
It's limited.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.599
And so when God defines good, he sees
this whole picture, not just our lives.

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:52.539
Right?

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.520
And so I think that's something
that we'll continue to think through

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.639
as we go through this message.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.770
So let's read the verses and then jump in.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.550
So he says this in verse
seven, Matthew chapter seven.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.960
It says, ask and it will be given to you.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.150
Seek and you will find.

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.869
Knock and the door will be opened to you.

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:10.419
Forever.

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.710
Everyone who asks, receives.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.950
For the one who seeks, finds.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.229
And to the one who knocks,
the door will be opened.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.060
Who among you, if his son asks him
for bread, will give him a stone?

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.510
Or if he asks for a fish,
will give him a snake?

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:32.020
If you then, who are evil, know how to
give good gifts to your children, how

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.970
much more will your Father in Heaven give
you good things to those who ask Him?

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.760
Therefore, whatever you want
from others, to do for you.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.810
Do also the same for them, for
this is the law and the prophets.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.380
So let's pray.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.840
Lord Jesus, we just pray, Lord,
as we dive into your word, Lord,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.120
that you help us understand it.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.179
Um, Lord, I just pray that we,
um, leave out of here, uh, with

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:57.999
new understanding of what it means
to ask and to seek and to not.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.860
And Lord, I just pray that we
apply that to our lives and we

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.100
experience you in a new way.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.480
And we just pray this
in your heavenly name.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:04.300
Amen.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.260
So how does God give good gifts?

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.159
I think it's pretty simple.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.610
The text clarifies that to
ask and we seek and we not.

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.550
Um, and I, and I think what is really
cool is he's speaking to his believers

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.800
and he's really challenging, again,
the believers and disciples he's

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.840
speaking to that day, he's really
challenging them to approach God.

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:26.530
Now think about this, at Old Testament
times, it was scary to approach God.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.449
You, if you really didn't approach
God, you would actually use a priest to

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.250
approach God because you were too guilty
of your sin and you were too broken.

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:36.710
Um, and so many people were very
humbled by even approaching God.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.400
And so Jesus is kind of
changing the scenario for them.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.479
Hey, approach God.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.250
Ask.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.610
Seek.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.870
Even knock on his door.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.810
Uh, and so that was interesting
when we think about how he's

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.979
challenged them to do that.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.590
And I started thinking this question
Do you struggle to ask God for things?

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.979
Anybody?

00:06:58.809 --> 00:06:59.289
A couple of you?

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:02.190
Does anybody not struggle with asking God?

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.090
Like you're totally cool.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.440
Yeah, I'm cool.

00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:05.830
Great.

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:07.669
Again, I think that's great.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.819
What I would find though is that a
lot of people struggle to approach

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.729
God for a couple of different reasons.

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:15.820
Now I think that's why Jesus is even
approaching this in this idea of most

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.169
people are afraid to approach God.

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:20.820
And I believe one of the reasons
why is because we think that

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.009
it may inconvenience God.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:29.319
Think about it this way is, you know, what
I want to ask God for is, you know, maybe

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:31.360
tomorrow for my kids not to act so bad.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.680
Like that's so small.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.460
I mean there's people
that are dying of hunger.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.120
I don't even want to approach God.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.070
So you're afraid to even ask
God those questions because

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.199
you're like, it's just so small.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.960
So maybe that's one reason why
you would want to approach God.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.030
I think the other one could be is
that he doesn't have time for me.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.640
He doesn't have time for me,
it's a waste of his time, uh,

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.950
because he's God, and I'm not.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.530
And so, maybe he, to you,
is not approachable in it.

00:07:55.949 --> 00:07:58.309
But I would say maybe here
is where some of us land.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.249
And this is maybe where I land, and
so maybe I'm just kind of assuming

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.310
this, but in some conversations I
would say I would relate with this.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.780
We don't approach God
because we lack faith.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.430
And we usually lack faith that
God will respond to what we ask.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:20.280
Because we say he has not answered me
before or his answer that he gave me

00:08:20.359 --> 00:08:24.710
I didn't like anybody ever Received
those answers from god you asked and

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.309
the answer you got you didn't like
And so we begin to say, you know what?

00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:32.150
I don't like it I I'm afraid
to even approach god because

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.439
I don't even want the answer.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.070
So I just avoid it Altogether and so I
would call this really a lack of faith

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.810
And I really want to challenge this idea
today with faith because I think this is

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:45.820
part of the asking that god's gonna We're
gonna Today, it's this idea behind faith

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.980
when we ask, knowing we've received it.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.380
So faith is seeing what God sees,
even when though we don't see it.

00:08:54.069 --> 00:08:58.560
So when we're asking God to move in
our lives in an area, it's believing

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.420
that God is already answered.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.410
That even if you don't see it today
because you believe that God is

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.819
good and God is working, despite
sometimes what we see in our lives,

00:09:08.939 --> 00:09:11.189
and Hebrews 11, six reminds us of this.

00:09:11.189 --> 00:09:14.040
He says this now without faith, it is.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.439
Possible to please God since the one who
draws near to him must believe that he

00:09:19.439 --> 00:09:22.590
exists and he rewards those who seek him.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.490
So we see just even in this text, this
idea behind faith is what pleases God.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:32.100
So when we seek and when we ask,
and when we knock in faith, he

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.720
says that he will reward, reward
us and he will respond to us.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.380
Um, and again, when we think
about that may be hard for us to

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.870
think through when we think about
asking, because sometimes we ask

00:09:42.875 --> 00:09:44.520
halfheartedly, we don't really believe.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.650
We just kind of do it out
of ritual or repetition.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.839
So let's kind of dive into these verses
and see these words and really see what

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.729
it means to ask and to seek and to knock.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.270
And I think the way that we
dive into this, we have to

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.199
think of a couple of things.

00:09:58.199 --> 00:09:59.580
Number one is context.

00:10:00.149 --> 00:10:02.820
And the reason why I say this is most of
these verses, if we go back to last week,

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.270
don't judge unless you've been judged.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.910
Context is important.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.460
And context is a big word, so
I want to define that for you.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.220
Context is the parts of something
written or spoken that was

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.879
immediately preceding the passage.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.010
Passage to clarify its meaning.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:17.760
I'm gonna say that again.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.430
Context is the parts of something written
or spoken that immediately proceeded

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.890
a passage to clarify its meaning.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.400
So when we think about this whole sermon
on the Mount, in order to approach

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.060
God and ask him, we have to kind of
know what he's been saying before

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.220
to understand how the asking goes.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.950
Well, whenever you think about
asking, seeking and knocking, I

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.630
kind of associate those with prayer.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.610
Does anybody else kinda associate
those things with prayer?

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.460
Well, Jesus actually
spoke on prayer back in.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.350
And the cool part is, Dave, if you were
here for the two weeks that Dave came

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.320
in and preached for me a couple weeks
ago, he talked about that prayer text.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.520
And in that prayer text,
this is what Jesus said.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.470
He says, you ought to pray this, he says,
ask for God's kingdom to come for his will

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.509
to be done in heaven as it is on earth.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.700
That was one of the things that he
said to ask, he said, to ask for your

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:10.300
daily needs, ask God to forgive you,
ask God to help you forgive others.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.220
He says to ask God to
deliver you from evil things.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.110
So when we look at this asking.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.770
Seeking and knocking those are the
things in which he's suggesting

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.420
and pointing us towards asking.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.940
And really, when we think about
this, he says, may God's key to

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.640
be done made his will be done.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:26.900
Really?

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.540
That's a broad picture when we
think about in the acts asking,

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.960
but if you go on even further in
Matthew chapter six, you'll also see

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.070
later on where he talks about this.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:41.030
He says, seek first the kingdom of God
and his righteousness, and then all

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.159
of these things will be added to you.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.220
So he's really talking about not
worrying about the things in which we.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.960
Need the essentials of our daily life
and so think about this This is where

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.840
God's saying you know in our asking ask
for your daily needs in what you need

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.590
He says seek first the kingdom of God.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:12:00.349
And so knowing this changes the way
in which we approach this test Texts

00:12:00.379 --> 00:12:04.560
and asking seeking and knocking and
so I think it's important for us to

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.500
take that into consideration So let's
jump in he says he gives us good gifts

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.799
when we ask seek and knock So let's
start with the word ask if you dive

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.970
into that word ask a little bit deeper.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.740
It's actually interesting Oh It's
even driven down to be this, it's

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.960
a desire, begging, or craving.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:25.330
So think about when we approach
God and we begin to ask, we truly

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:31.109
desire, we're begging to God,
we're craving a response from God.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.860
And when you dive even a little bit
further into that and kind of break

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.210
that down a little bit, our asking
really comes from a deep, deep desire

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.809
that I would say would be connected
to the Spirit of God inside of you.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.519
When we approach God, it's the Spirit
of God that actually interprets you.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.590
for us a lot of times.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.770
And he talks about this later on, um,
but he interprets our groanings at times.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.110
When we don't know what to say
when we pray, the Spirit of God is

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.079
interpreting or providing that for us.

00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:58.640
And so, what is God's
response when we ask?

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.119
And he clearly states it here.

00:13:00.119 --> 00:13:02.170
He says, it will be given to you.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.380
And I, I just tell you guys,
whenever I dive into these

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.560
things, this is a tough text.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.970
If you just read it from word
for word, it means just asking

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.770
God's going to give it to you.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.280
If you don't look at context, you
don't look at who God is as a whole,

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.530
that means I can ask for a person.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.250
Purple Corvette.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.140
I don't know why purple.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.020
Probably because that's what Peyton wants.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:20.340
But Purple Corvette.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.520
And I would receive it, right?

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.910
Based upon just reading this text at
face value, that should be true, right?

00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:28.009
But does anybody believe that's true?

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.959
If so, can somebody go outside
and check the, the parking lot?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.160
Because I hope I have a Purple
Corvette, and then we'll just

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.069
spend the rest of our time asking.

00:13:36.229 --> 00:13:36.800
It's yellow.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:37.619
It's yellow.

00:13:37.819 --> 00:13:38.130
Okay.

00:13:39.239 --> 00:13:40.689
We got the color off,
but I'll still take it.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:41.069
Okay?

00:13:41.849 --> 00:13:43.729
So, so it's not that simple.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.069
But that's why I look, and have
to dive into these words and he

00:13:47.069 --> 00:13:48.160
says, it will be given to you.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:48.500
Okay.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.770
So that tells me his word
says it will be given.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.739
If I ask and the word given is this
when we think about the word given

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.229
it dive out and a little bit deeper.

00:13:56.229 --> 00:13:59.660
He says these things that will
be given are to our advantage

00:13:59.699 --> 00:14:01.510
and necessary for our lives.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:07.219
So when we're asking we're asking for
things in which bring value to our

00:14:07.219 --> 00:14:11.319
lives and that really relates to if we
go back to Matthew 6, how do you pray

00:14:11.339 --> 00:14:16.030
seek first his kingdom and he says
also ask for your needs to be met.

00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:16.949
So that aligns.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.189
So we're not asking for a purple
Corvette because that's what we

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.199
really don't need the purple Corvette.

00:14:23.219 --> 00:14:24.050
We really want it.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.349
But there's things that we do
need, and so he says those things

00:14:26.349 --> 00:14:27.630
that we need will be given.

00:14:27.929 --> 00:14:30.270
And he even goes down in verse
80 and talks about this word,

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.160
Everyone who asks will receive.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:33.879
Everyone.

00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:36.390
And we think about this, and this
is another picture with this.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.800
He says everyone will receive.

00:14:38.969 --> 00:14:43.099
And I would think this way, everyone
has access to, or can take hold of.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.640
So, let me just give you a great example.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.920
If I ask.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.810
For something from God
that is a need in my life.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.579
Many times God will provide that need, but
sometimes not in the way that we want it.

00:14:55.459 --> 00:14:56.439
God will provide it.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:02.349
We have full access to it, but we
refuse to receive it because of we don't

00:15:02.349 --> 00:15:03.969
want to be humble in our receiving.

00:15:04.579 --> 00:15:06.480
We don't want to trust
God in our receiving.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:09.099
We don't like the way in
which he's given it to us.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.739
We don't like the answer
that God gives to us.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.800
So it's sitting there and it's not being
received because we aren't taking it.

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:17.419
So there's two parts to this.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.380
And we'll continue to see
that theme as we go on.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.969
So he says to seek,
not only ask, but seek.

00:15:21.969 --> 00:15:22.990
And that's totally different, right?

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.849
We're not just verbally asking, but
we're pursuing God in our asking.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.339
And it's interesting when
you look at the word seek.

00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:32.669
It also translates to crave.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.709
So if I see that word crave
twice in asking and in seeking,

00:15:36.709 --> 00:15:37.579
I think of it this way.

00:15:37.819 --> 00:15:39.970
Guys, when I'm hungry, I seek out food.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.040
There's nothing stopping me from
fulfilling the need that is deep

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.600
down in my stomach to fulfill
the fuel that I need in my body.

00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:49.510
There is a deep desire.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:53.980
Well, when we ask, we're asking and
we're seeking from that craving.

00:15:54.209 --> 00:15:57.949
That we desire to hear from God
and for God to move in our lives.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.799
So to crave or to strive
or to pursue after.

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:03.289
Does anybody know where
we should seek God?

00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:05.600
Where should we seek God?

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:05.759
Hmm?

00:16:08.659 --> 00:16:09.139
Everywhere.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:09.810
Everywhere?

00:16:10.319 --> 00:16:10.630
Yeah.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.050
But where does God speak to us?

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.540
My kids asked me this question last night.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:14.870
Dad?

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.199
When, uh, when you prayed about
coming to Cincinnati to plant a

00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:20.880
church, how did God answer you that?

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:21.730
That's a fun one, right?

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:22.710
How did God answer you?

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.740
Jesus, did He speak to you audibly?

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.490
I was like, no.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:30.480
But there was something inside of you,
there was a craving that as we were

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.340
pursuing God that there was a satisfaction
in the calling that God was calling us to.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.810
There was confirmation in His word
that He said that if we will go, if we

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.380
will go in faith that He will provide
everything that we need along the way.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.459
So when we think about seeking, it's
seeking His word, it's seeking His

00:16:47.489 --> 00:16:51.080
presence, it's genuinely looking for God.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:57.030
And not just how you want them to respond,
because a lot of times we'll say, God,

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.540
give me this, and if you don't give me
this, I will not listen to anything else

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:05.750
because ultimately it is his kingdom
and his will, but we're asking from the

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:10.069
spirit of God inside of us and the word
of God around us in faith, the things

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:12.069
that God says he will provide for us.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.060
And so God's response with the
seeking is you will find, right?

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.200
You will experience it,
see it and discover it.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.190
If you seek him, you will seek him.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.640
I think of knocking and taking action.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.200
Let me just give you
another example of this.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.350
Last week we had a mission team, we
were going door to door to invite some

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:36.850
people to um, next week we're doing
kind of a children's camp for Booker T.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.050
Washington which is a
great opportunity for us.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.189
So we're knocking on
doors to invite people in.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:43.560
And I'm kind of this weird person
because every single time I go up

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.820
to the door I think of what if I
was on the other side of the door?

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.420
Does anybody like their
door to get knocked on?

00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.629
No.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:51.920
We don't.

00:17:52.359 --> 00:17:53.200
But I'm doing it.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.640
But I'm doing it because I think it's
good, because there's a lot of kids

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.630
in this neighborhood that really need
Jesus and really just need to be loved

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.790
on, and I'm willing to, to risk being a
little bit forward knocking on that door.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:08.250
And so sometimes I'll catch myself,
depending on the door, because I'm a

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:12.479
little freaked out, knocking lightly,
hoping they don't answer something.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.119
I'll stick a card in
the door and run away.

00:18:15.939 --> 00:18:18.280
Don't, don't judge me, but it happens.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.180
But you know, I was going with this
group and there's one lady in this

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.500
group, she just had a boldness about her.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.939
She'd walk up to the door.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.420
TCH TCH TCH TCH TCH And I'm like,
Somebody's going to run out and

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:31.320
be like, What are you doing?

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.320
And you know how many times
more people answered her doors?

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.940
Because she was intentional.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:41.969
She was willing to look a little foolish
because of her desire for those kids that

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.519
were going to answer the door of their
parents to send their kids to this camp.

00:18:44.929 --> 00:18:46.520
See, that's what I begin to imagine.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.870
When we think about seeking, when
we think about asking, when we think

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:53.610
about knocking, it is something where
you're being loud and proud with it.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.310
You are bold with it, right?

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.380
You're bold with it.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:01.630
And I, I think of it this way as well,
and I want us to look at Luke chapter 18.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.930
If you want to turn there, you can.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.219
It should be up on the screen as well.

00:19:04.229 --> 00:19:11.410
Luke chapter 18 is a great example of a
woman who kept being persistent and loud.

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:13.460
Um, and so let's look at this together.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:18.410
Luke chapter 18, it says, Now he told
them, and this is Jesus speaking.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:24.790
Now he told them a parable on the need
for them to pray always and not give up.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.930
It says, He says there was a judge
in a certain town who didn't fear

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:33.080
God or respect people, and a widow in
that town kept coming to him saying,

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.240
give me justice against my adversary.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:40.239
For a while he was unwilling, but later
he said to himself, even though I don't

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:45.389
fear God or respect people, yet because
the widow keeps pestering me, I will

00:19:45.389 --> 00:19:50.529
give her justice so that she doesn't
wear me out by her persistent coming.

00:19:51.179 --> 00:19:54.860
Then the Lord said, listen to
what the unjust judge says.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:00.129
not God grant justice to his elect
who cry out to him day and night,

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.350
will he delay in helping them?

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.760
I tell you that he will
swiftly grant them justice.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:10.790
Nevertheless, when the son of man
comes, will he find faith on earth?

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.330
Don't miss that last piece.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:17.240
What Jesus is saying to this woman,
what Jesus is telling his disciples

00:20:17.439 --> 00:20:23.149
in this chapter is this idea of being
persistent, being consistent in faith,

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:30.080
trusting and believing that when Roach
God and asking, and in seeking and

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.409
knocking that we believe he will respond.

00:20:33.709 --> 00:20:37.550
Faith is seen sometimes what God sees,
which means sometimes God says the bigger

00:20:37.554 --> 00:20:40.250
picture and that bigger picture is yes.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.430
Sometimes it's no.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.650
Sometimes it's not yet.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.870
Sometimes it's, do you trust me here,
I, I, I, I, I'm telling you, I laugh

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:53.410
about these things in my life, but I
go back to too many times in my life

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.080
where it's like, man, I really feel like
our relationship with Jesus is great.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.960
I just trusted God.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.290
We moved from Oklahoma.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.650
We've seen God do some amazing things
and then something happens in my life

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.970
and it's almost like I, I hear God
saying this to me, do you trust me here?

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.620
It's financially, we're struggling.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.620
Do you trust me here?

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:11.079
My kids are not listening.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:12.810
Do you trust me here?

00:21:13.089 --> 00:21:18.309
I'm having issues in my family, my
family's struggling back in Oklahoma.

00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:19.459
Do you trust me here?

00:21:20.419 --> 00:21:23.299
That's where faith comes from
because God's got the perspective.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:23.910
I don't.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.140
And I'll just tell you this.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.270
This is something.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.510
I hope you cling on today when you're
struggling with God's response to

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:35.860
your asking, seeking and knocking,
have faith in his perspective.

00:21:36.449 --> 00:21:42.000
I'm telling you, I want to have God's
perspective leading my life than mine.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.500
Mine is so narrow minded and
it's also from a broken person.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.189
He's going to speak directly
to that here in just a minute.

00:21:48.689 --> 00:21:52.419
So all these things are so critical
when we think about this, right?

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:53.590
His knocking.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:54.919
He says this, he says, God's response.

00:21:54.919 --> 00:21:55.810
It'll be open to you.

00:21:56.169 --> 00:21:56.990
And I love this picture.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.199
God.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.080
God doesn't refuse to answer
when we consistently knock.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.610
His desire is to hear our requests.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:07.300
And let me just be honest as a parent,
because God is our father and we are his

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.909
children and we've given our lives to him.

00:22:09.449 --> 00:22:11.800
But as a parent, sometimes
my kids annoy me.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:13.530
I love them.

00:22:14.239 --> 00:22:15.510
But you guys know this.

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:21.940
You're driving to Florida and you're 15
minutes in and they say, are we there yet?

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.390
And you're like, no.

00:22:24.869 --> 00:22:26.679
20 minutes later, are we there yet?

00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.580
No.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.290
I'm like, you better shut your mouth, sit
down, and I'll tell you when we're there.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:33.700
Now, I don't say that to my kids.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:38.390
Yeah, but sometimes that
persistent asking annoys me.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.390
But it doesn't annoy our Father in Heaven.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.129
You wanna know why?

00:22:42.679 --> 00:22:43.520
Because He loves us.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.000
He sees our brokenness.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.939
And when we begin to ask,
He desires to hear from us.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.510
And He's not fallible like
me as a parent sometimes.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:53.860
So God is different.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.389
God's eager to hear our
requests and meet our needs.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.250
Right?

00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:00.159
And so He goes on here.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.129
And he begins to kind of compare
now this idea about why he

00:23:03.129 --> 00:23:04.210
wants to give these good gifts.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.419
Why he wants to answer when
we ask, seek, and knock.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.620
And he compares it to the evil
people who give good gifts.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.850
So let's kind of remind
ourselves of these verses.

00:23:13.169 --> 00:23:14.389
He says this in verse 9.

00:23:14.389 --> 00:23:17.729
Who among you, if a son asks him
for bread, will give him a stone?

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.450
Or if he asks him for a
fish, will give him a snake?

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.690
If you then, who are evil, know how to
give good gifts to your children, how

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:29.010
much more will your Father in Heaven
give good gifts to those who seek Him?

00:23:29.869 --> 00:23:30.419
So he's talking...

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.950
We're gonna give good gifts.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.640
If you're not a parent in the
room, it doesn't really matter.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.440
This idea behind, people
know how to give good gifts.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.860
It doesn't matter if you're a
parent or not, you just, you

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:40.610
know how to give good gifts.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.020
You're not gonna be crazy when
you think about this and you look

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.780
at the children who's hungry or
somebody who's hungry, you're not

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.389
gonna give them a stone to chew on.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.059
Anybody gonna give somebody
a stone to chew on?

00:23:50.099 --> 00:23:51.300
Right, that's what I was gonna say.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.149
If somebody raises their hand,
I'm probably gonna smack you.

00:23:53.379 --> 00:23:54.080
That's stupid.

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:57.850
Um, I'm not gonna, I'm really,
somebody's got to tell me to stop

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.159
saying things because this is bad.

00:23:59.179 --> 00:24:00.110
Brittany's not here.

00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:01.059
She's not here to calm you down.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.649
Um, wow, I gotta step back.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.790
Don't tell her, Lauren.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.420
Don't text her.

00:24:10.089 --> 00:24:11.250
Okay, you can send that back.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.740
He also says who here basically
wouldn't give meat, right,

00:24:15.169 --> 00:24:16.220
to their child who needs it?

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.630
Who would put a snake on their plate?

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.379
And here's the thing, there's probably
somebody in this room who would do

00:24:19.379 --> 00:24:20.600
that just to laugh at their kids.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.499
But that's not what
we're talking about here.

00:24:22.809 --> 00:24:25.489
We wouldn't do that because we
genuinely care for our children.

00:24:25.719 --> 00:24:28.439
We genuinely care for others that
we wouldn't give them a stone.

00:24:28.449 --> 00:24:29.289
We wouldn't give them a snake.

00:24:29.289 --> 00:24:31.099
We would give them the things
that they need because...

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:35.360
We're, we're even as evil people good,
and, and let me just kind of address that.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:40.709
Reading sometimes this text and hearing
that God is speaking to us as though we

00:24:40.709 --> 00:24:42.360
are evil people, it's like, how dare you?

00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:43.619
Anybody ever feel that way sometimes?

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:44.689
I'm a good person.

00:24:45.889 --> 00:24:46.389
I'm good.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.690
Well, what God is saying
is none of us are good.

00:24:49.879 --> 00:24:50.960
No, not one.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:55.210
And the Bible even reminds us of this
in Romans 3 10 through 12, it says this,

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.940
there is no one righteous, not even one.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:59.850
There's no one who understands.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:01.500
There's no one who seeks God.

00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:04.780
All have turned away, all
alike have become worthless.

00:25:05.129 --> 00:25:08.860
There is no one who does
what is good, not even one.

00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:14.149
And this is the reason why Jesus came,
to be the righteousness of God for us.

00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:16.550
To be able to provide
what we couldn't provide.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.149
We are good at giving good gifts as
evil people, or sinful people, or

00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:25.139
people who don't, um, have that perfect
relationship with God, but God is

00:25:25.139 --> 00:25:27.409
the one who gives the greatest gifts.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.300
The greatest gifts.

00:25:30.069 --> 00:25:36.610
And so, when we think about this idea of
a I think it's important to understand

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:40.710
that when we ask God something, He's
going to give us a greater gift than

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.170
even we can give our own children.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.610
And maybe even our own friends.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.640
I don't know if you just have
friends or family members.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:50.499
I really want this to resonate with
everybody even if you don't have kids.

00:25:51.019 --> 00:25:52.750
You know how to give good gifts.

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:54.980
Even as a broken person.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.000
But God gives the greater gift.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.890
The greater gift.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:25:59.680
Right?

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.140
So how much more perfect
is this greater gift?

00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:07.190
How I want you to remember this,
is that our greatest gift that

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.030
we can give anyone is Jesus.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:13.090
So the greater gift that Jesus
gives is salvation of our souls,

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.020
forgiveness of our sins, a life that
gives us the fruits of the Spirit,

00:26:17.479 --> 00:26:19.949
that changes and transforms us.

00:26:20.229 --> 00:26:21.839
Jesus gifts are way better.

00:26:22.289 --> 00:26:26.820
So when we're approaching God, and God
doesn't necessarily respond the way

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:32.719
that we hoped He would, our perspective
is, God is so much greater than I need.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.100
And that is hard to hear sometimes.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.980
I just want to be real with you.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.689
It is hard to hear that what
God ends up giving us doesn't

00:26:43.699 --> 00:26:45.790
necessarily seem to benefit us.

00:26:46.169 --> 00:26:50.729
But go back to what is
good in God's perspective?

00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:53.459
He's thinking of the whole kingdom.

00:26:53.879 --> 00:26:55.270
The beginning to the end.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:00.840
His perspective isn't limited and so
He's using every single life and allowing

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.970
things to happen and meeting needs where
needs need to be met in order to bring

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:09.560
glory not only to Him but to bring really
what I would say It is a perspective

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.880
where everybody is looking towards
Christ, not towards all the other things

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.680
in the world that we think we need.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.599
What we need is Jesus.

00:27:20.699 --> 00:27:22.510
And ultimately everything
else flows out of that.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:23.560
Yes, we need food.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.289
We need clothing.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:25.010
We need a house.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.300
We, we need all these other things
that we begin to think that we need,

00:27:28.699 --> 00:27:30.409
but ultimately God knows what's best.

00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:33.379
And he knows that we need a
relationship with him first and then

00:27:33.409 --> 00:27:35.210
all the other things flow under that.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:39.270
And Philippians 419 reminds us of this
when we ask and we seek and we knock, he

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:44.659
says, My God will supply all your needs
according to his riches in Christ Jesus.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:53.530
Jesus desires to fulfill all of our
needs and he will because he is good.

00:27:54.089 --> 00:27:58.060
And so we need to remember as a
child approaches their parents,

00:27:58.469 --> 00:28:01.120
they usually approach their
parents any time of the night.

00:28:01.819 --> 00:28:04.940
I literally was up here during prayer
time getting a phone call from my

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.080
son because my youngest son's sick
at home while my other two kids are

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.310
taking care of him while my wife
and daughter are gone out of state.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.630
And so like, I'm sitting here going,
I'm going to answer this phone, like,

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.730
because I care what my son has to say.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.290
I'm not just going to ignore him because
I hate him because I don't hate him.

00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:22.020
I love him.

00:28:22.599 --> 00:28:26.500
And so God wants us to remember this,
that he, that we can approach him

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:32.089
anytime, night or day, any need that
we have, and he will begin to meet

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.860
our needs and answer our prayers.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.330
But he does say this, that
he will define what is good.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.949
God is not a genie in the bottle.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.510
I've had to remind myself
of this all the time.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.340
Anybody ever play that as a kid?

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.450
If you had three wishes,
what would you wish for?

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:47.600
Anybody?

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.680
That was, I mean, literally me and
my friends, I think it's probably

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.359
because the way we live, we always
talk about what we wish we had.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.079
And when we talk about, you know,
I get a million dollars and I would

00:28:55.079 --> 00:28:57.719
ask for this and I would ask for that
and just always seem to consume us

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.950
because that's what we wish we had.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:00.800
But God is not a genie in a bottle.

00:29:00.809 --> 00:29:04.400
We don't rub a lamp to get what
we want, those three wishes.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:08.310
No, we pursue after God and
we trust his perspective.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.740
And so God's perspective
isn't limited, right?

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.000
Ours is, and knowing that.

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:14.840
How we do this.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.790
And I want to kind of remind us of another
scenario with this, any, any parents in

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:23.310
this room ever, uh, told their kids to
do something that they didn't want to do.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.079
And here's the thing.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.670
Anybody had a parent tell you something
that you didn't want to do when you

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:35.159
were growing up many times, and because
we're foul people, sometimes we make

00:29:35.159 --> 00:29:39.230
wrong mistakes, but many times we're
making those decisions off of the

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.850
perspective that our kids don't have.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.740
They've lived a life.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.700
We've lived a life that
our kids haven't lived.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.259
And so we protect them and we
don't allow them to go this place.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.770
We don't allow them to have
that app, or that phone, or

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.510
that friend, or you name it.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.580
And it's hard at that time,
because they don't understand it.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.290
They're so mad.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.900
Why aren't you giving me what I want?

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.909
And as parents, it's tough to say.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:00.320
No.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.530
But because we know what's
better for our kids, we say no.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:09.250
That is God speaking to us as adults,
and here's the thing as adults, we're

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.980
like, we should get whatever we want,
and God should listen to me, and God's

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:17.560
like, no, because I have your best
interest at mind, and at heart, and maybe

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.400
that doesn't help you, but it helps me.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:25.220
If I believe the best in God,
then when God responds differently

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:28.680
than what I desire, I accept it.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.440
Not because it's easy.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.850
But because it's best.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:40.280
And to me, knowing things that I
protect my kids from, and knowing

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:44.550
what's best for them, and what I've
seen them saved from, in regards to

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:48.650
that, helps me know that my Heavenly
Father is doing the same thing for me.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.430
And He's doing the same thing for you.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.830
But it's hard.

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:54.140
It's hard.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.409
So God says that He gives
us good gifts, right?

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:01.520
He gives us good gifts, and
He gives us these good things.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.620
And he says this at the back
end of, uh, verse 11 here.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.570
Um, and James 1, 17 even
affirms, affirms this.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:11.250
He says, Every good and perfect
gift is from above, coming down

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.810
from the Father of lights, who does
not change like shifting shadows.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.949
So God is good and he
gives us these good things.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:25.030
And so when we understand the goodness
of his gift, we can trust him, right?

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.630
We can trust him with the right
perspective, with faith, knowing that

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:31.999
God is the one that is doing something.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:32.680
greater.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:37.030
Maybe even in the hard times of
asking and not receiving what we want.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.280
So this last verse, and I'll just
kind of tell you a little bit of

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.679
the same thing as we did last week.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.700
Last week, verse six kind of seemed
as a little bit of an outlier.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.439
Verse 12 is a good verse.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.200
It's actually known as the golden rule.

00:31:50.129 --> 00:31:52.560
And it's a good verse in the fact that
there's somehow this doesn't seem to just

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.030
necessarily line up completely with this,
but there's a greater picture to this.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.500
And this is the picture that we see.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:01.990
Receiving good gifts from God reminds
us to give good gifts to others.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.080
Many times in our asking and our
seeking and our knocking, we're so

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.650
very narrow-minded in our asking,
seeking and knocking that we forget

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:10.850
that it's all about God's kingdom.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:12.740
And so he says this in verse 12.

00:32:12.745 --> 00:32:16.550
Therefore, therefore, meaning take
everything that just got spoke about

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:22.010
into account, he says, whatever you want
others to do for you, do also for them.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.960
For this is the law and the prophets.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.680
Prophets.

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:28.220
So this idea that the God is saying
when we're seeking, when we're

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:32.360
asking, when we are knocking, we
are knocking and asking and seeking.

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:34.210
For the benefit of others too.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.500
Because Many of us are
selfish and anybody's selfish.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.800
I mean you you want what you want Uh,
and god is teaching us not to do that

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.670
But at times that just overcomes us
we we truthfully want what we want and

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.890
many times that are asking seeking and
knocking If my pastor used to tell me

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:55.290
this If god granted every single one of
your prayers that you prayed over the last

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:57.910
month, how many people would be affected?

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:04.920
It's convicting Because I can tell you
one to two Some of you are spiritual So

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:10.690
you probably have 15 or 20 praise God,
keep doing it and teach us, keep doing it.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.640
But many of us would have one or two.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:15.500
I believe this is exactly
what he's saying here.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:21.730
If you are wanting God to respond to
your prayers, praying for others and

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:24.349
helping meet some of their needs,
you may be, and I've mentioned this

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:29.470
before as a church, you may be the
answer to someone else's prayer.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:35.420
Maybe you need to hear that today
is when you see the needs of others

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:38.000
and maybe they've been praying,
but you don't know it and you.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.500
You may be the answer to their prayers.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.250
You're part of God's plan to
answer because He says He will.

00:33:46.439 --> 00:33:47.700
I think that's a beautiful picture.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.420
I think that's what gets me up in the
morning and going because I know there's

00:33:52.439 --> 00:34:00.400
people that are waiting on me to seek God,
to ask God, and to knock, no matter what,

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:06.130
boldly to be able to see people come to
know Jesus, to be able to see God's hand

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:07.590
in their life and working in their life.

00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:09.419
So Jesus modeled that.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:13.060
He said he came to
serve, not to be served.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.860
And for each one of us, we
need to be reminded of that.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:18.629
We need to be reminded of that.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.260
And I have no clue where my last page is.

00:34:20.599 --> 00:34:21.120
There it is.

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.510
So let's just think
about how we end today.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:27.890
I want to kind of pull this
all back together because I

00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:28.799
talked about a lot of things.

00:34:28.799 --> 00:34:32.940
But, just thinking about this verse
and asking, seeking, and knocking.

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:37.010
Anybody ever struggle with approaching
God with a deep, deep prayer because

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:38.050
you're afraid it's not going to answer?

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:38.630
Anybody?

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:40.200
You're afraid it's not going to answer?

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:41.840
Or you're afraid he's going to answer?

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.940
I think there's many of us in this
room that's probably struggled to pray

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:49.880
or we've not got a prayer answered
the way that we desire, right?

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:53.580
And I believe that God is
reminding us in here that it's

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:55.140
not a lack of God answering.

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.679
It's not a lack of God answering.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.659
Because I believe God's Word is truth.

00:34:59.899 --> 00:35:03.010
I'm telling you as a pastor, as a
believer, I think we have to come to

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:04.430
the conclusion that God's Word is truth.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:07.020
John 17, 17 said His Word is truth.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:09.810
I've seen His Word work
in and through my life.

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:13.099
I can't just pick verses that
apply to me and don't apply to me.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.260
I have to read this as truth.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.930
He says he will answer.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.640
He will give.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:23.280
So I have to say, okay,
what's my part in it?

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:28.929
It's actually whenever I'm asking and
whenever I'm seeking and whenever I'm

00:35:28.929 --> 00:35:36.040
knocking, saying Lord, help me accept
whatever your answer is, because I

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.460
think it's the accepting part guys.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.710
I truly believe it's not the asking.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.770
I believe it's the accepting the answer
because sometimes God's going to say

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:45.000
no, he's going to say no, because it's.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.460
It's not beneficial for you.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:47.830
That's why he gives good gifts.

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.530
Do you think God would give you a
bad gift because you asked for it?

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.560
No.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:53.410
Because he's a good God.

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:57.540
So when you ask for something that's not
of value for you, you're not gonna get it.

00:35:57.850 --> 00:35:58.570
And it's a no.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:35:59.560
It's a hard no.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.640
And you'd be like, but I want that.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.850
You know how many times my kids ask for
sweets at like 11pm and I'm like, no.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:08.920
And they don't know why.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:10.260
And it's because I want them.

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:15.360
But that's not, I mean, Sorry,
I'm not throwing that off there.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:15.400
Okay.

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.890
God knows what's best for us.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:22.460
And so I would say this, that
it's not in the asking, it's in

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.799
the receiving from God and truly
accepting what he gives us, right?

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:27.959
Truly believing that God's word is good.

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:32.160
So I want you to think through this
with me and it's just kind of just as

00:36:32.179 --> 00:36:37.870
I begin to think through some reasons
of why we struggle with praying and

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.980
asking and some things that maybe we
can walk through during the invitation.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.659
These are some things that
just came to mind to me.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.540
Here's some conclusions.

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.000
Number one, I think it's
more about us not liking.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:50.700
Him what he, his response is not
God responding, if that makes sense.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:55.260
It's more us not liking what God responds
to us and our asking than it is about

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.330
us just not getting the answer from God.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:02.320
Number one, I think it's us not
seeking, let me define this,

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.870
pursuing God's word, pursuing Jesus.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.030
I, I, I'm guilty of this.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:13.780
I'll ask, and I mean genuine faith,
I feel like on Monday and I walk away

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.260
and, and I don't, I don't perceive Jesus
anymore and I, I'm not seeking his word.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:21.190
I'm not just asking for wisdom from God.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.620
I just, I ask and just move on.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:28.209
And I think sometimes it's in the
seeking where we find the jewels, where

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:32.040
we see God show up, where we see in
the word, where God affirms something.

00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:35.540
And I think about the critical times
in my life where I truly sought God.

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:39.960
God's word was the thing that gave
me the peace of the affirming answer.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:43.080
So I think sometimes
it's us just not seeking.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.670
And number three, this is the last one.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:48.200
I think it's us talking about.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.000
But never knocking.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.670
Let me give you a great example.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.730
Anybody ever call a friend?

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.409
I've heard about everything that
you don't have, and God's not

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.050
moving, and you wished you had.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:37:59.619
You ever had that?

00:38:02.039 --> 00:38:03.220
And then you just go on with life.

00:38:04.369 --> 00:38:05.150
God's sitting there.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.109
He's seeing you call your friend.

00:38:07.179 --> 00:38:10.100
He's seeing you tell your
friend all the needs.

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.170
But you never knocked.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.040
He never asked.

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:15.990
And He's saying, I'm waiting.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.060
He said, this is the cool
part with the seeking.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.820
It's there.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:23.240
But we refuse to knock.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.670
And be active in truly seeking the Lord.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.480
So, that's how we're going
to kind of lead Invitation.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.110
I want to take time to walk you through.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:32.419
I love this about Invitation.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:35.580
Until God changes my heart, I
want to make sure I'm continually

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.309
leading you through Invitation.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.490
Than to just say, Hey, we're
going to pray during this time.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:40.740
And you're just like,
What do I pray about?

00:38:41.249 --> 00:38:42.769
I really want to lead you through this.

00:38:42.779 --> 00:38:46.979
And I really want that to drive you into
how God transforms your heart this week.

00:38:47.139 --> 00:38:47.779
Does that sound good?

00:38:48.739 --> 00:38:50.040
Alright, let's just
start off with a prayer.

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:51.780
Lord Jesus, we just
thank you so much, Lord.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:52.510
We thank you for your word.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.790
We thank you for your truth.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.560
We thank you that you say that
it's day we ask and we seek and

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.080
we not look that you will respond.

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:01.230
But Lord, I'm praying that you
begin to soften our hearts right

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:06.139
now to learn what we hear from
you and how you respond to us.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.510
So what I want to start with today is as
we continue to pray, this is the first

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.569
thing that I want you to just pray.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:12.450
Wherever you are.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:17.020
I want you to just pray and
ask God to forgive you for not

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.200
accepting his response in the past.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.640
I just want you to ask God this
and say, Lord, forgive me for

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:23.720
not accepting your response

00:39:47.359 --> 00:39:52.340
I want you to now just ask him
to help you see his response

00:39:52.459 --> 00:39:54.630
when you ask him in the future.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:57.390
Help him to give you the
perspective that he has

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:16.580
right now.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.460
This is what I want you to do.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.700
I want you to pray and
ask God to help you truly.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:25.320
To truly seek Him, not just sit
on the sidelines and ask, but to

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.300
seek His Word, to seek prayer,
and to daily walk with Jesus.

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:30.560
So just ask God to help
you truly seek Him.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.740
Okay, the

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:59.489
last thing I want you to do is I
want you to begin to, use a big

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.329
word here, repent or turn from.

00:41:02.759 --> 00:41:08.030
And ask God to help you stop telling other
people your problems and not telling God.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:10.959
And I'm not saying don't tell
other people your problems,

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.960
but I'm saying make sure that.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:20.070
So, just ask God to help you and remind
you to knock and tell Him your problems.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.750
So begin to ask God that now to help you.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:45.690
Alright, as we get ready to move into
a time of worship, there's a couple

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.540
things I really want to challenge
you, those sitting in the seats here.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.460
This idea behind seeking, asking.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.260
You know, it starts with the relationship
because I'll just tell you this, if

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:00.640
you walked up to a random person today
and begin to ask some of the things

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:04.080
that we ask God and begin to seek
that person and to knock on their

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.500
life, they're going to not talk to you
because you're a weird, awkward person.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.410
But I'll tell you this, if you build a
relationship with that person, if you

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:15.580
invite them into a relationship, if
they accept you into a relationship,

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.890
that's a different perspective.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:20.129
You can ask and you can
knock and you can seek.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.460
So God.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.250
If God is saying that same thing
to you today, it's hard to ask a

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:25.740
God that you've never accepted.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.790
It's hard to seek a God you've
never sought after before.

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:32.150
It's hard to ever knock on His door
because you don't know where He is.

00:42:32.159 --> 00:42:35.540
So if you've never given your life
to Jesus, if you've never accepted

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:39.090
Christ and turned your life over
to Him, today you can do that.

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.780
Today you can repent of your sins,
turn to God and say, I need you.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:44.070
I need you.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:48.740
It's simple in the fact that God has done
all the work and it's up to us to accept

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.590
what He's done on the cross for our sins.

00:42:50.819 --> 00:42:51.540
So I challenge you.

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.990
So that it starts with saying
yes, Jesus, I need you.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:59.140
It starts with repenting of
your sins and accepting God.

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:01.510
And that's your beginning ask of God.

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:04.970
And here's what God
promises, He will save you.

00:43:05.199 --> 00:43:08.439
He will forgive you of your sins
and He will transform your life.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.139
How do I know that?

00:43:10.249 --> 00:43:11.280
Because He's transformed mine.

00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:14.000
And He's transformed so many
people's lives that I've seen that

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.310
have truly served the life to them.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.010
So I just, I challenge you today, if
you've never given your life to Jesus,

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.450
that you do that right where you are.

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:22.200
That you ask God to come into your life.

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.140
And if you have any questions during
this time of worship that we're getting

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.580
ready to have, I'm gonna be in the back.

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:29.140
I'd love to talk to you about
how you give your lives to Jesus.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.690
That's where I want you to go
if you have those questions.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:37.600
But as we continue to worship, don't just
stand there half heartedly worshiping.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:42.620
I want you to begin to grasp God
and use this newfound challenge

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.700
to ask and to seek and to not.

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:49.840
And this is what Philippians says,
Don't worry about anything but in

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.160
everything through prayer and petition.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:58.340
With Thanksgiving present your request to
God and the peace of God, which surpasses

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:02.150
all understanding will guard your
hearts and mind increase Jesus Christ.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.370
So my challenge to you during
worship is to begin to accept the

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:07.990
good gifts that God has for you.

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:13.740
Begin to ask and seek God today, and
then leave this time of worship and

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:17.280
begin to experience it this whole
week and the rest of your life.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:22.260
Because God says to come to me, all
who are weird Ed and I will give you.

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.250
So Lord Jesus, we pray
that you just change lives.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:27.640
You continue changing lives, Lord.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.220
I pray if there's a person in this
room that doesn't know you, I pray

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.730
that they come to faith in you, Lord.

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:34.130
I pray that they come back and talk
to me, Lord, if they have questions.

00:44:34.659 --> 00:44:38.020
Lord, I believe that your word
doesn't return void, so Lord, I'm

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:41.560
praying that there's something that
every person can take home today.

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.160
That they can even take
the word faith home.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.500
That faith is seeing what you see,
Lord, even though we don't see it.

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:52.739
That they begin to ask and to receive
and to experience something new.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.690
God, show up.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:59.210
And Lord, we'll celebrate because we
know that you are a God that pursues us.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:00.440
You're a God that cares for us.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.900
And you're a God that loves us.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.440
So Lord, be with us as we
take some time to worship.

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:08.710
So we pray this in your heavenly name.

00:45:09.299 --> 00:45:09.619
Amen.
