00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.710
Alright, let's, uh, go ahead
and jump in and get ready, uh,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.190
to hear from the Word today.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.020
Um, I don't know about you, but, um,
each and every week that we get to

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.969
jump into the Word, I'm always excited.

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:20.250
And there's a reason why I'm excited,
and it's because I've spent a whole

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.180
week hearing what you're gonna hear.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.860
And like, one, going through the,
the, what we call the process of,

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.130
like, our thinking, where we hear
it, and we don't want to hear it.

00:00:33.775 --> 00:00:36.585
And then we hear it, and
then we go, I need this.

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:37.355
I need to hear it.

00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:40.495
And then we hear it, and then we
accept it, and then we hear it,

00:00:40.894 --> 00:00:42.015
and then we go, this is good.

00:00:42.824 --> 00:00:45.284
See, that happens in my week, but then
I get to come, and I'll be like, hey,

00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:49.124
I'm presenting a message that God has
given, where you're gonna hear it.

00:00:49.144 --> 00:00:52.085
And I know for some of you, I'm praying
through this message, you're gonna hear

00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:54.585
it, and you're gonna go, oh, this hurts.

00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:56.555
And you're gonna hear it, and
you're gonna go, oh, I need this.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.730
And you're going to hear it, and
you're going to go, I'm accepting this.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.240
And you're going to leave out of here,
and you're going to begin to live it.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.740
That, that's my prayer every week.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.349
That's my desire every week.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.789
And so I'm hoping today that you
will get that from this message.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.820
Um, and so today we're going to
be finishing up our mini series

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.229
in the book of Matthew chapter 7.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.940
We've been in just chapter
7, uh, in this mini series.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.230
And so the last part of it
is verses 24 through 29.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.650
So that's where we're going to be if
you want to turn that, uh, into your

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.359
Bibles you can, or on your phones, or
it'll be behind us here in a minute.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.700
But it's the last part of
Jesus's Sermon on the Mount.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.050
Um, and we begin to look at how Jesus
has been teaching all of his disciples

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.930
and those who came to hear the sermon
about how to live in the Kingdom of God.

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:44.379
How to live in the Kingdom of God, how to
follow after God and, you know, things in

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:46.699
which we are to prioritize and, and to...

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.209
It kind of ends up being a little bit...

00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:52.105
It's to live, right?

00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:58.375
And so today, Jesus final statement is
really this statement, that the storms in

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:01.855
our life will reveal our true foundation.

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:05.824
The storms in our life will
reveal our true foundation.

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:08.365
Um, and, and I think it's
going to be a convicting one

00:02:08.365 --> 00:02:09.384
because it was convicting to me.

00:02:09.705 --> 00:02:13.924
Um, and, uh, I know that
it was beneficial for me.

00:02:13.924 --> 00:02:15.095
So here, here, let me ask this question.

00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:16.645
Who here has ever built?

00:02:16.984 --> 00:02:17.505
A home.

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:18.815
Anybody here built a home?

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:20.484
Okay, we got like one person.

00:02:20.484 --> 00:02:20.845
Great.

00:02:21.255 --> 00:02:24.894
Anybody here ever had a home
that had a poor foundation?

00:02:26.385 --> 00:02:28.725
Wow, so you guys are, I
get to teach you today.

00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:32.515
Okay, so there's some signs
to a poor foundation in a

00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:33.704
home that's called cracking.

00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:35.204
And maybe some of you
are going to go, crap.

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:38.804
I have a poor foundation and this message
is going to help you go get some help

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:41.255
within your house, literally your house.

00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:45.924
Um, but when we look at our
walls, we see cracking, we begin

00:02:45.924 --> 00:02:47.124
to see cracking on our ceiling.

00:02:47.124 --> 00:02:51.184
And what we begin to think with that is
we think, we don't think poor foundation.

00:02:51.184 --> 00:02:54.015
We think, I need to mud
and tape and paint this.

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:57.445
And so if you're anything like me,
we don't ever do it because we,

00:02:57.445 --> 00:03:00.144
it's one of those to do lists that
are never on the list that I do.

00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:04.114
Um, but we don't ever think
anything about it, but maybe you do.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.040
You kind of patch it and paint it and you
don't see anything for a while and all of

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.820
a sudden there's more cracks and there's
more cracks and there's more cracks.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.380
And when you begin to have an
expert come out, you realize that

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.739
there is a poor foundation under
your home, right under your home.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.629
And so because of that, we can't just
keep ignoring the poor foundation.

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:24.560
We have to address it.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.760
So now let's move that
into our practical lives.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.700
There's cracks in our home.

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.780
There's cracks in our personal life.

00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:36.835
In our family life, and for those of
us in our ministry life as well, and

00:03:36.835 --> 00:03:38.825
how we live out our faith in Christ.

00:03:39.105 --> 00:03:41.745
And that could be cracks just in
our marriage, uh, that could be

00:03:41.745 --> 00:03:46.045
cracks in just our, uh, our job,
um, and friendships in society.

00:03:46.505 --> 00:03:50.354
And those cracks are there
to show you something.

00:03:51.134 --> 00:03:53.894
It's to show you that you
may have a poor foundation.

00:03:54.374 --> 00:03:57.965
And, and here is my hope and
prayer, is that either today...

00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:02.105
You won't see cracks in your life
because you have a firm foundation.

00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:06.715
Or maybe you'll realize that the cracks
that are in your life are a sign that

00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:09.195
your foundation is not in Christ.

00:04:09.575 --> 00:04:10.605
And that you need that.

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:13.995
That there's a hope in Jesus to help you.

00:04:14.244 --> 00:04:14.574
Right?

00:04:15.064 --> 00:04:17.295
And so, again, I want
you to ask this question.

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:21.935
What are, uh, what in the foundation
of my life needs to be fixed so

00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:23.795
that I don't keep doing patchwork?

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.320
On the cracks in my life.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.380
So let's read this text
and dive deep into it.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.840
So here it is again, Matthew
chapter seven, starting in verse 24.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.909
It says, therefore, everyone who
hears these words of mine and acts

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.950
on them will be like a wise man
who built his house on the rock.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.170
The rain fell, the rivers rose,
and the winds blew and pounded that

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.200
house, yet it didn't collapse because
its foundation was on the rock.

00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:55.985
But everyone who hears these
words of mine and doesn't act on

00:04:55.985 --> 00:04:59.555
them will be like a foolish man
who built his house on the sand.

00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:04.015
The rain fell, and the rivers rose,
and the winds blew and pounded

00:05:04.015 --> 00:05:05.945
that house, and it collapsed.

00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:08.074
And it collapsed with a great...

00:05:08.435 --> 00:05:09.125
Crash.

00:05:09.555 --> 00:05:12.365
And when Jesus had finished saying
these things, the crowds were

00:05:12.365 --> 00:05:16.355
astonished at his teaching because
he was teaching to them like one who

00:05:16.355 --> 00:05:18.855
had authority, not like the scribes.

00:05:19.074 --> 00:05:19.595
So let's pray.

00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:23.535
Lord Jesus, we ask, Lord, that you
take this word and that you pour it

00:05:23.545 --> 00:05:26.665
deep into our hearts, Lord, that it
doesn't just sit there in our hearts,

00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:30.735
Lord, but it begins to transform our
lives and that we leave here changed

00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:32.545
for our good and for your glory.

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:33.705
We pray this in your heavenly name.

00:05:34.145 --> 00:05:34.505
Amen.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.800
So, when we look at this story, what
we begin to see is a picture of two

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.590
different men or two different people.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.380
Uh, because he uses these words, anyone
who hears these words, and then he begins

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.499
to describe two men, one that built a
home that was poor and one that didn't.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.760
Right.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.220
And so we're going to kind of look at this
story back and forth at these two men.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.090
So two different men are two different
people, two different outcomes.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.730
But the thing that we're going to focus
on the first is what they had in common.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.580
What they had in common.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.280
And so the things that we see here
is we look at what they had in

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.590
common is, uh, they had in common
that they were building a home.

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.780
They were building a home.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.470
They had a goal.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.480
They had a dream that they want to
build this beautiful, amazing home.

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:23.155
And when we begin to look at just in
the Bible and we begin to think of like

00:06:23.155 --> 00:06:26.395
a house, there's a couple of different
things that you're going to hear in

00:06:26.395 --> 00:06:28.005
the Bible that's referred to a house.

00:06:28.015 --> 00:06:30.365
Typically it's going to
be like your self, right?

00:06:30.405 --> 00:06:31.754
Your temple, your house.

00:06:32.045 --> 00:06:36.384
So personally, you're going to
hear the home, the house, and then

00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:40.595
typically you'll even hear things
like the ministry or culture, um,

00:06:40.605 --> 00:06:43.065
the, the society of building a house.

00:06:43.265 --> 00:06:45.805
And so today we're just going to kind
of focus on, on the personal, the, the

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:49.005
home, and then also within our ministry.

00:06:49.415 --> 00:06:52.705
And so the first thing that we see here is
when we're talking about building a house,

00:06:52.915 --> 00:06:54.005
we're talking about building a life.

00:06:54.005 --> 00:06:56.515
And so these two men may not be talking
about a physical house, but really could

00:06:56.525 --> 00:06:58.955
be talking about their personal lives.

00:06:59.255 --> 00:07:02.055
So personally, they want
to achieve something.

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:03.935
They want to achieve success.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:07.235
Maybe they want to, if we're thinking
spiritually here, they want to succeed or

00:07:07.235 --> 00:07:10.095
achieve a great relationship with Christ.

00:07:10.464 --> 00:07:12.944
If it comes to a family, maybe
these two men were wanting to build

00:07:12.945 --> 00:07:15.405
a home, uh, in their home, right?

00:07:15.405 --> 00:07:18.165
They wanted to build a successful
family, one that was fruitful, one

00:07:18.165 --> 00:07:21.125
that had kids that actually loved
them and loved to come back when they

00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:22.755
had kids and hang around their house.

00:07:23.095 --> 00:07:25.255
Maybe it was a ministry that
they were talking about.

00:07:25.485 --> 00:07:28.335
That they wanted to build a
successful ministry or a church.

00:07:28.545 --> 00:07:30.895
They wanted to invest in people and
they wanted to expand God's kingdom.

00:07:30.915 --> 00:07:34.744
So they both started with
the desire to build a house.

00:07:35.335 --> 00:07:39.365
So at the beginning of this journey, my
guess, as I begin to dive into this, is

00:07:39.495 --> 00:07:41.084
that they both wanted to be successful.

00:07:41.515 --> 00:07:44.865
I mean, does anybody in here
ever start a project that they

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:45.905
want to be unsuccessful at?

00:07:45.925 --> 00:07:46.375
Anybody?

00:07:48.465 --> 00:07:48.925
Noah.

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:50.295
I knew there was going to be somebody.

00:07:50.295 --> 00:07:51.805
There's always that one person, right?

00:07:52.195 --> 00:07:54.435
Um, but most of us don't do that.

00:07:54.445 --> 00:07:56.304
We, we want to be successful.

00:07:56.305 --> 00:07:59.925
So I'm really wanting us to just dive
into the heart of this story and the fact

00:07:59.925 --> 00:08:03.454
that these guys had great intentions.

00:08:03.735 --> 00:08:05.134
They wanted to be successful.

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:07.335
So again, when you're thinking about
personally, they didn't want...

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.340
To fail personally.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.340
They didn't want to fail in their personal
life and their personal walk with Jesus.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.320
They wanted to be successful.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.360
They didn't want to fail in their
family and have divorce and brokenness.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:17.539
They wanted to be successful.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.990
They didn't want to
fail in their ministry.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.370
They wanted to have successful ministry,
but, Really, when you look at it, they,

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:25.059
They may end up having a poor ministry.

00:08:25.329 --> 00:08:26.470
Because of their foundation.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.880
So, they started at that same place.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.610
The next thing you see here
and I love this part, They

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.110
both heard the message, right?

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.005
It says, Everyone who hears these
words, And acts on them is a wise

00:08:36.005 --> 00:08:40.455
man, and everyone who hears these
words and doesn't act them is a fool.

00:08:41.305 --> 00:08:44.105
So, two men heard the same message.

00:08:44.745 --> 00:08:45.865
The same message.

00:08:46.104 --> 00:08:47.325
Sat in the same church.

00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:48.985
Heard the same message.

00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:49.745
Right?

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:51.494
They sat under good
preaching and teaching.

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:52.305
Right?

00:08:52.305 --> 00:08:53.594
They heard the message.

00:08:54.564 --> 00:08:58.014
But two different men
responded two different ways.

00:08:58.144 --> 00:08:58.254
Right?

00:08:58.385 --> 00:08:59.615
And I want you to think about this.

00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:00.915
This word, therefore.

00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:02.735
We usually talk about
this word, therefore.

00:09:02.735 --> 00:09:03.995
When you see the word, therefore, it's...

00:09:04.505 --> 00:09:05.395
What is it there for?

00:09:05.395 --> 00:09:07.795
It's talking about everything
that Jesus got done talking

00:09:07.795 --> 00:09:08.744
about in the Sermon on the Mount.

00:09:09.485 --> 00:09:09.735
Right?

00:09:09.735 --> 00:09:13.035
So when he kind of summarizes this
sermon, Jesus is saying, everything that

00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:18.534
I've shared, therefore, anyone who hears
these words and acts on them is wise.

00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:20.595
So what was the therefore?

00:09:20.835 --> 00:09:24.465
So both of these men sat under
the truth of God's word, right?

00:09:24.485 --> 00:09:25.924
Some of the things I just
want to highlight them.

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:28.775
Here's some things that Jesus
taught some of his followers

00:09:28.775 --> 00:09:29.655
during the sermon on the mountain.

00:09:29.655 --> 00:09:33.075
Number one, don't worry, but
seek first the kingdom of God.

00:09:33.515 --> 00:09:36.485
Don't judge before you take.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.910
Basically, the log out of your eye
before you begin to help other people.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.870
He says to ask and to seek and
to knock when you need something,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.210
because God will respond.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.790
He responded, he communicated to them
that the narrow road leads to life and

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.990
the wide road leads to destruction.

00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:56.499
He challenged them to guard
themselves against false teaching.

00:09:56.499 --> 00:10:00.560
So all of these things, the therefore
these men would have heard, right?

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:01.230
Think about this.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.520
These men are sitting here.

00:10:02.965 --> 00:10:04.215
And they're hearing these things.

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:06.405
They sat under the same truth.

00:10:06.435 --> 00:10:07.905
Both of them sat under the same truth.

00:10:07.925 --> 00:10:10.605
So they had the goal to
build a successful home.

00:10:10.605 --> 00:10:12.275
Again, maybe it wasn't an actual home.

00:10:12.285 --> 00:10:14.604
Maybe it was their personal life,
their family life, their ministry.

00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:17.695
They had sat under the same teaching.

00:10:18.065 --> 00:10:21.395
Maybe they sat next to each
other and heard the same truths.

00:10:22.535 --> 00:10:25.735
The last thing that we see that
they had in common was the storm.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.510
They both went through
the same storm, right?

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.040
And, and I've heard this statement
before is that everyone is either going

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.970
into a storm, they're in the midst of a
storm, and coming out of one maybe, or

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.530
they're getting ready to go into one.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.679
So, one of the things I begin to
think about here is none of us are

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.159
absent from the storms of life.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:44.930
None of us.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.039
It doesn't matter if
you're good or you're bad.

00:10:47.199 --> 00:10:49.999
It doesn't matter if you're evil
or, you know, you're perfect.

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:52.849
It doesn't matter who you are, what
you look like, how old you are.

00:10:53.059 --> 00:10:54.149
You will.

00:10:54.495 --> 00:10:57.605
Have storms and both of
these men had that in common.

00:10:57.915 --> 00:11:02.665
So because we understand the things
they had in common, we could easily

00:11:02.665 --> 00:11:04.514
see that both of them felt like that.

00:11:04.514 --> 00:11:08.685
They were heading into a
successful building project, right?

00:11:08.685 --> 00:11:11.505
Successful building project, but
there was something different.

00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:13.075
And that's the thing I want
us to look at now, right?

00:11:13.075 --> 00:11:17.025
There's something different, you know,
one of them made a wise choice and

00:11:17.025 --> 00:11:18.625
one of them made a foolish choice.

00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:19.945
And I really want to talk about this.

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:22.855
He talks about the wise
person and the foolish person.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.490
So we have to kind of define what is
a wise person and a foolish person.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:31.830
So, when we look at what a wise
person is, a wise person applies

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.019
spiritual truth to life's decisions.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.670
A wise person applies spiritual
truth to life's decision.

00:11:41.979 --> 00:11:47.660
An unwise person, or a foolish person,
has the inability or refuses to apply

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.520
spiritual truth to life's decisions.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.360
They refuse to.

00:11:52.395 --> 00:11:53.255
Simple as that.

00:11:53.405 --> 00:11:56.675
One applies spiritual truth
to their life, one doesn't.

00:11:57.275 --> 00:11:59.875
And so that's why it's important for
us to even remember, as we kind of

00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:03.805
stop and reflect on this, that it's
not the truths you know that matter.

00:12:04.075 --> 00:12:08.355
It's not the knowledge you have
that matters, but the truth and

00:12:08.355 --> 00:12:10.574
the knowledge in which you act on.

00:12:11.384 --> 00:12:12.054
You obey.

00:12:12.114 --> 00:12:13.034
You follow.

00:12:13.144 --> 00:12:15.185
Those are the only ones that
will ever make a decision, or

00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:16.505
make an impact on your life.

00:12:16.775 --> 00:12:18.165
The only ones.

00:12:18.815 --> 00:12:22.615
And so in particular in this
situation, the foundation was the

00:12:22.615 --> 00:12:24.785
biggest mistake that one of them made.

00:12:25.235 --> 00:12:29.575
They had the ability to look at their
lives and start with the right foundation.

00:12:30.025 --> 00:12:32.815
It may sound like one
small thing, but it's not.

00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:36.414
And just to kind of even give you some
examples, so, we are in a community that

00:12:36.424 --> 00:12:38.174
has been building homes all around us.

00:12:38.175 --> 00:12:41.125
So we had our house built, and there's
houses being built all around us.

00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:42.285
And here's one of the things that I know.

00:12:43.075 --> 00:12:44.805
Their foundation is made up of concrete.

00:12:44.815 --> 00:12:46.845
They literally go in
and they pour concrete.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.430
But one of the things that I noticed
is that they kind of, once they pour

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.060
this concrete, they kind of put all
these little things around it so

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.080
that nobody touches the concrete.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.390
And here's the thing, they don't go
back and build on it the next day.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.340
They wait days.

00:13:01.449 --> 00:13:02.390
Does anybody know why?

00:13:03.919 --> 00:13:04.620
Let it cure.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.920
Because if they were to build on
it too early, what may happen?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.920
It may crumble.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.620
And so they put these barriers up because
they want to make sure that they are going

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.350
to build on a solid and a firm foundation.

00:13:17.035 --> 00:13:22.735
One of these men was patient, the
other one was not patient, right?

00:13:23.265 --> 00:13:25.765
And so when we think about this
foundation, right, within our

00:13:25.765 --> 00:13:28.025
lives, what does that look like?

00:13:28.425 --> 00:13:31.025
And so they had in common, again,
that they were building, even what

00:13:31.025 --> 00:13:35.794
we say is the same thing, the same
house, the same personal life, the

00:13:35.794 --> 00:13:36.954
same ministry, the same family.

00:13:36.954 --> 00:13:40.154
They're building the same thing, but
they both didn't start at the same place.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.660
So let's look at where
one of them started.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:42.960
Right.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.900
He talks about the wise man here
who built his house on the rock.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.650
So the wise man chose a
different place to build.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.009
And when you think about
the rock, it is difficult to

00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:56.790
build your foundation on rock.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.270
Why?

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.179
Because there's a lot more work involved.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.220
There's a lot more cost involved.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.890
It'd be slower to be able
to build on that rock.

00:14:05.645 --> 00:14:08.985
I, I, I'm a kind of a history guy and
I love listening to history podcasts

00:14:08.985 --> 00:14:12.505
and I listen to, uh, this history, uh,
podcast where they were talking about

00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:16.015
the railroad whenever they were, uh,
was a transcontinental railroad, right?

00:14:16.015 --> 00:14:18.894
And I love history and there comes
a point where they come to these

00:14:18.914 --> 00:14:21.305
mountains that they can't go over.

00:14:21.305 --> 00:14:22.615
So they go through them.

00:14:23.115 --> 00:14:26.425
And I remember listening to how they
went through them and they would

00:14:26.425 --> 00:14:31.925
call it success if they got through
10 to 15 feet of rock a day success.

00:14:32.525 --> 00:14:34.435
It was not a fast pace.

00:14:34.735 --> 00:14:36.765
Now if they were out on flat
ground and there was nothing

00:14:36.765 --> 00:14:38.025
going on, they could just fly.

00:14:38.055 --> 00:14:40.165
But when it came to those mountains,
they had to go through them.

00:14:40.384 --> 00:14:42.274
And it took so much time and effort.

00:14:42.765 --> 00:14:45.194
So one guy chose to do the hard work.

00:14:46.015 --> 00:14:47.785
One guy chose to build on sand.

00:14:47.834 --> 00:14:48.914
Anybody ever built a sandcastle?

00:14:48.925 --> 00:14:52.289
Although they typically fall, which kind
of hints at what we're talking about here.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.840
They're pretty easy to build, and
the fact that, like, you can just

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.630
go, like, sand's there, let's go.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.110
We just build it and we go, but what
happens is quickly the waves come

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.950
up and crash on that sand castle.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.790
So the sand would have been easier for the
foolish guy, right, to start immediately.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:10.589
It didn't cost much to be able
to build that home on there.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.530
So I would get me to think about
just foundation in general.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:17.330
And so anybody ever studied
about how skyscrapers are built?

00:15:18.435 --> 00:15:21.345
Do you know that the majority of
their time and efforts built below

00:15:21.345 --> 00:15:23.075
the ground, not above the ground?

00:15:23.525 --> 00:15:26.085
Now we look at these massive things
that are built and we want to just,

00:15:26.295 --> 00:15:32.474
ah, but they spent so much time,
effort and money to build lower first.

00:15:32.854 --> 00:15:33.705
It's called foundation.

00:15:33.705 --> 00:15:38.455
Sometimes they go as deep as 250 feet
to make sure that they have a firm

00:15:38.455 --> 00:15:40.895
foundation before they ever build on top.

00:15:41.135 --> 00:15:42.574
Is anybody catching my drift here?

00:15:42.905 --> 00:15:45.104
Is anybody catching what the
word of God here is saying about

00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:50.840
our lives and how important it
The firm foundation is, right?

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.680
So they started at the same
place, meaning like they had the

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.670
dream of building a home, right?

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:01.999
They had the word of God, but yet both
of them chose to start at a different

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.450
place, where their foundation started.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:05.809
And I started just even
thinking about this.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.420
Just think about maybe this room,
that these two men or these two

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.750
people could be in this room.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.230
You may be sitting there today
and even thinking about this.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.380
You could be in this room.

00:16:15.255 --> 00:16:17.295
And you're hearing the Word of God today.

00:16:17.965 --> 00:16:19.155
You're hearing the Word of God today.

00:16:19.435 --> 00:16:23.245
And it's a hard truth to understand
this, that if we're hearing, any of

00:16:23.245 --> 00:16:27.465
us, including myself, if we're hearing
this Word today, and we are walking

00:16:27.465 --> 00:16:33.285
away, and ignoring the Word, the
Bible clearly says that we are fools.

00:16:34.395 --> 00:16:35.205
Now that sounds harsh.

00:16:35.205 --> 00:16:36.455
Does anybody think that sounds unharsh?

00:16:36.465 --> 00:16:40.015
If somebody walked up to you and called
you a fool, I probably would punch them.

00:16:40.885 --> 00:16:42.805
But the Bible says, what
is a foolish person?

00:16:43.855 --> 00:16:47.335
It's one who doesn't apply spiritual
truths to life's decisions.

00:16:48.205 --> 00:16:51.594
So it's not being mean or
rude, it's being truthful.

00:16:51.635 --> 00:16:53.095
Because sometimes truth hurts.

00:16:53.845 --> 00:16:56.755
So if we take this word today,
and we don't apply it to our

00:16:56.755 --> 00:16:57.704
lives, we're being foolish.

00:16:57.715 --> 00:17:00.994
But if we take this word and
we apply it, we are being wise.

00:17:01.584 --> 00:17:04.564
And just so you know, there's been
times where I've sat under the

00:17:04.564 --> 00:17:08.054
word, and I've heard it, and I've
walked away and I've ignored it.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.610
And it didn't bring value to me,
and typically what would happen

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:15.569
is when I did not add that to
my life, that there were issues.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.880
There was things that I regretted
and wished I would have followed.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.310
So I think we have moments
like that in our life.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.130
But some of us are constantly
living our lives this way.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.920
And so when we think about the issues
or the, going back to the foundation,

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:33.210
the cracks in our life, the reason why
we aren't addressing those issues in

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.900
our lives is because acting on God's
word is not a priority in our life.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.880
Listening is.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.880
I'm going to say that again.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:45.990
One of the main reasons why we continue to
have cracks, and we just try to hopefully

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.870
cover them up, and we don't address
the deep down issues of our foundation,

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:56.479
is because we would rather listen to
the Word of God, than to act on it.

00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.839
That's tough.

00:18:01.429 --> 00:18:01.979
Think about it.

00:18:02.109 --> 00:18:03.810
It's easier to just, I'm just
going to kind of walk through this.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.190
It's easier to listen to your
Christian music, It's easier to,

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.620
I'm not against Christian mission,
by the way, I love it, um, it's

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.740
easier to listen to a pastor preach.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:17.240
It, it, it's easy to listen
to, to us each week talk about

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.159
the importance of community,
getting inspired, inspire groups.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:24.720
It's easy for you to listen that, that
you need to give your life to Jesus,

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.540
that it will transform your life.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.830
It's easy to listen to that.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.780
And even kind of inside,
internally, desire that.

00:18:32.449 --> 00:18:34.760
But to act on it is hard.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:36.270
It's hard.

00:18:38.189 --> 00:18:42.250
I would say that for most of us, action
is one of the hardest things in our faith.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:43.969
So let's talk about that.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.310
Action is the key to a wise life.

00:18:46.629 --> 00:18:47.520
That's what this story is saying.

00:18:47.529 --> 00:18:51.540
Action is a key to a wise life, right?

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.480
So the word of God is powerful and active.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.300
Some of you are going to have to
really theologically think about this.

00:18:57.669 --> 00:19:02.219
The word of God is powerful
and active when we move.

00:19:05.374 --> 00:19:06.034
Don't believe me?

00:19:06.475 --> 00:19:07.284
Let's talk about the Bible.

00:19:08.044 --> 00:19:10.164
So Moses, what did God say?

00:19:10.294 --> 00:19:13.814
Lift up your staff, and the sea parted.

00:19:15.084 --> 00:19:18.614
What did he tell the priests that
were going to go into the promised

00:19:18.614 --> 00:19:21.674
land, but they had this, you
know, river that was overflowing,

00:19:21.704 --> 00:19:22.774
that they had to walk through?

00:19:22.774 --> 00:19:25.934
He told them that you have to put
every one of your feet in the water,

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:30.165
and until every foot is in the
water, That water will not recede.

00:19:30.625 --> 00:19:33.995
And it took the last priest to put
the last foot in the water, even

00:19:33.995 --> 00:19:35.985
though it was a crazy river happening.

00:19:36.104 --> 00:19:39.794
And the moment that happened,
the water began to move.

00:19:40.915 --> 00:19:41.564
What about Mary?

00:19:41.564 --> 00:19:43.264
I think this is a fun one to
begin to study about this.

00:19:43.264 --> 00:19:44.024
What about Mary?

00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:48.514
You know, Jesus came to, to
raise Lazarus from the dead.

00:19:48.514 --> 00:19:49.405
And what did he tell Mary?

00:19:49.604 --> 00:19:50.774
Remove the rock.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.130
It's those moments where God
wants to work in our lives.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.550
He so desires to, and His
Word communicates that He

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:01.200
wants to work in your life.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:08.749
But we are refusing to act on that
Word, to experience what God has for us.

00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.469
Amen.

00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:13.389
I'll say amen.

00:20:13.389 --> 00:20:13.939
That was good.

00:20:14.309 --> 00:20:15.419
I think all of us need that.

00:20:15.989 --> 00:20:16.229
Right?

00:20:16.229 --> 00:20:20.589
So, why does the power of God's
Word wait until we have to move?

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.629
It's, it's this right here.

00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:28.259
It waits for action so that walking
by faith, that we're walking

00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:30.199
by faith, not talking by faith.

00:20:30.969 --> 00:20:34.649
That we're walking by faith,
not just talking by faith.

00:20:34.819 --> 00:20:35.639
James 1.

00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:38.759
22 says, be doers of the
word, not just hearers.

00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:40.870
To be doers of the word, not just hearers.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.270
And let me just kind of line up
here so I can quickly address

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.449
anybody that would say, are you
preaching a works based salvation?

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.639
Absolutely not.

00:20:50.219 --> 00:20:55.169
Jesus changes our lives because we
accept his sacrifice on the cross.

00:20:55.189 --> 00:21:00.009
At that moment, the Spirit of God
lives inside of us, which transforms

00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:02.179
our life to act differently.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.949
Not because we have to, but because
God so loves us that the Spirit of

00:21:07.949 --> 00:21:10.289
God won't let us sit and not act.

00:21:11.779 --> 00:21:14.319
I hope you're hearing what
I believe the Bible clearly

00:21:14.319 --> 00:21:15.699
communicates about salvation.

00:21:16.365 --> 00:21:19.465
And what a follower of
Jesus does after salvation.

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:24.925
So this wise man, again, he built
and acted on the Word of God, right?

00:21:24.925 --> 00:21:27.225
He heard from the Word
of God and he responded.

00:21:27.865 --> 00:21:30.645
But many of us today, we may
not be letting the Word of God

00:21:30.765 --> 00:21:32.524
guide and direct our lives.

00:21:33.094 --> 00:21:37.264
And we sometimes even refuse to allow
God's Word to be applied to our lives.

00:21:37.314 --> 00:21:38.694
We'll say statements like this.

00:21:39.254 --> 00:21:40.584
I've said statements like this before.

00:21:40.594 --> 00:21:41.514
God, use me.

00:21:42.204 --> 00:21:43.444
God, change me.

00:21:43.504 --> 00:21:44.624
God, send me.

00:21:45.024 --> 00:21:49.534
But we refuse to move forward and I
want to give you guys an example that

00:21:49.625 --> 00:21:52.274
you may have heard before you ever
hear About the guy that was stuck on

00:21:52.274 --> 00:21:53.915
the roof of his house during a flood.

00:21:53.915 --> 00:21:57.304
Now again, this is a Story, I don't
think this is a real story, right?

00:21:57.304 --> 00:21:59.245
But it's a story that kind of
gives you the example here.

00:21:59.425 --> 00:22:06.455
He's sitting on this house and he
begins to pray intently Lord save me a

00:22:06.455 --> 00:22:08.524
Couple hours later a rowboat pulls up.

00:22:08.955 --> 00:22:13.815
Hey jump in he says nope I prayed
and God said, He's going to save me.

00:22:13.835 --> 00:22:15.304
I believe it in faith.

00:22:15.705 --> 00:22:16.264
I'm good.

00:22:16.365 --> 00:22:17.455
Guy drives off.

00:22:18.365 --> 00:22:19.435
Another boat comes up.

00:22:19.544 --> 00:22:21.715
Hey, jump in.

00:22:21.725 --> 00:22:22.444
I'll save you.

00:22:22.725 --> 00:22:24.235
And he says, No, I'm good.

00:22:24.235 --> 00:22:24.794
I prayed.

00:22:25.885 --> 00:22:26.885
God's going to save me.

00:22:26.964 --> 00:22:29.514
The last one was a helicopter.

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:30.675
I said, Come on.

00:22:31.759 --> 00:22:33.590
Grab onto the rope,
we'll pull you to safety.

00:22:33.679 --> 00:22:36.300
No, I believe in God,
God is gonna save me.

00:22:36.499 --> 00:22:37.330
Well, guess what happened?

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:41.329
The floods rose, he died, went to heaven,
and said, God, why didn't you save me?

00:22:42.479 --> 00:22:45.149
And here's specifically
what his words were, right?

00:22:45.979 --> 00:22:47.209
What more did you expect?

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.110
I sent you a helicopter and two boats.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.520
Sometimes in life, we want
more than the word of God.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.840
It's almost like when there were
people in Jesus time, it was like,

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.060
just show us one more miracle.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.020
I need just one more.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:02.930
Just give me one more.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.420
And Jesus is like, I
could show you a million.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.409
And that wouldn't change your heart until
you act on the faith and what I've already

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.070
presented, you'll experience no more.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:17.090
Glad you guys are just
enjoying this message today.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.290
Maybe you're, it's doing
the same thing it did to me.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.140
It's getting down deep into our
hearts and it's challenging our faith.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.139
It's challenging our faith.

00:23:27.905 --> 00:23:29.985
I want to share with you guys just a
couple of personal examples because

00:23:29.985 --> 00:23:31.165
I think this really matches up.

00:23:31.375 --> 00:23:35.735
I lived in the world consistently
and have at times this world

00:23:35.775 --> 00:23:38.004
of faith without action.

00:23:38.705 --> 00:23:41.655
I'll just give you my personal
testimony a little bit where, uh, I

00:23:41.655 --> 00:23:44.504
remember sitting under the Word of
God for a solid year of the church.

00:23:45.065 --> 00:23:48.005
And I remember finally starting to
break down some of the barriers and

00:23:48.015 --> 00:23:49.645
hearing some of the truths of God.

00:23:49.645 --> 00:23:53.035
And I remember hearing it over and
over and again and I kept wondering

00:23:53.045 --> 00:23:55.085
why my life wasn't changing.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:00.100
And there came a point where the Lord
inside of me, He began to just convict me.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.650
It's because you haven't moved.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.380
You haven't acted.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.169
You haven't professed me.

00:24:07.699 --> 00:24:09.900
And so I remember a Sunday
night, we came back to service.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.190
We never went to Sunday night service.

00:24:11.339 --> 00:24:14.009
But when we went there, there was 20
people in an auditorium of about 800,

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.850
which means you can't hide in there.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.950
And when the pastor says, does
anyone want to give their lives

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.350
to Christ, my hand went up.

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:23.200
At that point, I knew I had to act.

00:24:24.219 --> 00:24:27.300
And let me just tell you that
the moment that I act, my life

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.800
was so transformed, wasn't it?

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.310
And was it perfect?

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.220
Did I act every time?

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.310
No, there was times
where I struggled to act.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.350
But then over and over again, God
continually challenges us to act.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.300
I acted by following through
with Believer's Baptism.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:43.040
I acted by getting more committed to
our church, and becoming a member, and

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.270
serving, and growing in my faith by
daily getting in the Word, and at times,

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:50.630
daily rejecting the Word because I didn't
like it, but then at times accepting it.

00:24:51.195 --> 00:24:53.835
I remember our call
here to church planning.

00:24:53.895 --> 00:24:57.485
I remember sitting there in 2018, I
started thinking through this, 2018,

00:24:57.695 --> 00:24:58.685
I called it spiritual discontentment.

00:24:59.785 --> 00:25:05.254
In the midst of spiritual discontentment
was this wrestling of not wanting

00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:07.744
to act because what we had was good.

00:25:08.345 --> 00:25:09.284
We had comfort.

00:25:09.415 --> 00:25:10.315
We had family.

00:25:10.425 --> 00:25:13.735
We had our future home that we thought we
were going to live in and raise our kids.

00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:18.375
We were comfortable, but the
spirit of God kept convicting.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.650
And he says, I want to build your life.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.880
Where's your foundation?

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.120
Is it in your comfort?

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.599
And we had to come to the
conclusion that God was sending us.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.070
And it is hard to surrender.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:37.260
It is hard to say yes, but I'm going
to tell you on the other side of yes,

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:42.670
it's a blessing and an experience
with God that you can't even imagine.

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:45.180
You can't even imagine.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.550
And so I would say this.

00:25:48.215 --> 00:25:53.415
The hardest part of faith, the hardest
part of our faith is taking that step

00:25:53.705 --> 00:25:55.125
after hearing from the Word of God.

00:25:56.384 --> 00:25:57.244
I, I believe this.

00:25:57.295 --> 00:25:59.605
I believe, because I don't know
everybody in this room, but I believe

00:25:59.605 --> 00:26:01.165
many of you hear from the Word of God.

00:26:01.575 --> 00:26:04.675
I believe many of you sit here on a Sunday
morning and you hear the Word of God and

00:26:04.765 --> 00:26:09.445
inside you are welling up because you
want, you want to take a step of faith.

00:26:09.475 --> 00:26:10.495
I believe it.

00:26:12.485 --> 00:26:14.525
But many of us will leave here.

00:26:15.125 --> 00:26:16.955
And the further we get
away from the Word of God.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.960
We refuse to take that step
because we're afraid of the

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.390
sacrifice that we'll have to take.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:27.040
We're afraid of the change that's
gonna have to happen in our lives.

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:29.940
But I'll just tell you, it's worth it.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.170
It is 100% worth it.

00:26:32.979 --> 00:26:38.570
So not fully knowing what's on the other
side of our yes makes us struggle to say

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.080
yes to what God is challenging us to do.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.850
One of the things that I know I struggle
with as a believer is, what if I fail?

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.010
And I've learned this over and over again.

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.010
I had a friend that went with
us to Ghana, West Africa, and my

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:51.530
past church to a mission trip.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.830
And she said, you know what
got me to go on this trip?

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.920
Realizing that I can't fail.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:02.239
Because if God is sending me, God is the
one that is going to make this thing work.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:02.960
Not me.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.570
And was able to help her have
the faith to take the step.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:07.870
Because she knew it wasn't on her.

00:27:09.105 --> 00:27:11.105
And so I just want to share with
you as a church, I really want

00:27:11.105 --> 00:27:12.024
to challenge you with the church.

00:27:12.325 --> 00:27:16.174
There's times where I begin to look at
where our church is, you know, we're two

00:27:16.175 --> 00:27:18.845
and a half years into launching, three
and a half years since our families moved

00:27:18.845 --> 00:27:19.934
here, and I look at where our church is.

00:27:20.064 --> 00:27:22.445
We're in a great space and we
have a good group of people.

00:27:22.445 --> 00:27:23.055
I mean, look around.

00:27:23.055 --> 00:27:24.154
This is some beautiful people here.

00:27:24.155 --> 00:27:24.405
Right?

00:27:24.405 --> 00:27:26.024
I'm just trying to encourage you.

00:27:26.335 --> 00:27:30.794
Um, but we have some great, amazing
people, but there's a sense inside of me

00:27:31.385 --> 00:27:37.805
that many of us in this room are missing
out on experiencing what God has for us.

00:27:37.805 --> 00:27:37.864
Amen.

00:27:38.195 --> 00:27:41.195
Because of our unwillingness
to take a next step.

00:27:42.125 --> 00:27:44.825
One of our biggest challenges as a
leadership, and you're gonna continue

00:27:44.825 --> 00:27:47.585
to hear more about this, is we want
everybody in this church, every single

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:49.535
person that we know to take a next step.

00:27:50.225 --> 00:27:54.125
I don't care if that's to, to faith,
to, to baptism, to coming into

00:27:54.125 --> 00:27:56.705
an inspire group, to serving, to
going out and living your faith,

00:27:56.705 --> 00:27:58.085
out to being in the word every day.

00:27:58.085 --> 00:28:01.175
We want everybody to take a
next step because we believe

00:28:01.175 --> 00:28:02.315
God's called us to action.

00:28:02.315 --> 00:28:02.705
Amen.

00:28:03.835 --> 00:28:06.555
And that's something that I have
a desire and passion to see.

00:28:06.555 --> 00:28:12.695
Our leadership has a desire and passion to
see God has a passion to see you do this.

00:28:13.944 --> 00:28:17.985
But what we're gonna have to ask ourselves
this question is where is our foundation?

00:28:18.234 --> 00:28:20.204
Is it in what we can control?

00:28:20.394 --> 00:28:24.895
Or is it in Christ and what knowing
that he controls everything?

00:28:25.375 --> 00:28:26.755
He controls everything.

00:28:27.115 --> 00:28:31.790
When I think about giving our lives to
Christ I think about this, that He says

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.380
that we are to surrender our lives to Him.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.600
Then He says this, we
were bought with a price.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:45.130
Jesus dying on the cross, and us accepting
His payment for our sins, purchased us.

00:28:46.009 --> 00:28:50.400
And we are now His, which
means we do His will.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:51.550
What did we talk about last week?

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.980
We are called to do
the will of the Father.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.160
We are called to do
the will of the Father.

00:28:56.725 --> 00:28:59.705
And so God is challenging us
through this word in this.

00:29:00.585 --> 00:29:04.105
But here's what we realize, if you're
wondering, well, I think I have a good

00:29:04.105 --> 00:29:08.564
solid foundation, and I believe I do,
and I think I built on the right place

00:29:08.564 --> 00:29:11.044
and on the right ground, how do we know?

00:29:12.024 --> 00:29:16.274
Well, I would say this, the
storms of our life truly reveal

00:29:16.284 --> 00:29:18.705
where our foundation is, right?

00:29:19.115 --> 00:29:20.485
Both of them built a home.

00:29:21.235 --> 00:29:24.274
And when you begin to look at it and
tell it rained, they may have really

00:29:24.284 --> 00:29:25.715
thought that they both were successful.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.300
Both made it.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.370
We built the home we wanted
to, the family, the life, the

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:30.420
ministry that we wanted to.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:31.590
It's great.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:32.910
Things are flourishing.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.430
Until the storm came.

00:29:34.659 --> 00:29:36.040
The same storm hit them.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.949
And if you really look at these
terms, it's rain, it's, uh, lots

00:29:39.949 --> 00:29:42.400
of flooding, and, uh, lots of wind.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.350
This is a hurricane.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.740
Those are some of the worst storms.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.970
So you may say, well, I've had some
small storms and everything's worked out.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.629
It's the big storms of life that will
really help you determine whether

00:29:53.629 --> 00:29:55.420
your foundation was in Christ or not.

00:29:56.437 --> 00:29:58.627
So here's the question when
we look at these two stories.

00:29:58.637 --> 00:30:01.897
One, it says his life was solid, right?

00:30:01.897 --> 00:30:04.367
He was on the solid foundation
and it wasn't wrecked.

00:30:04.367 --> 00:30:08.857
But one, it says that his house
collapsed and it was with a great crash.

00:30:09.787 --> 00:30:12.967
Why do you believe that God allows
storms to come into your life?

00:30:15.977 --> 00:30:16.927
To make you stronger?

00:30:18.187 --> 00:30:18.897
Anybody else?

00:30:19.907 --> 00:30:22.107
To find your weaknesses?

00:30:22.107 --> 00:30:22.347
Yeah?

00:30:22.357 --> 00:30:25.357
I want you to turn to him.

00:30:26.117 --> 00:30:27.617
All those are great reasons why.

00:30:27.797 --> 00:30:29.807
God doesn't do it
because, oh, he hates me.

00:30:30.347 --> 00:30:35.227
He allows storms to come because He wants
you to know where you stand in your faith.

00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:37.047
He doesn't want you to wonder.

00:30:37.307 --> 00:30:38.357
He wants you to know.

00:30:38.527 --> 00:30:44.247
And those storms typically point us
to Christ and to His need, right?

00:30:44.247 --> 00:30:48.147
So these storms are designed to reveal
where we stand, with a firm foundation

00:30:48.147 --> 00:30:52.127
or not, where we stand in our faith,
with a solid faith or a lack of faith.

00:30:53.177 --> 00:30:55.337
So God already knows
where your foundation is.

00:30:56.337 --> 00:30:57.377
The question is, do we?

00:30:57.707 --> 00:31:02.367
And I want to read this last story to you
in Luke, chapter 8, verses 22 through 25.

00:31:02.367 --> 00:31:03.747
They're going to be on the screen here.

00:31:04.477 --> 00:31:07.627
And I want to read this because
it's talking about the disciples

00:31:07.627 --> 00:31:09.507
going through a storm, right?

00:31:09.507 --> 00:31:11.197
Going through a storm,
here's the crazy part.

00:31:11.387 --> 00:31:14.247
Going through a storm with
Jesus physically in the boat.

00:31:14.947 --> 00:31:16.587
So you would think, hey, we're good.

00:31:16.897 --> 00:31:19.357
And most of you, if you've read the
Bible before, or maybe you grew up

00:31:19.367 --> 00:31:20.947
in the church, you know this story.

00:31:20.947 --> 00:31:24.242
But if not, Let this be
new and speak to you today.

00:31:24.362 --> 00:31:29.812
So Luke 8, 22 through 25, it says
this, One day he, speaking of Jesus,

00:31:30.022 --> 00:31:33.562
and his disciples got into the
boat, and he told them, let's cross

00:31:33.562 --> 00:31:34.912
over to the other side of the lake.

00:31:35.882 --> 00:31:39.372
So they set out, and as they
were sailing, he fell asleep.

00:31:39.682 --> 00:31:43.042
And then a fierce windstorm came
down on the lake, and they were

00:31:43.042 --> 00:31:44.852
being swamped, and were in danger.

00:31:45.752 --> 00:31:49.032
And they came and they woke
him up, and they said, Master,

00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:50.312
Master, we're going to die.

00:31:50.932 --> 00:31:54.242
And then he got up and he rebuked
the wind and the raging waves.

00:31:54.502 --> 00:31:57.242
And so they ceased, and there was a calm.

00:31:57.662 --> 00:31:59.982
And he said to them, Where is your faith?

00:32:00.682 --> 00:32:04.732
And they were fearful and amazed,
asking one another, Who then is this?

00:32:04.952 --> 00:32:07.612
He commands even the winds and
the waves, and they obey him.

00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:09.432
Let's think about this story for a minute.

00:32:09.942 --> 00:32:14.912
This group of guys who follow
Jesus from the outside perspective,

00:32:15.522 --> 00:32:16.622
they were followers of Jesus.

00:32:16.992 --> 00:32:19.042
And in this moment, maybe they
were, maybe they weren't, I'm not

00:32:19.082 --> 00:32:20.192
really here to determine that.

00:32:20.312 --> 00:32:21.802
But they were following Jesus.

00:32:22.022 --> 00:32:24.332
And Jesus said, we're going to get
in the boat and go on the other side.

00:32:24.932 --> 00:32:26.192
Simple enough, we got in the boat.

00:32:26.392 --> 00:32:29.342
And everything was fine until
the boat started rocking.

00:32:29.892 --> 00:32:31.022
And the wind started coming.

00:32:31.492 --> 00:32:34.912
But one of the key things
here is Jesus was sleeping.

00:32:35.322 --> 00:32:36.272
Jesus was sleeping.

00:32:36.602 --> 00:32:39.772
And I think when we think about this,
anybody ever get angry whenever somebody's

00:32:39.772 --> 00:32:42.342
sitting down on the couch and you're
cleaning up after and you're like, what

00:32:42.342 --> 00:32:43.252
are you doing over there sitting down?

00:32:43.272 --> 00:32:44.212
You should get up and help me.

00:32:45.182 --> 00:32:46.262
I've never said that.

00:32:46.862 --> 00:32:48.272
And I've never sat on the couch either.

00:32:49.752 --> 00:32:50.332
Okay.

00:32:50.512 --> 00:32:51.462
Glad my wife's in the...

00:32:52.482 --> 00:32:53.072
here today.

00:32:53.282 --> 00:32:54.022
Keep me honest.

00:32:54.562 --> 00:32:57.922
So, we all know maybe what
these disciples were feeling.

00:32:58.202 --> 00:32:59.502
Jesus, where are you?

00:32:59.712 --> 00:33:00.712
Now, here's the question.

00:33:00.722 --> 00:33:02.762
You ever been in the middle of a
storm and asked that same question?

00:33:03.042 --> 00:33:04.302
Jesus, where are you?

00:33:05.022 --> 00:33:06.232
Why aren't you here with me?

00:33:06.242 --> 00:33:07.812
I don't see you anywhere.

00:33:07.962 --> 00:33:09.732
Why haven't you stopped the storm?

00:33:10.172 --> 00:33:13.432
And they come to Jesus and they're
waking him up and he just looks at them.

00:33:15.192 --> 00:33:17.252
It's kind of one of those, like,
annoying looks, and then he's like,

00:33:17.262 --> 00:33:19.742
alright, wind, cease, storm, go away.

00:33:20.052 --> 00:33:22.362
And then he says this one
statement, where is your faith?

00:33:22.742 --> 00:33:24.772
Why, why do you think he
said where's your faith?

00:33:25.802 --> 00:33:27.182
I mean, it's, it was a bad storm.

00:33:27.472 --> 00:33:29.712
And Jesus wasn't doing anything
about it until they woke him up.

00:33:30.092 --> 00:33:32.062
So does that mean we just need
to go wake up Jesus every single

00:33:32.062 --> 00:33:33.042
time that we have a storm?

00:33:33.352 --> 00:33:34.292
No, I don't think so.

00:33:34.532 --> 00:33:37.352
I think we're missing a
key thought in this text.

00:33:38.162 --> 00:33:44.047
Jesus said, at the beginning of
verse 22, Let's get into the boat.

00:33:44.137 --> 00:33:46.967
And he told them, let's cross over
to the other side of the lake.

00:33:49.097 --> 00:33:49.967
Anybody catch it yet?

00:33:51.587 --> 00:33:55.167
Jesus spoke and said they would
make it to the other side.

00:33:55.667 --> 00:33:56.377
He didn't say how.

00:33:57.187 --> 00:33:58.557
He didn't say if it was
going to be smooth sailing.

00:33:59.497 --> 00:34:01.987
He didn't say if there was going to be
a good storm or a bad storm or if they

00:34:01.987 --> 00:34:03.647
were going to, you know, whatever up.

00:34:04.357 --> 00:34:05.757
He just said we're going to
make it to the other side.

00:34:06.967 --> 00:34:09.187
How many times do we read God's word?

00:34:09.277 --> 00:34:11.277
We see God will take care of us.

00:34:11.622 --> 00:34:15.552
Matthew 6, seek first the kingdom of
God, and everything will be provided for

00:34:15.552 --> 00:34:17.902
you, meaning your necessities of life.

00:34:18.652 --> 00:34:19.852
Do we hear that?

00:34:20.172 --> 00:34:22.462
Yet when the storms come,
we go, God, where are you?

00:34:22.462 --> 00:34:24.752
And God's like, I already told you
I was going to take care of you.

00:34:25.112 --> 00:34:26.792
I already told you we're going
to make it on the other side.

00:34:26.842 --> 00:34:27.752
I just didn't tell you how.

00:34:28.592 --> 00:34:31.322
And if you're anything like me,
we like to know the details.

00:34:32.122 --> 00:34:36.012
But faith is seeing what God
sees, even though we don't see it.

00:34:37.022 --> 00:34:39.242
God knew they would make
it to the other side.

00:34:40.482 --> 00:34:42.682
They struggled to have faith, to believe.

00:34:43.522 --> 00:34:47.162
Does anybody find themselves
in the feet of these disciples?

00:34:48.032 --> 00:34:50.002
Do you struggle in faith?

00:34:50.012 --> 00:34:52.422
I want to comfort you.

00:34:52.662 --> 00:34:53.702
I do, at times.

00:34:54.302 --> 00:34:55.852
But what is God's Word telling us?

00:34:55.852 --> 00:34:56.962
That we need His Word.

00:34:57.302 --> 00:35:00.002
His Word is what guides and directs us.

00:35:00.727 --> 00:35:03.377
And we need to ask this question,
what is our faith founded on?

00:35:03.397 --> 00:35:05.317
Is it founded on Christ and His word?

00:35:05.517 --> 00:35:09.137
Or is it founded on our hope
of knowing all the answers?

00:35:09.467 --> 00:35:12.467
Are we trying to choose self
helps and books and people that

00:35:12.467 --> 00:35:14.797
aren't godly in their wisdom?

00:35:14.907 --> 00:35:17.567
Or are we choosing God's
word and God's godly wisdom?

00:35:17.577 --> 00:35:19.157
Are we acting on it?

00:35:19.277 --> 00:35:22.247
Or are we acting on the things
that we have control on?

00:35:22.577 --> 00:35:25.257
So Jesus is saying this
question, where is your faith?

00:35:25.637 --> 00:35:26.367
Where is your faith?

00:35:27.127 --> 00:35:29.767
And so I want to pose that to you
as we go into a time of invitation.

00:35:30.017 --> 00:35:33.617
I believe invitation is one of the
most critical pieces of a message.

00:35:34.487 --> 00:35:35.417
Here's the reason why.

00:35:35.667 --> 00:35:42.317
Again, we can sit here all day and you
can hear everything I said and say, Amen.

00:35:42.857 --> 00:35:44.417
Because look at what those disciples said.

00:35:44.427 --> 00:35:45.367
That's basically what they said.

00:35:45.367 --> 00:35:47.297
They said, Amen, let's get in the
boat, let's go to the other side.

00:35:47.917 --> 00:35:51.357
We can say, Amen, every single Sunday.

00:35:52.257 --> 00:35:54.767
Yet, walk away and do nothing.

00:35:55.767 --> 00:35:57.457
So, I believe imitation is important.

00:35:57.457 --> 00:35:58.927
So this is what imitation is.

00:35:59.127 --> 00:36:00.927
We typically lead you through imitation.

00:36:01.297 --> 00:36:03.177
We'll take some time where I'll
just, I'll just lead you and

00:36:03.177 --> 00:36:04.817
say, Hey, let's pray over this.

00:36:05.037 --> 00:36:06.267
Let's pray and ask God this.

00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:07.117
Let's seek God.

00:36:07.117 --> 00:36:08.117
And here's my challenge.

00:36:08.287 --> 00:36:12.787
Don't leave here without
saying, Lord, seek my heart.

00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:14.447
Change my life.

00:36:14.767 --> 00:36:15.267
And allow me

00:36:19.447 --> 00:36:20.607
to Don't do it.

00:36:20.777 --> 00:36:22.697
So there's two questions I
want to challenge you with now.

00:36:22.917 --> 00:36:24.347
And then we're going to
take some time to pray.

00:36:24.912 --> 00:36:28.792
What in, when you rethink about your
foundation of your life, what in the

00:36:28.792 --> 00:36:32.742
foundation of your life needs to be
fixed so that you don't keep doing

00:36:32.742 --> 00:36:35.062
patchwork on the cracks of your life?

00:36:35.992 --> 00:36:40.012
And then when you look at this
story, look at the two men.

00:36:40.022 --> 00:36:40.752
Which one are you?

00:36:41.112 --> 00:36:41.832
Which one are you?

00:36:42.202 --> 00:36:44.982
Are you the wise person that applies
spiritual truth to your life, or are

00:36:44.982 --> 00:36:48.632
you the foolish person that refuses to
apply that spiritual truth to your life?

00:36:50.192 --> 00:36:51.632
Don't wait for eternity
to figure that out.

00:36:52.242 --> 00:36:52.782
So let's pray.

00:36:52.792 --> 00:36:54.482
Lord Jesus, we thank you, Lord, for today.

00:36:54.482 --> 00:36:58.172
We thank you so much, Lord, for your
word, because your word is truth.

00:36:58.552 --> 00:37:02.572
And when we dive deep down into this
story, Lord, we see you working.

00:37:02.612 --> 00:37:07.562
We see you helping us understand
that we, each one of us in

00:37:07.562 --> 00:37:09.752
this room, is building a house.

00:37:10.332 --> 00:37:11.472
We're building a life.

00:37:11.912 --> 00:37:14.552
We're building a family, and
we're building a ministry.

00:37:16.162 --> 00:37:19.732
And Lord, because of that, we
need to have the right foundation.

00:37:20.162 --> 00:37:25.162
And Lord, I am praying right now that
every person in this room is having an

00:37:25.192 --> 00:37:29.442
open heart and an open mind to ask that
question about where their foundation is.

00:37:30.422 --> 00:37:32.302
So Lord, guide us in
this time of invitation.

00:37:33.102 --> 00:37:36.172
So I want you to just sit right there
with your eyes closed, and I want

00:37:36.172 --> 00:37:37.312
you to just begin to process it now.

00:37:37.322 --> 00:37:39.632
I want you to ask this
question to yourself.

00:37:39.982 --> 00:37:41.282
Ask this honest question.

00:37:41.842 --> 00:37:45.197
Have I built my life on
the rock or the sand.

00:37:46.357 --> 00:37:49.107
I'm just gonna give you maybe a
minute just to process through

00:37:49.107 --> 00:37:53.407
that and ask God if you built
your life on the rock or the sand.

00:37:53.847 --> 00:37:54.577
So take some time to pray.

00:38:32.667 --> 00:38:35.337
While you're sitting there,
many of you are probably just

00:38:35.337 --> 00:38:36.487
like me as I was praying.

00:38:37.597 --> 00:38:40.257
You feel like maybe there's some
areas of your life that you have

00:38:40.917 --> 00:38:42.417
and there's areas that you haven't.

00:38:42.417 --> 00:38:45.487
And so I want to challenge you right now.

00:38:47.017 --> 00:38:50.317
So just take some time to pray, and
I want you to begin to cast those

00:38:50.347 --> 00:38:54.347
areas of your life over to the Lord
and say, Lord, I want to build this

00:38:54.347 --> 00:38:55.947
area of my life on your foundation.

00:38:56.887 --> 00:38:57.497
On your truth.

00:38:57.817 --> 00:38:58.367
On your word.

00:38:58.717 --> 00:39:04.137
So just, right now, begin to just speak
those things to the Lord about what areas

00:39:04.137 --> 00:39:08.837
maybe you're not giving to the Lord, and
that He needs to be the firm foundation.

00:39:08.837 --> 00:39:09.767
So take some time to do that.

00:39:48.587 --> 00:39:53.317
Okay, now, my guess is you also came
up with some areas of your life where

00:39:53.807 --> 00:39:55.657
Jesus has been your firm foundation.

00:39:56.427 --> 00:39:59.427
And I think this is a time where
you just pray and you praise God.

00:39:59.947 --> 00:40:01.837
Just take some time to
praise God and say thank you.

00:40:02.397 --> 00:40:04.897
Thank you for being the rock
in my life in this area.

00:40:04.957 --> 00:40:08.067
So take some time to just praise,
if you need to lift your hands to

00:40:08.067 --> 00:40:09.727
do that, just praise and thank God.

00:40:10.257 --> 00:40:12.067
Take some time to pray and
thank him for the areas that

00:40:12.077 --> 00:40:14.092
he's been a rock in your life.

00:40:15.092 --> 00:40:15.112
The

00:40:59.112 --> 00:41:02.212
last thing I want to share is
you're sitting there and you're

00:41:02.362 --> 00:41:03.702
thinking and you're processing.

00:41:05.152 --> 00:41:09.442
It's this reality that you may have
walked into this room not knowing

00:41:10.762 --> 00:41:12.702
where your foundation was in.

00:41:12.852 --> 00:41:13.362
What it was in.

00:41:13.362 --> 00:41:16.492
If it was in Christ or if
it was in your control.

00:41:17.252 --> 00:41:19.002
So I want to challenge anybody.

00:41:19.612 --> 00:41:23.672
In this room, that God may have revealed
that your foundation has not been in

00:41:23.672 --> 00:41:27.232
Him, that you've never truly given your
life to Christ, that today you can.

00:41:27.242 --> 00:41:32.422
I want to share this with you, that Jesus
Christ, God's Son, was sent to this earth

00:41:33.222 --> 00:41:37.242
to die in your place because God has
reminded us and revealed to us that we

00:41:37.242 --> 00:41:40.912
are all sinners, falling short of God's
glory and our need of grace and mercy.

00:41:41.192 --> 00:41:45.342
So Jesus took our place so that
we could have a new life, that we

00:41:45.342 --> 00:41:48.332
could have a firm foundation in the
midst of the storms of our life.

00:41:48.957 --> 00:41:50.657
And I want to challenge you,
if you've never given your life

00:41:50.657 --> 00:41:53.127
to Christ, to do that today.

00:41:53.507 --> 00:41:55.417
How do we give our lives to Christ?

00:41:55.687 --> 00:41:59.017
I believe it's by admitting your
need for Him, admitting that you're a

00:41:59.017 --> 00:42:02.657
sinner, admitting that you need Christ
in your life as a firm foundation.

00:42:03.077 --> 00:42:09.747
I believe it's repenting of that sin,
turning from it, and accepting God's gift

00:42:09.747 --> 00:42:13.837
of salvation and the Spirit of God that
will live inside you to walk alongside

00:42:13.837 --> 00:42:15.077
you in the midst of these storms.

00:42:15.877 --> 00:42:17.707
And it's to begin to then act.

00:42:18.772 --> 00:42:23.652
So again, the first two are admitting
and repenting, but the next one is acting

00:42:24.322 --> 00:42:29.032
and living that life out for Christ as
you grow in a relationship with Him.

00:42:29.892 --> 00:42:31.702
So if you want to give your life
to Christ today, those are the

00:42:31.702 --> 00:42:32.772
three things that you can do.

00:42:33.232 --> 00:42:35.282
You can sit there right where
you are and just begin to tell

00:42:35.282 --> 00:42:39.012
God, I need you to surrender your
life to Him and say yes to Jesus.

00:42:39.792 --> 00:42:42.782
But I'll tell you what that action
piece is, is telling somebody about it.

00:42:43.582 --> 00:42:46.742
So when we get done with the invitation
today, when we get done with service.

00:42:47.472 --> 00:42:50.002
If you've given your life to Christ
and you want to know more about

00:42:50.002 --> 00:42:52.862
how to give your life to Christ,
to be a firm foundation in your

00:42:52.862 --> 00:42:54.582
life, please come and talk to me.

00:42:54.832 --> 00:42:59.512
Share with me your faith in Christ so that
we can walk alongside you and help you

00:42:59.512 --> 00:43:03.402
grow to know Jesus more and more and more.

00:43:05.432 --> 00:43:07.152
So I'm going to pray for us and then
we're going to stand and worship.

00:43:07.172 --> 00:43:11.982
Lord Jesus, we know that you are God and
that you move according to your word.

00:43:12.192 --> 00:43:15.922
And Lord, I pray today that
we are acting on that word.

00:43:16.972 --> 00:43:18.462
Lord, that there's many
in this room today.

00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:21.702
I'm praying that they are
leaving with a solid foundation

00:43:21.762 --> 00:43:23.272
in all areas of their life.

00:43:23.592 --> 00:43:26.432
Lord, I'm praying that they truly
surrender the areas of their lives

00:43:26.462 --> 00:43:30.352
that, that they have maybe taken
back control or the, the, you

00:43:30.382 --> 00:43:32.872
desire to be in control of Lord.

00:43:32.872 --> 00:43:34.092
I pray that you are changing.

00:43:34.422 --> 00:43:37.812
Marriages, when we think about homes,
we're changing personal lives, Lord, where

00:43:37.812 --> 00:43:41.182
you're leading people to faith in Christ,
you're changing ministries, which means as

00:43:41.182 --> 00:43:46.792
this church continues to seek you, Lord,
that we'll see a revival happen because of

00:43:46.792 --> 00:43:48.922
our firm foundation in you and your word.

00:43:49.562 --> 00:43:53.522
God, that's what we believe,
and we believe in faith knowing

00:43:53.522 --> 00:43:54.662
that this is your church.

00:43:55.127 --> 00:43:58.237
These are your people, and you desire
to have a relationship with them,

00:43:58.237 --> 00:44:01.937
and with every person that they
know, and everyone in this community.

00:44:02.137 --> 00:44:04.837
And Lord, I know as a pastor, I want
to be a part of that, and I pray that

00:44:04.887 --> 00:44:08.837
everyone in this room wants to be a part
of every person coming to know Jesus.

00:44:10.447 --> 00:44:13.887
Lord, give the people in this
room, who haven't given their

00:44:13.947 --> 00:44:17.697
lives to you, the faith to do it
today, and take that first step.

00:44:18.057 --> 00:44:23.577
Lord, pray that they boldly proclaim
you, and they share with me that

00:44:23.577 --> 00:44:24.777
they've given their lives to Christ.

00:44:25.472 --> 00:44:29.372
But Lord, lead us to worship today
as we finish up service, Lord, allow

00:44:29.372 --> 00:44:33.482
our hearts to be abandoned to just
whatever you desire to lead us to do,

00:44:34.132 --> 00:44:35.232
and we pray this in your heavenly name.

00:44:35.692 --> 00:44:36.152
Amen.

00:44:36.652 --> 00:44:39.902
Alright, let's stand,
let's finish the worship.
