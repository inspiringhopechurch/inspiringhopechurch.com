00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.950
I love that you guys
are having conversation.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.460
I mean, that's part of a Sunday morning is
where we get the opportunity to connect.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.670
And that's why as you continue to see
each and every week, we like giving that

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.070
space of about five or so minutes to hang
out, talk, catch up and my encouragements

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.030
to, to come early and do that, do that
during the worship time that we have,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.710
uh, space for, and then hang out after.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.130
Right.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.100
And then if you don't get enough,
then which you, you probably don't

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:27.330
then come to an inspire group.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.410
It's the same exact.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.640
But it's a lot of times we'll, we'll, you
know, get to hang out in a comfortable

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.650
chair as well in the midst of that.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.860
But so today we are, um, having a
communion service and, you know, we

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:45.269
do, we, we do this about, you know,
every so often we'll have a service

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.570
that we call a communion service, um,
and we've done them different ways.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.290
And this one.

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:54.285
Um, we have invited the, the older
kids into, to participate in this.

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:57.945
Um, and, and to talk about what
is communion and, and really walk

00:00:57.945 --> 00:00:58.995
through a couple of different things.

00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:02.385
And as I was walking through what I
feel like the Lord was leading us to

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.355
do when it came to communion is it
was kind of a little bit different

00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:06.705
than the way we, we usually do it.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.255
And I would say the story doesn't
change, but how we walk through

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:10.635
it does and how we see it.

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:14.745
And so I would say this in the
midst of preparing for today, I saw,

00:01:15.105 --> 00:01:16.664
uh, communion in a different way.

00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:18.375
Not that it's changed.

00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:20.865
But I would just say this,
the Lord brought something

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:21.885
new and you guys know this.

00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:26.055
Like sometimes you read something
one day and like six months later,

00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:28.095
you read it again and you get
something different out of it.

00:01:28.485 --> 00:01:31.155
I mean, it's just that, that type of
feel that I, I would say with this today.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.945
And so if you wanna know where we're
reading, we're actually reading a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.585
lot of texts today, and I'm gonna
invite you guys to participate in

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:39.615
helping us read that today, but
we're gonna be in Luke chapter 20.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.350
Um, and we're gonna start
with verses 14 through 20.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.979
Um, and here here's my challenge
to you right now, because we're

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.640
gonna have opportunity for
everybody to jump in and read.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.860
And as you can tell, there's
not a ton of everybody.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.470
So that may be you, and I'm not gonna
point you out, but I would love for you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.179
to participate in helping read today.

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.539
So if you don't have a Bible with
you, it'll be up on the screen, but

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.300
if you haven't downloaded a Bible
app, I would encourage you to do.

00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:07.545
Um, if you go out to the app store and
you search for the you version Bible

00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:08.954
app, that's my favorite Bible app.

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:11.655
You download that it's very
simple to use and read.

00:02:11.984 --> 00:02:14.715
Um, and so if you wanted to
download that today to participate

00:02:14.715 --> 00:02:16.065
in helping read today, you can.

00:02:16.424 --> 00:02:18.105
Um, but that's just an
encouragement for you.

00:02:18.465 --> 00:02:19.305
Um, but.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.010
As we look at today, this text is
really dealing with what we would

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.200
call the last supper of Jesus and his
disciples eating the last meal together.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.370
And this is really where we get
communion from because he begins to,

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.140
to have this last supper with him.

00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:38.250
And then later we see that, um,
Paul talks a lot about us and taking

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.640
communion or having a time of communion
to remember what the Lord did for us.

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:45.135
What we're remembering when it
comes to communion is remembering

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.575
what Jesus did for us, right?

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:48.675
He, his body was broken for us.

00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:52.605
His blood was shed for us to forgive us
of our sins, to, to pay the price that

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:57.375
we deserved for our sins and to give
us salvation and hope and a new life.

00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:57.735
Right.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.725
And all these things.

00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:00.915
So started thinking about this
and you guys are, I'm gonna try to

00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:02.325
connect a couple things to our lives.

00:03:02.835 --> 00:03:05.894
That I begin to see here to help me
process through this a little bit.

00:03:05.924 --> 00:03:11.685
So who here has ever worked a job so hard
that when you got home, you collapsed,

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.575
you were just exhausted anybody.

00:03:14.265 --> 00:03:15.825
I mean, you were just worn out.

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.410
At some aspect, some point, if you felt
that way, you know, from a day of hard

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.070
work, you would almost say that you
felt like your body was broken, right?

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.250
Like you were just done, you
were completely worn out.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.970
See, I remember back when I was in
Oklahoma for the last couple of years

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.869
that I was there in the fall and the early
spring on my off day, because I've served

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:41.190
on staff at a church on my off day on
Fridays, I would actually go, um, and help

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.940
with landscaping from about I'd wake up
about four 30, get there about five, five.

00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:51.075
We would start from then we would work it
all day long in the heat mowing and moving

00:03:51.075 --> 00:03:52.815
mulch and rocks and things like that.

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:57.435
And I would come home exhausted, worn
out, just so you know, the difference

00:03:57.435 --> 00:04:00.915
between being a pastor and a landscaper
for a day, it's harder to be a landscaper.

00:04:00.915 --> 00:04:04.305
I think physically, maybe not
mentally, but physically it is.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.945
And so I would come home exhausted
and I usually, what would happen is

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:08.355
Brit would just give me time to rest.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.615
She would tell the kids
don't mess with your.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.190
He's worked hard all day.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.400
Well, lemme tell you the reason
why I worked hard on those days

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.300
is as, as a pastor, you know,
we just needed some extra money.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.870
And a lot of times it was around Christmas
because we needed Christmas gifts.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:23.580
We needed, we wanted
Christmas gifts for kids.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.430
And a lot of times it was around spring
because everybody knows around spring.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.300
It seems like everything comes up
needing new clothes and you name it.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.600
Right.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.870
Um, and so it was an opportunity
for me, if you think about it,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.210
that my body was broken or worn out
for the sake of my kid's benefit.

00:04:40.365 --> 00:04:41.295
Usually what Brittney would say.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.085
A lot of times, whenever we would buy
Christmas gifts or we would be able to

00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:46.485
get to do activities because of that
hard work that I would do, she would

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:50.715
say, Hey, make sure you tell your dad,
thank you for sacrificing his time and

00:04:50.715 --> 00:04:53.595
effort for what we're getting to do.

00:04:53.685 --> 00:04:54.465
And so our kids would do that.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.935
They would say, thanks dad so much.

00:04:56.265 --> 00:04:58.215
But you know, especially with those
Christmas gifts, a couple months

00:04:58.215 --> 00:04:59.265
later, they stopped playing with them.

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:02.985
They become old and, and they
really begin to lose value to them.

00:05:02.985 --> 00:05:05.475
They begin to not appreciate them as much.

00:05:06.165 --> 00:05:08.085
And it seems like all
they want is something.

00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:13.035
So now let's bring this story into
really where we wanna hang out, right?

00:05:13.035 --> 00:05:16.965
I'm not comparing my life to Christ,
but Christ's body was broken for us.

00:05:17.235 --> 00:05:19.815
You know, it says that his body
was broken, that he, his blood

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.825
was, uh, poured out for us.

00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:26.475
And his sacrifice is something that
at the moment of salvation, when we

00:05:26.475 --> 00:05:29.145
give our lives to Christ, when we
recognize what Christ has done for us,

00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:31.785
we celebrate and we give thanks to.

00:05:33.225 --> 00:05:37.725
But it seems like that as time goes on,
we begin to forget what God has given us.

00:05:38.055 --> 00:05:41.415
We begin to take it for granted
and we don't appreciate it.

00:05:42.435 --> 00:05:45.555
So when you look at days like today,
rich, I would hope every single

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.955
Sunday that we come together, we
remember what Christ did for us.

00:05:48.165 --> 00:05:50.505
But days like today are
days for us to stop.

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:55.455
And go back and remember what Christ
did, the sacrifice that he paid

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:58.605
so that we could experience a hope
that we could experience a life that

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.655
we could experience salvation and
forgiveness of sins and all these things.

00:06:03.105 --> 00:06:06.045
So we take days like today to
remember so that we don't take for

00:06:06.045 --> 00:06:07.245
granted what Christ did for us.

00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:10.605
And again, that's why I say my
sacrifice was minimal compared

00:06:10.605 --> 00:06:12.645
to Christ, but I see the connect.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.580
In this, right.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.430
When we forget to remember what
Christ said for us, we become

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.260
ungrateful and we complain.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.980
So maybe I'm just, just so you know that
maybe this isn't you praise God, but

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.900
me, I become ungrateful and complain.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.170
I begin to ask this question, God,
what did you do for me lately?

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.550
When God did enough at salvation,
when he did enough on the cross,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.270
see we take for granted all the
gifts, all the things and the, the

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.040
abilities that God has given us, right?

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.480
A relationship with God access.

00:06:40.335 --> 00:06:41.955
Uh, hope and forgiveness and peace.

00:06:41.955 --> 00:06:46.155
We take all these things for granted
and we don't recognize what we have

00:06:46.185 --> 00:06:47.474
and the value we have in Christ.

00:06:47.955 --> 00:06:51.885
And so in the end, when we don't
remember what Christ has done for us,

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.445
we begin to seek other things to fill
the void that we have in our lives.

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:59.325
Like my kids, they want more,
they want something different.

00:06:59.474 --> 00:07:00.255
It's not good.

00:07:00.255 --> 00:07:00.794
It's old.

00:07:00.914 --> 00:07:04.094
So for me, at times in my
relationship, and again, I don't know

00:07:04.094 --> 00:07:05.145
if I'm hanging out there with you.

00:07:05.685 --> 00:07:08.385
I want something more and it seems
like God hasn't given me enough.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.835
So what do I.

00:07:09.405 --> 00:07:12.135
I begin to try to find other
things to fill that void.

00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:15.675
So for you, it may be different, but
for some, we begin to fill that thing

00:07:15.675 --> 00:07:20.685
with other things, other activities,
other relationships, you know, for

00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:23.895
some, it could get to the point
where we are choosing substance from

00:07:23.895 --> 00:07:25.995
alcohol to food, to social media.

00:07:26.505 --> 00:07:30.795
Things that consume us and feel us that
think that it fulfills what we believe

00:07:30.795 --> 00:07:32.475
that God has, you know, given us.

00:07:32.475 --> 00:07:34.995
And, and really what we
find is, is it is deflating.

00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:38.145
It is not fulfilling because what we
realize, the only thing that is going

00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:42.825
to bring that fulfillment is remembering
what Christ did for us, that he's given

00:07:42.825 --> 00:07:46.035
us a hope that he's given us faith.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.700
He's given us peace.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.520
He's given us comfort and he's
given us somebody who takes the

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.210
cares that I have in my life and
begins to take those upon himself.

00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:58.380
And to give me something back
that is so much better, right?

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.050
My hope today, as we jump into this
text, and as we continue to read

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:05.250
through scripture today is that we truly
remember what Christ did for us, right?

00:08:05.255 --> 00:08:09.690
The sacrifice that he made and that we
start choosing Christ, we chart choosing

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.100
every day to remember what he's done for.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.670
And again, so that we can leave
outta here with a renewed excitement

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.050
about our relationship with Christ.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:21.090
So let's jump into this text, Luke
chapter 22 versus 14 through 22 throw.

00:08:21.095 --> 00:08:21.720
So I'll read this.

00:08:21.725 --> 00:08:22.620
Here's what it says.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.480
It says when the hour came, he's
speaking of Jesus reclined at the

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.670
table and the apostles with him.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:35.159
And then he said to them, I have ly
desired to eat this passive meal with.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:36.870
Before I suffer.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.699
Bri tell you I will not eat it again until
it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.180
And then he took the cup and after
giving, thanks, he said, take this

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.709
and share it among yourselves.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.550
Bri, tell you from now on, I will not
drink of the fruit of the vine until

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.810
the kingdom of God comes and he took
the bread and he gave thanks and he

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.709
broke it and he gave it to them and
said, this is my body, which is given

00:08:58.709 --> 00:09:01.590
to you do this in remembrance of me.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.930
And so also in the same way, he took the.

00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:05.655
After supper.

00:09:05.655 --> 00:09:09.944
He said, this cup is the new covenant in
my blood, which is poured out for you.

00:09:10.245 --> 00:09:11.415
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:09:11.415 --> 00:09:16.155
We pray Lord today that you're new, that
your word is new to our hearts and our

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:20.085
ears and our minds today, Lord that we
leave outta here, remembering what you did

00:09:20.085 --> 00:09:23.895
for us, Lord, that we take this with this
into our days and when to our weeks ahead.

00:09:24.255 --> 00:09:28.635
And then we allow that to fulfill us that,
to guide us and that to direct our life's.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.100
To know you more and to help
others know you more as well.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.600
And so we pray this in your heavenly name.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.500
Amen.

00:09:35.819 --> 00:09:38.819
So the first thing I wanna start with,
which I think actually speaks to this

00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:43.140
text and what Jesus is talking about, it
says when the hour came, they reclined

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.350
at the table and the apostles were
with them and they were, it says that

00:09:46.355 --> 00:09:51.240
they were, he said he had fervently
desired to eat this Passover with him.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.310
So before we can even
move on, we have to talk.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.949
One, what is the Passover?

00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:57.420
Where did communion come from?

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.310
And communion actually came from this
last supper that they had together.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.810
See, Jesus begins to describe, they were
celebrating over what the Passover was.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.050
And so just, just by raise of hands, how
many y'all know what the Passover is.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.480
Okay, good.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.699
So majority of us know what the
Passover is, but I wanna walk

00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:18.000
through it again because I don't
wanna miss what the first Passover

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.800
is and how he's talking about now.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.640
The new.

00:10:21.464 --> 00:10:23.925
uh, Passover or the new covenant has come.

00:10:23.925 --> 00:10:27.015
So the old Passover feast
was when the people of Israel

00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:29.474
were slaved enslaved in Egypt.

00:10:29.474 --> 00:10:29.805
Right.

00:10:29.805 --> 00:10:31.324
And all these plagues happened.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.120
Until finally the last one, which
is where God was going to kill every

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.829
one of the firstborn children in
Pharaoh's home and all of Egypt's home.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:45.510
But in order for the Israelites to, to
not have that happen to them, God asked

00:10:45.515 --> 00:10:47.430
them through Moses, obviously, right.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.140
To take a unblemished lamb and to
sacrifice that layman, to put the

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.730
blood above the doorpost and to
eat a meal together of that lamb.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:57.959
Right.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:04.380
And in that process that Lamb's blood
being sacrifice would save them from

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.010
what would happen to all the Egyptians
would save them to be able to get

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.130
them out of slavery and to be able to
experience the promised land one day.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.810
And that's exactly what happened.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.550
God passed over the sins of Israel
and he began to pour out punishment

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.530
on those who had sinned against him.

00:11:20.219 --> 00:11:22.620
See, that was a major event in their life.

00:11:23.655 --> 00:11:27.765
They begin to celebrate year after
year, because it was so impactful.

00:11:28.305 --> 00:11:30.824
See, when there's things like
that, that happen in your life, we

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:32.474
should celebrate them consistently.

00:11:32.985 --> 00:11:37.635
And the Israelites model that even up
to the day here, that Jesus is modeling

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.905
that same thing that they're going in
and they're having the, the last supper

00:11:40.905 --> 00:11:43.334
together they're celebrating right.

00:11:43.605 --> 00:11:45.105
This Passover mill.

00:11:45.765 --> 00:11:48.305
But as he's beginning to describe
here, and I begin to think about.

00:11:49.574 --> 00:11:54.194
as, as just a, a as, as a, you know,
United States, we celebrate July 4th.

00:11:54.194 --> 00:11:54.944
We don't miss it.

00:11:54.944 --> 00:11:57.405
We blow off fireworks because
we celebrate our independence.

00:11:57.405 --> 00:11:57.795
Right.

00:11:58.064 --> 00:11:59.385
That's something logical.

00:11:59.745 --> 00:12:02.655
And that's where I get to saying,
like, where did communion come from?

00:12:02.895 --> 00:12:06.915
Why did the pass mill happen is because
when major things happen in our life,

00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:08.234
we should take time to celebrate them.

00:12:08.234 --> 00:12:10.425
This is why as a church, we
take a complete Sunday and

00:12:10.425 --> 00:12:11.234
we say, Hey, let's talk.

00:12:12.015 --> 00:12:12.765
Communion.

00:12:12.885 --> 00:12:14.505
Let's talk about what Christ did for us.

00:12:14.505 --> 00:12:16.275
Let's celebrate let's thank him.

00:12:16.275 --> 00:12:18.945
Let's praise him for
what he's done for us.

00:12:19.515 --> 00:12:21.285
So now we see this transition here.

00:12:21.285 --> 00:12:25.455
When Jesus came to earth and lived a
perfect life and was sacrificed on the

00:12:25.455 --> 00:12:28.095
cross, he became our Passover lamb.

00:12:28.605 --> 00:12:34.335
See the old Passover was replaced
with the new one where Jesus.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.670
Came because we could not save
our, save ourselves from our sins.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.960
We could not save ourselves from being
punished for our lives that we've lived.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.710
And again, I, I really want you to think
through this guys I've been there before.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.870
We're good people, as we think,
but all of us have sinned and

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:52.740
fallen short of God's glory.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.500
There's, there's at least something
in your life that you've fallen

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.880
short at one point in your life.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.150
And if you.

00:12:58.365 --> 00:13:00.975
That means that you're a sinner
you've fallen short, but God's not

00:13:00.975 --> 00:13:02.685
saying you're a hor horrible person.

00:13:02.685 --> 00:13:05.895
What God is saying is that there's no
way that you can save yourself from an

00:13:05.895 --> 00:13:10.365
eternity, separated from him, an eternal
punishment for that sin, but God can,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:16.694
and God did through sin his son, Jesus,
to die for us to be sacrificed for us.

00:13:16.725 --> 00:13:19.425
And he begins to describe this in this
text, and we're gonna walk through it

00:13:19.425 --> 00:13:23.085
in just a minute, but those of us who
have accepted Jesus and his payment

00:13:23.085 --> 00:13:26.204
for our sins, Jesus has taken place.

00:13:26.835 --> 00:13:27.675
Our place, right?

00:13:27.675 --> 00:13:32.385
So when God judges the world,
he will pass over our sins.

00:13:34.155 --> 00:13:37.305
And he, as he judges the whole world,
those who have not accepted Christ, he

00:13:37.305 --> 00:13:40.935
will not pass over their sins and they
will be held accountable for theirs.

00:13:41.205 --> 00:13:42.675
Is that narrow minded?

00:13:42.675 --> 00:13:44.085
I actually don't believe it is.

00:13:44.715 --> 00:13:45.705
I, I would say this.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:50.055
If, if somebody had a, a ship
wreck and somebody threw out a

00:13:50.055 --> 00:13:51.735
life rat for every single person.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.970
Half of 'em decided not
to choose the life raft.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:02.520
Was it their fall fault or the person
thrown out the raft, it was their choice.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.110
And that would be horrible.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.430
Why wouldn't they choose the life raft?

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.990
Because sometimes what we think with the
life raft is the life raft is narrow.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.530
The life raft is not better
than just no raft at all.

00:14:14.385 --> 00:14:16.875
But it's because the enemy
likes to still kill and destroy.

00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:20.805
He likes to deceive us to think that a
relationship with Christ and the salvation

00:14:20.805 --> 00:14:23.415
that the Lord gives us is not good enough.

00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:26.025
They wanted a boat, not a life raft.

00:14:26.355 --> 00:14:28.515
And if he can't give me a boat,
then I don't want any of it.

00:14:28.995 --> 00:14:31.605
They didn't realize that the life
raft would've been pulled back in

00:14:31.965 --> 00:14:36.255
into a glorious kingdom in eternity
with God forever, where there would

00:14:36.255 --> 00:14:38.505
be no tears, no pain, no crying.

00:14:38.505 --> 00:14:39.975
Like that's the things that
a lot of times we miss.

00:14:39.975 --> 00:14:42.345
So when we look at this, right,
those who have given their lives to.

00:14:43.875 --> 00:14:48.345
God has, is, and will continue to pass
over our sin and not judge us for it.

00:14:48.345 --> 00:14:49.665
He judged Christ for that.

00:14:50.385 --> 00:14:51.885
So again, why do we celebrate communion?

00:14:51.885 --> 00:14:54.885
Because it, this is a major event for us.

00:14:55.065 --> 00:14:56.025
They have given our lives to Christ.

00:14:56.025 --> 00:15:00.015
It's a major event for the world, knowing
that someone has taken their place,

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.305
Jesus has taken their place so that they
wouldn't be, um, judged for their sin.

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:06.285
So we should celebrate this.

00:15:06.435 --> 00:15:08.475
So every single time we come
together, we celebrate this, but we

00:15:08.475 --> 00:15:09.585
take days like this to celebrate.

00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:10.505
So let's walk through this.

00:15:11.835 --> 00:15:13.005
and then we'll, we'll continue on here.

00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:15.735
So in verse 15, I'm just
gonna kind of highlight.

00:15:15.795 --> 00:15:18.615
I'm not gonna walk through completely,
but I'm gonna highlight, we see in

00:15:18.615 --> 00:15:22.035
verse 15 where he says this, then
he said to them, speaking to the

00:15:22.035 --> 00:15:27.225
disciples, I have fervently desired to
eat this pass with you before I suffer.

00:15:27.735 --> 00:15:30.585
Let me just challenge you to
think through text this way.

00:15:30.585 --> 00:15:33.435
When you study it, ask a lot of questions.

00:15:33.735 --> 00:15:36.615
And the first question I asked
as I read over this is how

00:15:36.615 --> 00:15:40.035
could Jesus fervently desire?

00:15:41.025 --> 00:15:43.935
To go to the last meal he
would ever eat before he died.

00:15:44.265 --> 00:15:45.675
Wouldn't you wanna avoid that?

00:15:46.454 --> 00:15:51.074
But let me tell you what I saw in this
and why Jesus went to this last meal.

00:15:51.074 --> 00:15:53.834
Number one, Jesus loved his disciples.

00:15:54.464 --> 00:15:55.935
He loved his disciples so much.

00:15:55.935 --> 00:15:57.314
He wanted to see them one more time.

00:15:57.944 --> 00:16:01.005
He wanted to give them one more
example of what he was gonna do.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:07.050
Through this last supper, he wanted
to show his love and compassion.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.900
If we remember we've studied this
before he washed his disciples

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.710
feet, that night he wanted to
spend every last second with him.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.040
So God through Jesus loved
his disciples so much.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.120
He went to this last supper.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:23.130
Number two, Jesus knew that this
mill would get him one step closer to

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.520
fulfilling his purpose, to bring hope
salvation, forgiveness to the world.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.430
Challenge to you on this.

00:16:30.045 --> 00:16:37.575
Sometimes we avoid pain, even though we
know that pain can lead to somebody else's

00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:41.295
hope, love, salvation, and forgiveness.

00:16:41.565 --> 00:16:47.625
Jesus chose to head towards right,
this pain, this, this suffering, not

00:16:47.625 --> 00:16:49.755
only for his disciples, but for us.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.635
And so this meal was part of the process.

00:16:52.995 --> 00:16:56.385
So he celebrated, even though this pain
he was going through was so horrible.

00:16:56.385 --> 00:16:57.645
He could look past it to see the.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.410
So then we see here, I'm just gonna
go ahead and jump to verse 19.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.910
And it says, and he took the bread and
he gave thanks and he broke it and he

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:11.190
said to them, this is my body, which is
given to you do this in remembrance of me.

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.410
So this symbol of the bread, right?

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.180
When we talk about the bread and the wine.

00:17:15.885 --> 00:17:17.325
It is all about a symbol.

00:17:17.355 --> 00:17:20.595
It's something to give us tangible
about what Christ has done for us.

00:17:20.595 --> 00:17:20.925
Right?

00:17:20.984 --> 00:17:24.254
And so when he broke this bread, it
was a visual representation of his

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.214
body, eventually breaking for his
disciples and being broken for us.

00:17:28.875 --> 00:17:32.385
And he says whenever they were to eat
it, they were to do this in remembrance

00:17:32.595 --> 00:17:34.004
of the sacrifice he was about to make.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.440
See Jesus continually told us
disciples, this was gonna happen.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.760
And most of them would not believe it.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.879
And many, if you even look at the text
that, that this was hidden from them

00:17:41.879 --> 00:17:44.730
fully until he actually gave his life
for Christ before it was revealed.

00:17:44.735 --> 00:17:46.140
But for us, we have a different picture.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.050
We look at it, we know that the
bread represents what Christ did

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.840
for us, but I want to challenge
us to look at one thing here.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.820
Whenever he says for us in this,
he says, and he took the bread and

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.230
he gave thanks and he broke it.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.450
And he said to them, do
this in remembrance of.

00:18:02.145 --> 00:18:04.334
I started challenging myself
to look at this differently.

00:18:05.205 --> 00:18:11.175
The, in the breaking of our body, in the
brokenness of our walk and our lives,

00:18:11.564 --> 00:18:16.245
the, we are to do that in remembrance
of what Christ did see if Christ was

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.094
willing to go to a last supper, knowing
that was gonna be his last meal and

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.564
that his body was gonna be broken.

00:18:21.014 --> 00:18:24.344
Then he was doing it for the
greater good of all the world

00:18:24.344 --> 00:18:28.155
so that they could experience a
hope, a salvation, how much more.

00:18:29.145 --> 00:18:33.225
Can we celebrate communion, remembering
what Christ said for us by allowing

00:18:33.225 --> 00:18:37.875
our lives at times, to be broken, to
allow sometimes the situations we're

00:18:37.875 --> 00:18:42.255
in to be difficult, not maybe for
our benefit, because we've already

00:18:42.255 --> 00:18:46.905
experienced Christ, but for the benefit
of others, I don't know about you.

00:18:47.985 --> 00:18:51.105
That gives me a little bit of comfort
because I know whenever I go through

00:18:51.105 --> 00:18:56.205
pain, it's for a greater benefit,
but sometimes I want to choose.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:57.510
No pain.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.889
And again, I'm always a
great physical reference.

00:19:01.889 --> 00:19:05.580
When I think about working out, everybody
wants to be fit, but nobody wants to

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.660
go through the pain of getting fit.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:08.490
Okay.

00:19:08.639 --> 00:19:09.780
I'll just tell you this.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.070
If I was to probably pull you guys,
everybody would say, I want to

00:19:14.075 --> 00:19:15.930
see Christ magnified in my life.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.300
I wanna be the greatest
Christ follower ever.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.980
I wanna see people come
to faith in Christ.

00:19:20.129 --> 00:19:22.139
I wanna see this city transformed.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.190
You'd be like, amen.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.660
What if it involved pain?

00:19:25.755 --> 00:19:29.355
Maybe not see Jesus is
challenging us today.

00:19:29.475 --> 00:19:31.245
He was challenged to disciples today.

00:19:31.515 --> 00:19:37.755
And in this text, us that at times
to truly celebrate Christ that we may

00:19:37.755 --> 00:19:39.345
have to be broken in the midst of it.

00:19:40.455 --> 00:19:44.635
That's tough to hear, but Christ
set a great example for us because

00:19:44.715 --> 00:19:46.035
he had his eyes on the prize.

00:19:46.155 --> 00:19:47.625
He had his eyes on God.

00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:49.635
He had his eyes and his heart.

00:19:49.635 --> 00:19:52.665
Here's the cool part guys on the
people who were gonna receive that.

00:19:53.655 --> 00:19:56.745
I know that there are several people
that have given their lives for us

00:19:57.105 --> 00:19:59.775
in this world to have a free country.

00:20:00.885 --> 00:20:02.625
I'm not trying to be political
here, but what I'm trying to be

00:20:02.625 --> 00:20:04.485
is they saw the bigger picture.

00:20:05.475 --> 00:20:10.095
They saw the bigger picture that in
sacrificing their life, that there

00:20:10.095 --> 00:20:12.045
would be some greater good of it.

00:20:12.175 --> 00:20:17.025
Jesus is on a bigger scale, but even
for us as Christ followers, we continue

00:20:17.025 --> 00:20:19.065
to live our faith out for the greater.

00:20:19.754 --> 00:20:22.635
Of knowing God is doing
something on the other side.

00:20:22.635 --> 00:20:25.395
So I believe that part of
celebrating communion is

00:20:25.395 --> 00:20:27.794
remembering that, remembering that.

00:20:28.034 --> 00:20:30.705
So then we see in verse 20 here, it
says in the same way, he also took the

00:20:30.705 --> 00:20:34.844
cup and after supper, he said this,
the cup is the new covenant in my

00:20:34.844 --> 00:20:37.064
blood, which is poured out for you.

00:20:38.834 --> 00:20:40.324
He says this new covenant, right?

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.610
This new covenant means that the
old covenant law was passing away or

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.820
fulfilled by the new one coming in.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:48.300
Right?

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:53.490
The new man, new of him paying for our
sins, see the old covenant required

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:59.760
following laws to a T doing all these
works, but the new covenant required

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.690
only sacrificing himself in our place.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:04.980
And he did that.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.420
So it is done.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.590
It is accomplished.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.410
And so I wanna give you an
example and I hope it lands here.

00:21:12.794 --> 00:21:13.845
But I want you to think about this.

00:21:13.845 --> 00:21:15.885
How many of y'all in
here have had a birthday?

00:21:17.145 --> 00:21:17.564
Hey, great.

00:21:17.564 --> 00:21:19.004
All of us can raise our hand.

00:21:19.004 --> 00:21:22.304
And if you didn't raise your hand, you
don't know yet, but every one of you

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:25.125
have been born and you've had a birthday.

00:21:26.355 --> 00:21:29.324
Here's the thing that I want you to
think about when you think about this

00:21:30.284 --> 00:21:31.754
every year we celebrate that birthday.

00:21:31.754 --> 00:21:33.105
At least I think most of us probably do.

00:21:33.105 --> 00:21:35.925
We get a cake and we say, Hey,
your day's special and we're

00:21:35.925 --> 00:21:38.145
celebrating, but we're only born once.

00:21:38.564 --> 00:21:39.554
We're only born once.

00:21:40.485 --> 00:21:45.955
See when Christ died on the
cross, it was finished when

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.655
we were born, it was finished.

00:21:47.985 --> 00:21:51.075
And every year after that, we
celebrate what was finished.

00:21:51.615 --> 00:21:54.615
We celebrate what was, what
has happened, the new life.

00:21:55.305 --> 00:21:59.595
And, and, and I know you guys, like I
get the best cake in the world, or really

00:21:59.595 --> 00:22:01.095
it's Browning cookie brownies, right?

00:22:01.095 --> 00:22:01.605
It's cookie brown.

00:22:01.605 --> 00:22:02.625
That's the best cake in the world of me.

00:22:02.625 --> 00:22:03.465
That's cookie brownies.

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:06.375
I get the best ice cream
and, and the best family.

00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:07.785
And, and I celebrate this.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:14.850
Because I was born and I
get to experience life guys.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:21.960
Communion is not just about when we take
time later during, during, uh, invitation

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.820
to, to drink the cup and take the bread.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.310
Communion is remembering
that we were born again.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.689
Because of Jesus Christ that it was
finished on the cross that I don't

00:22:30.689 --> 00:22:33.720
have to work any harder to gain
that salvation that I receive it

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.510
because of what Christ did and that
now I get to live and experience it.

00:22:36.514 --> 00:22:40.199
And every single time that I
remember what Christ did for me, I am

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.870
celebrating my new spiritual birth.

00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:47.610
See, I, I like to visually connect that
because it's easy for us to say, yeah, we

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.669
celebrate our birthdays, but why should
we celebrate what Christ did for us?

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.560
Because it was an impactful
moment in our lives.

00:22:52.679 --> 00:22:55.260
And when we do, we live differently.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.399
When I forget what Christ did
for me, I live selfishly, but I

00:22:59.399 --> 00:23:00.419
remember what Christ did for me.

00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:02.189
All the things he did, man.

00:23:02.189 --> 00:23:03.480
I just, I wanna be more like him.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.220
I wanna praise him.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.090
I wanna thank him.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.659
I wanna help other more,
more, more people know him.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:12.629
Sometimes it's tough.

00:23:12.635 --> 00:23:16.260
Sometimes our bodies have to be
broken, but my challenge to you is

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.530
maybe you haven't experienced what
it means to give your life to Christ

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.629
and to, to walk in that new birth.

00:23:21.689 --> 00:23:22.320
And, and you can.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.470
We'll talk about how you can give
your life to Christ at the end

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.470
of today and, and how you can
experience that new, spiritual birth.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:32.520
And you begin to celebrate every
single day on what Christ did for you.

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:35.910
But one of the things I want
to do, I wanna finish up today

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.100
by reading a lot of scripture.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:43.850
Here's what I am reminded that the word of
God, when is read, does not return void.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.190
When it is read, God is going
to do something through it.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:48.930
So I thought it would be great as a.

00:23:49.725 --> 00:23:55.185
To read through Jesus, going to the cross
and dying for our sins and gonna see all

00:23:55.185 --> 00:23:57.315
the things that he went through for you.

00:23:58.725 --> 00:24:03.285
And my challenge is all the things that
he did, not only for you, but everyone

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:07.835
in your influence where you work, where
you live, where your kids hang out.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.720
Christ died for them too.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.170
And so I'm hoping I'm not the
only one that's gonna read today.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.920
So I want you to do this, get out
your phones, get out your Bibles,

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.570
read it off the screen up here.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:23.400
But what we're gonna do is we're gonna
read starting in verse 39 of chapter 22.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.830
And I'm just gonna ask
for different sections.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.290
Like, Hey, I need somebody to
read this far and I'm gonna

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:29.340
ask somebody to read this far.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.450
I'm gonna ask somebody to read this far.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.130
And, and here's what we're gonna do.

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.020
We're we're gonna pass the
mic around so we can hear.

00:24:34.905 --> 00:24:35.955
Don't be afraid of the mic.

00:24:36.285 --> 00:24:37.065
Don't be afraid of the mic.

00:24:37.065 --> 00:24:39.165
And, uh, I don't know
where it's is it up here?

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:40.185
Yeah, we're here.

00:24:40.215 --> 00:24:40.545
Okay.

00:24:40.845 --> 00:24:41.835
So we're gonna pass around the mic.

00:24:41.835 --> 00:24:44.775
I'm gonna give you sections to
read and anybody can read again.

00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:47.385
You can read off the screen and
there's a lot of text to read.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:48.645
So again, don't leave it to anybody.

00:24:48.645 --> 00:24:51.105
So who wants to read the first text?

00:24:51.105 --> 00:24:53.415
It's gonna be verses 39 through 46.

00:24:54.815 --> 00:24:55.235
Yep.

00:24:55.235 --> 00:24:55.574
Awesome.

00:25:01.925 --> 00:25:06.960
Jesus went out as usual to the
Mount of olives and his disciples

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.810
followed him on reaching the place.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:13.950
He said to them, pray that you
will not fall into temptation.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:20.910
He withdrew about a stone throw beyond
them N down and prayed father, if you

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:26.130
are willing, take this cup from me
yet, not my will, but yours be done.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.460
An angel from heaven appeared
to him and strengthen.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:35.399
Being in anguish, he prayed more
earnestly and his sweat was like

00:25:35.399 --> 00:25:37.320
drops of blood falling to the ground.

00:25:40.169 --> 00:25:41.520
Uh, yeah, go through 46.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:41.879
Okay.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:46.679
When he rose from prayer and went
back to the disciples, he found

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:49.050
them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.360
Why are you sleeping?

00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:56.129
He asked them get up and pray so
that you will not fall into tempt.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:58.350
Thank you so much.

00:25:58.409 --> 00:26:04.260
All right, somebody's gonna
read 57 through 47 through 53.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:06.030
Okay.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:14.850
while he was still speaking,
suddenly a mob came and one of the

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.679
12 named Judas was leading them.

00:26:17.189 --> 00:26:20.879
He came near Jesus to kiss him, but
Jesus said to him, Judas, are you

00:26:20.879 --> 00:26:22.439
betraying the son of man with a.

00:26:23.475 --> 00:26:26.595
When those around him saw that
he was what was going to happen.

00:26:26.925 --> 00:26:30.675
They asked Lord, shall we
strike with a, with a sword.

00:26:31.215 --> 00:26:34.965
Then one of them struck the high priest
servant and cut off his right ear.

00:26:35.715 --> 00:26:39.225
But Jesus responded no more
of this and touching his ear.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.975
He healed him.

00:26:40.815 --> 00:26:43.815
Then Jesus said to the chief
priests, temple police and

00:26:43.815 --> 00:26:45.225
the elders who came for him.

00:26:45.825 --> 00:26:50.265
Have you come out with swords and clubs
as if I were a criminal every day,

00:26:50.295 --> 00:26:51.825
while I was with you in the temple.

00:26:52.199 --> 00:26:56.189
You never laid a hand on me,
but this is your hour and

00:26:56.189 --> 00:26:58.020
the dominion of the darkness.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:58.770
Okay.

00:26:59.729 --> 00:27:01.439
So 54 through 62.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:03.909
Oh.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.980
They seized him, led him away and
brought him into the high priest's house.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.500
Meanwhile, Peter was
following at a distance.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.680
They lit a fire in the middle of
the courtyard and sat down together.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.090
And Peter sat among them.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.020
When a servant saw him sitting in
the light and looked closely at him.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:29.130
She said, this man was with him
too, but he denied it woman.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:29.670
I don't know.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:35.310
After a little while someone else saw him
and said, you're one of them too, man.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.000
I am not.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.340
Peter said about an hour later.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.520
Another kept insisting this
man was certainly with him

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.710
since he's also a Galilean.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:48.230
But Peter said, man, I don't know
what you're talking about immediately.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.930
While he was still speaking
a rooster Crow, then the Lord

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.280
turned and looked at Peter.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.030
So Peter remembered the word of the.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:59.970
How he said to him before the rooster
crows today, you will deny me three times.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.070
And he went outside and wept bitterly.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:04.200
Okay.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.330
Can somebody else read 63 through 71?

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:06.500
Oh.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.860
Orville's  gonna read it.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:08.220
All right.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.290
The men who were holding Jesus
started mocking and beating

00:28:13.295 --> 00:28:15.390
him after blindfolding him.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.610
They kept asking prophesy.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:18.840
Who was it that hit you?

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.020
And they were saying
many other OUS things to.

00:28:23.235 --> 00:28:26.505
When daylight came, the elders of
the people, both the chief priests

00:28:26.505 --> 00:28:29.475
and the scribes convened and brought
him before they were Sanhedrin.

00:28:30.105 --> 00:28:35.415
They said, if you are the Messiah,
tell us, but he said to them, if I

00:28:35.415 --> 00:28:37.065
do tell you, you will not believe.

00:28:37.725 --> 00:28:39.345
And if I ask you, you will not answer.

00:28:40.305 --> 00:28:42.495
But from now on, the son of
man will be seated at the

00:28:42.495 --> 00:28:44.205
right hand of the power of God.

00:28:45.105 --> 00:28:48.165
They all asked, are you
then the son of God?

00:28:48.675 --> 00:28:50.805
And he said to them, you say that I am.

00:28:52.185 --> 00:28:54.285
Why do you need any more testimony?

00:28:54.285 --> 00:28:57.765
They said since we've heard
it ourselves from his mouth.

00:28:59.145 --> 00:28:59.505
All right.

00:28:59.505 --> 00:29:00.825
We're in chapter 23 now.

00:29:00.825 --> 00:29:03.225
So verse one through five,
who wants to read that?

00:29:05.385 --> 00:29:06.555
It's gonna read two, if they want

00:29:09.765 --> 00:29:10.185
Joe.

00:29:10.965 --> 00:29:11.265
Awesome.

00:29:15.135 --> 00:29:17.835
Then their whole assembly
rose up and brought him before

00:29:17.835 --> 00:29:20.115
pilot that began to accuse him.

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.840
We found this man misleading our
nation opposing payment of taxes

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:29.160
to Caesar and saying that he
himself is the Messiah a king.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.520
So pilot asked him, are
you the king of the Jews?

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:38.460
He asked him, you say, so pilot then
told the chief priests and the crowds.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:42.900
I find no grounds for charging
this man, but they kept insisting.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:47.910
He stirs up the people teaching
throughout all Judea and Galilee,

00:29:47.915 --> 00:29:49.470
where he started even to hear.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:57.240
So next person's gonna
read verses 6 through 12.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.139
Who wants to read that?

00:29:59.040 --> 00:29:59.639
Oh, over here.

00:30:00.419 --> 00:30:00.979
Got it Joe.

00:30:08.385 --> 00:30:12.375
When pilot heard this, he asked
whether the man was a Galilean and

00:30:12.375 --> 00:30:15.645
then he learned, he belonged to
herrod's ... Herrod's jurisdiction.

00:30:16.155 --> 00:30:20.895
He sent him over to her who was himself
in Jerusalem at the time when her

00:30:20.955 --> 00:30:25.745
saw Jesus, he was very glad for, he
had long desire to see him because

00:30:25.875 --> 00:30:29.955
he had heard about him and he was
hoping to see some sign done by him.

00:30:30.555 --> 00:30:33.435
So he questioned him at
some length, but he made no.

00:30:34.485 --> 00:30:39.254
The chief priest inscribe stood
by vehemently accusing him and

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.735
hared with his soldiers, treated
him with contempt and mocked him.

00:30:43.365 --> 00:30:45.825
Then arraying him in splinted clothing.

00:30:45.945 --> 00:30:50.925
He sent him back to pilot and har and
pilot became friends with each other

00:30:50.925 --> 00:30:56.774
that very day for before this, they
had been at enate with one another.

00:30:58.425 --> 00:30:58.605
Okay.

00:30:58.605 --> 00:31:02.175
The next one is 13 through 25.

00:31:02.175 --> 00:31:02.895
Anybody else wanna read?

00:31:05.175 --> 00:31:05.475
Amanda

00:31:12.065 --> 00:31:15.465
Pilate called together the chief priest,
the leaders, and the people and said

00:31:15.465 --> 00:31:18.435
to them, you have brought me this
man as one who misleads the people.

00:31:18.645 --> 00:31:21.945
But in fact, after examining him
in your presence, I have found no

00:31:21.945 --> 00:31:25.275
grounds to charge this man with the
things you accuse him of neither his

00:31:25.275 --> 00:31:27.075
herd, because he sent him back to us.

00:31:27.345 --> 00:31:29.175
Clearly he has done nothing to deserve.

00:31:29.879 --> 00:31:32.159
Therefore, I will have him
whipped and then release him.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.780
Then they all cried out together.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.419
Take this man away, release Barass to us.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.179
He had been thrown into prison for
a rebellion that had taken place

00:31:39.179 --> 00:31:42.929
in the city and for murder, wanting
to release Jesus pilot, addressed

00:31:42.929 --> 00:31:46.889
them again, but they kept shouting
crucify, crucify him a third time.

00:31:46.895 --> 00:31:49.260
He said to them, why, what
is this man done wrong?

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.719
I have found no grounds in
him for the death penalty.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.169
Therefore I will have him whipped and
then release him, but they kept up the

00:31:55.169 --> 00:31:58.830
pressure demanding with loud voices that
he'd be crucified and their voices won.

00:31:59.504 --> 00:32:02.685
So pilot decided to grant their demand
and release the one who they were

00:32:02.685 --> 00:32:05.985
asking for who had been thrown into
prison for rebellion and for murder,

00:32:06.254 --> 00:32:08.235
but he handed Jesus over to their will.

00:32:10.284 --> 00:32:12.055
26 through 31.

00:32:27.254 --> 00:32:28.455
As the soldiers led them away.

00:32:28.455 --> 00:32:33.585
They seized Simon from Cyrene
who was on his way in from the

00:32:33.585 --> 00:32:37.665
country and put a cross on him
and made him carry behind Jesus.

00:32:40.095 --> 00:32:42.525
A large number of people
followed him, including women who

00:32:42.525 --> 00:32:44.085
mourned and, and wailed for him.

00:32:44.085 --> 00:32:47.835
And Jesus turned said to them, daughters
of Jerusalem do not wait for me.

00:32:48.254 --> 00:32:51.375
We for yourselves and for your
children for the time will come.

00:32:51.975 --> 00:32:56.205
When you will say blessed are the
childless women and the wombs that

00:32:56.210 --> 00:33:01.514
never bore and the blessed, never nurse,
then they will say to the mountains,

00:33:01.514 --> 00:33:03.585
fallen us and the Hills cover us.

00:33:06.495 --> 00:33:11.205
Or if people do these things,
when the trees are green, what

00:33:11.205 --> 00:33:12.495
will happen when it is dry.

00:33:14.895 --> 00:33:16.965
Somebody can do 32 through 43.

00:33:17.325 --> 00:33:17.865
We're almost done.

00:33:19.995 --> 00:33:20.325
Okay.

00:33:20.955 --> 00:33:21.825
Oh, back over here.

00:33:29.145 --> 00:33:32.955
Two others, criminals were also
led away to be executed with him.

00:33:33.675 --> 00:33:37.635
When they arrived at the place called
the skull, they crucified him there

00:33:37.695 --> 00:33:42.675
along with the criminals one on the
right and one on the left, then Jesus

00:33:42.675 --> 00:33:46.305
said, father, forgive them because
they do not know what they're.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.590
They divided his clothes and cast lots.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:53.040
The people stood watching and
even the leaders were scoffing.

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:54.450
He saved others.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.410
Let him save himself.

00:33:55.415 --> 00:34:00.210
If this is God's Messiah, the, the
chosen one, the soldiers also mocked him.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:04.800
They came offering him sour wine
and said, if you are the king

00:34:04.805 --> 00:34:09.750
of the Jews, save yourself and
inscription above was above him.

00:34:10.259 --> 00:34:11.969
This is the king of the Jews.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.230
Then one of the criminals hanging
there began to yell insults at.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:23.610
Aren't you, the Messiah save yourself and
us, but the other answered rebuking him.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:30.330
Don't you even fear God, since you are
undergoing the same punishment, we are

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:34.290
punished justly because we're getting back
what we deserve for the things we did.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.630
But this man has done nothing wrong.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.220
Then he said, Jesus, remember me
when you come into your kingdom.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.580
And he said to him, truly, I tell you.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:47.130
Today you'll be with me in paradise.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.300
Awesome.

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:57.540
44 through 49 it's sorry.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.030
It was now about noon and darkness
came over the whole land until D into

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:07.770
the afternoon for the sun stopped
shining and the curtain of the temple

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:13.380
was torn in two Jesus called out with
loud voice father unto your hands.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.040
I commit my.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:21.120
When he has said this, he breathed
his last, the Centurion seen what

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:26.580
had happened, praised God and said,
surely this is was a righteous man.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:29.910
When all the people who had
gathered to the witness, this

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.890
site saw what took place.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.530
They beat their breast and went away.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.070
But all those who knew him,
including the women who had followed

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.910
him from Galilee, stood at a
distance, watching these things.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.680
And somebody for the
last one 50 through 56.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.020
Oh, Brit's gonna read

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.490
Now there was a good and
righteous man named Joseph.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.090
He was a member of the Jewish high.

00:36:04.875 --> 00:36:08.775
Jewish high council, but he had not
agreed with the decision and actions

00:36:08.775 --> 00:36:10.125
of the other religious leaders.

00:36:10.215 --> 00:36:14.655
He was from the town of Aramethea
in Judah, and he was waiting

00:36:14.655 --> 00:36:16.005
for the kingdom of God to come.

00:36:16.245 --> 00:36:18.375
He went to Pilate and
asked for Jesus' body.

00:36:18.735 --> 00:36:22.365
Then he took the body down from the
cross and wrapped it in a long sheet

00:36:22.365 --> 00:36:26.535
of linen cloth and laid it in a new
tomb that had been carved out of rock.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:29.100
This was done late on Friday afternoon.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:34.020
The day of preparation as the Sabbath
was about to begin as his body was taken

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:39.330
away, the women from Galilee followed and
saw the tomb where his body was placed.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:43.560
Then they went home and prepared spices
and ointments to anoint his body.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.280
But by the time they were
finished, the Sabbath had begun.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.590
So they rested as required by the law.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.380
You can just turn that off
and set it right there.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:52.710
If you want.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.089
So obviously we can continue reading
on about the resurrection, but today

00:36:57.089 --> 00:37:03.299
talking about Jesus dying on the cross,
I want to focus more on there, but I

00:37:03.299 --> 00:37:05.279
I'm hoping that you did what I did.

00:37:05.279 --> 00:37:10.740
Just listening to this journey to the
cross and all the things that happened.

00:37:10.745 --> 00:37:11.850
And I, I just wrote down a few things.

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:15.540
Number one, Jesus, praying in
the garden was one of the most

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.890
desperate prayers you'll ever see.

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:17.549
Jesus pray.

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:20.880
That was the, the human element
of Jesus in that moment.

00:37:21.285 --> 00:37:24.285
Just reminded me how broken he was for us.

00:37:24.405 --> 00:37:27.735
It says that he sweat, you know,
drops of blood, or some would say

00:37:27.735 --> 00:37:29.205
that he was crying drops of blood.

00:37:29.205 --> 00:37:32.595
And I don't know how that even PO
is possible, but that how is how

00:37:32.595 --> 00:37:33.975
much anguish he was going through.

00:37:34.455 --> 00:37:39.615
He even needed angels to minister, to
him to strengthen him as he got up.

00:37:40.695 --> 00:37:44.715
Then we begin to realize that slowly,
this group of people that had followed

00:37:44.715 --> 00:37:47.205
him, that he had this last supper
with begin to betray him first.

00:37:47.205 --> 00:37:47.895
It was Juda.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.270
Then again, if you read in other accounts
of the gospel, you'll see the rest of

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:55.470
'em fled and then Peter hung around for a
while, but then he rejected Jesus as well.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:59.010
And, and so all these people left him
and one things you see about Jesus

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.140
is he was so humble in the process.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.720
He just received the punishment.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.710
Again, if you read the other
gospel accounts, you'll see

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:08.880
that Jesus makes this statement.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:14.010
He says, I could call down Allegion
of angels to stop this process,

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.960
but I refused to use that power.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.100
That's the power he had.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:23.700
He refused to use that power to die in our
place because we deserve that punishment.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.790
They marked him, they beat him, right.

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:29.700
They hung him on this
cross and he died for us.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:31.110
He was broken for us.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:32.490
He bled for us.

00:38:33.464 --> 00:38:36.075
He did all that because
he loved us so much.

00:38:36.075 --> 00:38:38.384
He loved our city so much.

00:38:38.384 --> 00:38:40.875
He loved every person you're
in connection with so much.

00:38:40.875 --> 00:38:42.915
He loved the world so much.

00:38:43.125 --> 00:38:48.075
God so loved the world that he gave
us one and only son that who so should

00:38:48.075 --> 00:38:51.165
believe in him shall have eternal life.

00:38:52.455 --> 00:38:54.674
See, Jesus did that.

00:38:54.765 --> 00:38:57.134
And today we take time to remember that.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:03.480
So based on all that he did, I think
it's good that we have communion Sundays.

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.500
I think it's good to be reminded,
not just when we have communion

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.180
Sundays, but every day of this.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.780
And so again, my hope is that all of us
walk outta here with the sense to say,

00:39:12.785 --> 00:39:17.760
you know, every day that I have complete
access to God, let me go to God and

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.060
thank him for what he did for me, that we
don't just wait for a communion Sunday,

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.680
but that we use every day to do that.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.830
I'm asking God to help me with that as.

00:39:25.365 --> 00:39:26.805
For us to remember right.

00:39:26.805 --> 00:39:29.085
To not take it for granted
what God has done for us.

00:39:29.625 --> 00:39:32.685
So during an invitation, we're
getting ready to go into invitation.

00:39:32.775 --> 00:39:36.555
I got a couple things that I want you
guys to consider and pray through.

00:39:36.645 --> 00:39:39.015
And then I'm gonna talk through how
we're gonna take communion today.

00:39:39.525 --> 00:39:42.525
But what I would love to do for everybody
to be prepared for communion today,

00:39:42.525 --> 00:39:43.635
I just want you to close your eyes.

00:39:43.635 --> 00:39:44.295
I want you to bow your heads.

00:39:44.295 --> 00:39:46.425
I wanna just share a couple things.

00:39:48.045 --> 00:39:50.175
That's on my heart that I
want you to think through.

00:39:50.745 --> 00:39:52.125
So you're not distracted.

00:39:52.125 --> 00:39:53.275
I just I'm asking you to do.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.360
So the first thing that I really
want to ask this question, because

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.850
this is where I really want
you to be honest with yourself.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.950
Again, nobody's looking around with this.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.850
Have you ever taken for granted
all that Jesus has done for you?

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.850
If you have raise your hand, if you've
ever taken for granted, all that Jesus

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:09.900
has done for you, raise your hand.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:14.070
See, I know you're not looking
around, but we're all the same.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.450
We've all done it.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.690
Here's here's another question.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.730
Maybe after today.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.520
And again, I, I am impacted, I'm
gonna raise my hand for this one.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:28.080
If you have ever wanted to spend more
time remembering what Christ has done for

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.970
you, that, that you wanna be better at it.

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:31.050
And you wanna leave outta here.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:31.860
Remembering.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:35.280
I want you to raise your
hand in a commitment that you

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.050
want to remember Christ more.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:40.080
If you are just like me, where you
want to spend more time remembering

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.480
what Christ did for you and
to, to allow that to guide you.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.310
I want you to raise your
hand and commitment to that.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:48.510
So you think all of us had that.

00:40:50.385 --> 00:40:52.275
But here's the last group
that I really wanna speak to.

00:40:52.275 --> 00:40:53.925
And this is the challenge
that I have for you.

00:40:54.435 --> 00:40:59.205
The reason I want you to just pray
and seek the Lord in this moment is if

00:40:59.205 --> 00:41:01.155
you've never given your life to Christ.

00:41:03.105 --> 00:41:06.255
If, if you couldn't raise your hand on
the first one, because you've never really

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.635
considered what Christ has done for you.

00:41:08.025 --> 00:41:11.385
If you couldn't raise your hand on the
second one, because why would you even

00:41:11.385 --> 00:41:12.945
celebrate what Christ has done for you?

00:41:13.845 --> 00:41:15.525
If you've never given your life to Christ?

00:41:16.665 --> 00:41:23.384
Today is a day that you have heard the
gospel, the truth that Jesus so loved.

00:41:23.685 --> 00:41:31.424
You, you sitting there in your seat,
that he's in his son, Jesus, to die

00:41:31.424 --> 00:41:35.055
in your place so that you can receive
salvation so that you can receive

00:41:35.055 --> 00:41:39.254
a new hope and a new life and a new
covenant walk with Jesus and with God.

00:41:40.004 --> 00:41:43.214
So if you've never given your life
to Christ today, here's my challenge.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:47.550
That you do not let today
pass by before you do that.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:51.120
So if you would like to give your life
to Christ, you, nobody looking around.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.140
I want you to raise your hand.

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:55.560
I want you to raise your hand and
commitment that today is the day that you

00:41:55.565 --> 00:41:59.070
choose to give your life to Christ that
you want to give your life to Christ.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.750
Here's my challenge.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.610
If that's you today sitting in that chair
and you're struggling to raise your.

00:42:12.645 --> 00:42:14.835
I wanna share with you how you
can give your life to Christ.

00:42:15.195 --> 00:42:16.905
It's not about how good you are.

00:42:17.685 --> 00:42:21.405
It's not about saying all the
right things, but it's truly

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:24.975
about believing who Jesus is.

00:42:25.905 --> 00:42:28.215
And so if that's you today, and again,
you didn't wanna raise your hand, but

00:42:28.215 --> 00:42:29.565
you're still processing through that.

00:42:29.745 --> 00:42:33.405
I wanna give you what God tells
us in the word of what it means

00:42:33.405 --> 00:42:34.245
to give our lives to Christ.

00:42:34.245 --> 00:42:37.185
So if that's you today, if you
wanted to give your life to Christ,

00:42:37.335 --> 00:42:38.685
you would say something like this.

00:42:38.895 --> 00:42:40.245
Jesus, I give my life to you.

00:42:40.245 --> 00:42:40.965
It's that simple.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:47.339
You would say, Jesus, forgive me of my
sins and thank you for dying in my place.

00:42:48.509 --> 00:42:49.680
Thank you for saving me.

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:58.200
See, it's not the words, but it's the
heart behind those words that saves

00:42:58.205 --> 00:43:02.040
you, that you accept what Christ did for
you and that you give your life to him.

00:43:02.609 --> 00:43:06.600
And so if you want to talk more about
that, if you wanna know what it's

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.180
like to give your life to Christ,
if you want to, that's what it takes

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.620
is to commit your life to Christ.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.200
Here's what I know.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.690
And I I'm, I'm gonna end and
we're gonna go into invitation.

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:20.040
Do you know that angels
celebrating heaven when we do this?

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:23.400
Sometimes it's so scary, but
angels celebrating heaven

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.960
over one sin who repents.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.980
And I'll just tell you today, even though
I'll give my life to Christ that I'm

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.300
a sinner today, repenting of sometimes
not following through with what God's

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.320
called me to follow through with.

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.770
So I know that angels is
celebrating over my repent.

00:43:39.314 --> 00:43:42.435
But I pray if you, haven't given your
life to Christ that if you choose

00:43:42.435 --> 00:43:46.365
today that you know that God is
celebrating in heaven for that decision.

00:43:47.924 --> 00:43:50.924
So during this time of invitation,
I just challenge every one of you to

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:54.584
take time, to ask God, to renew your
spirit and give you a daily appreciation

00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:58.185
for what he's done and to guide you
every day to remember what he's done.

00:43:59.354 --> 00:44:02.834
And whenever I get done praying,
Matt and Amanda are gonna be singing,

00:44:02.834 --> 00:44:04.365
but here is what I want you to do.

00:44:05.265 --> 00:44:05.535
Kids.

00:44:05.535 --> 00:44:06.154
I want you to listen.

00:44:07.575 --> 00:44:10.095
Is there's communion
over here on the table.

00:44:11.084 --> 00:44:13.725
And we're gonna challenge you
as a family, as an individual.

00:44:13.725 --> 00:44:16.395
If you're here to take
communion by yourself, I'm

00:44:16.395 --> 00:44:17.444
not gonna lead you through it.

00:44:18.015 --> 00:44:20.504
You're just gonna come up during the
time that they're playing music, grab

00:44:20.504 --> 00:44:21.584
communion, go back to your chair.

00:44:22.515 --> 00:44:25.605
And what I want you to do is I want
you to take communion in remembrance.

00:44:25.605 --> 00:44:30.165
So whenever you take the bread out and
you remember of Christ's body broken for

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:33.945
you, that you thank the Lord for that,
you remember what he went through, the

00:44:33.945 --> 00:44:35.355
story we read through and you take it.

00:44:36.195 --> 00:44:38.865
Then when you get to the cup,
take that and remember the, the

00:44:38.865 --> 00:44:40.575
blood that was shed for you.

00:44:41.505 --> 00:44:42.585
Do that together.

00:44:43.155 --> 00:44:44.625
Let it be a moment.

00:44:45.465 --> 00:44:48.525
For you guys to celebrate and to
remember what Christ has done for you.

00:44:48.525 --> 00:44:51.975
And again, you'll have time to do that
during this time of worship on your own.

00:44:52.095 --> 00:44:54.015
Do that as a family,
do that as individuals.

00:44:54.465 --> 00:44:56.625
And then after that, they're
gonna encourage you to stand

00:44:56.625 --> 00:44:58.455
up and worship on our way out.

00:44:58.695 --> 00:45:00.255
And that's how we'll conclude service.

00:45:00.525 --> 00:45:01.725
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:02.654
We love you, Lord.

00:45:03.015 --> 00:45:04.424
And today is a good day.

00:45:04.424 --> 00:45:06.255
Lord, Lord.

00:45:06.255 --> 00:45:10.215
I am believing right now that as we
read your word, your word will not

00:45:10.215 --> 00:45:12.615
return void because it taught us.

00:45:13.335 --> 00:45:16.275
It showed us everything you went through

00:45:19.545 --> 00:45:23.385
to be forgiven Lord for us to be
forgiven of our sins, Lord, everything

00:45:23.385 --> 00:45:28.665
you went to, to come down from
heaven, to live a perfect sinless

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:32.715
life and to die across in our place.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.930
God.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.540
I pray that if there's people in
this room that hasn't given their

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.700
lives to you, Lord that today
will be the day that they do it.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:40.890
Lord, they'll come talk to me.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:41.880
If they have questions about it.

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.080
Lord, I pray that if there's people
in this room, Lord, who just like me

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:50.070
have really forgotten to celebrate
every day, what you've done for them.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.450
Lord made today.

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:58.020
Each one of us walk outta here with
a passion, with a desire, a fervent

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.410
desire to remember what you've done for.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:03.089
Lord.

00:46:03.089 --> 00:46:04.410
Thank you so much for today.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:08.069
Thank you so much for this
church, for this group of people.

00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:13.140
Lord, thank you so much for the
group of people that read God.

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.020
We, we are so thankful for
your presence in our lives.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.540
So Lord, we just pray
this in your heaven name.

00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.890
Amen.
