00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.880
Well, good morning everyone.


00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.500
Question, did everybody get one of these on the way in?


00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.060
I think the girls did a great job,


00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.240
but does anybody need one?


00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.440
Amanda.


00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.760
You were here before everybody, right?


00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.140
That helps.


00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.980
Yeah, one more.


00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.920
No, you were here before everybody.


00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.280
Anybody else need one?


00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.040
Okay, good.


00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.760
If you need more, they're up here.


00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.380
So, excited today to be able to jump into the second week


00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.080
of our series, Shalom Shalom,


00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.440
and just kind of make sure everybody's on the same page.


00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.700
Shalom, shalom is God's perfect peace.


00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.080
He talks about perfect peace.


00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.900
And so when it's repeated, it creates this perfection.


00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.600
And so God's perfect peace in the midst


00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.280
of our mental struggles.


00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.180
And that sounds like a crazy topic.


00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.720
And I know most of you were here last week,


00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.240
but like, why are we gonna jump off into this?


00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.980
And it comes to this point of,


00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.160
I think our society deals with a lot of mental struggles


00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.320
and doesn't know where to go and what we should do


00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.820
and where we should seek to find truth and help.


00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.620
And so we're willing to tackle that subject.


00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.700
Thank God it's not only on my own ability.


00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.860
So I have, again, mentioned this to you before,


00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.180
there's a group that has walked through a sermon series


00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.820
like this before, and they have a lot of wisdom biblically,


00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.020
and also from the mental health side of professionals


00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.980
that knows how to help us be able to use God's word


00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.140
to open up into our lives.


00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.820
And so we brought this into our church,


00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.840
in our context and our lives to be able to see how we can apply it and hopefully


00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.460
this is valuable for you. And so I really want to start off with this. Today


00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.440
we're talking about how God can heal our anxious minds and how God's perfect


00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.820
peace can help us in the midst of our anxiety. And I really want to share with


00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.740
you the moment that I remember, one of the most critical moments whenever I


00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.180
experienced anxiety. I remember one morning when I was a pastor in Oklahoma


00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.700
waking up and just feeling uneasy.


00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.540
And it was that moment that my feet hit the floor


00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.300
that I could not seem to find peace.


00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.620
I was overwhelmed with the day


00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.540
and everything that was coming up this week


00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.620
and I could not shake it.


00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.620
I got in my car thinking, hey, let me just eat breakfast.


00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.940
Let me just get down the road.


00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.940
Let me just get to work.


00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.180
It'll all go away.


00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.700
And I remember getting into work and it only got worse.


00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.180
And I felt like that my heart was beating out of my chest


00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.340
and I was breathing a little bit differently.


00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.460
And it was that moment that I realized


00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.660
I was basically dealing with an anxiety attack


00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.660
over my situation.


00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.220
And I love how God works,


00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.080
and God's timing always brings things into your life,


00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.720
like a scripture or a person.


00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.020
And just so happened that day as I was listening to music,


00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.020
'cause usually I do that to try to calm my anxious mind,


00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.200
and this song came on.


00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.780
And so I just wanna read these to you.


00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.860
I'm not gonna sing 'em,


00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.780
'cause you guys will not enjoy that.


00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.600
So I'm gonna read this to you.


00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.760
And this really spoke to me,


00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.660
and I'm gonna see if this speaks to you as well


00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.100
about maybe what you deal with in your life.


00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.220
And so this is Johnny D.S.


00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.300
It's the song "Breathe."


00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.340
And this is what he says in verse one.


00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.380
He says, "Alarm clock screaming, bare feet hit the floor.


00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.340
"It's off to the races, everybody out the door.


00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.220
"I'm feeling like I'm falling behind.


00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.860
"It's a crazy life, 90 miles an hour,


00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.820
"going fast as I can, trying to push a little harder,


00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.120
"trying to get the upper hand.


00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.340
"So much to do in so little time.


00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.760
"It's a crazy life.


00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.040
"It's ready, set, go, another wild day


00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.140
"When stress is on the rise, in my heart,


00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.940
"I feel you say, 'Just breathe.'"


00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.580
He says, "Just breathe.


00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.520
"Come and rest at my feet and just be, and just be.


00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.840
"Chaos calls, but what all you really need


00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.940
"is to just breathe."


00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.480
And then the next verse really rings true.


00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.780
He says, "Third cup of Joe,"


00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.620
even though I don't drink coffee, maybe this is you,


00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.340
"Third cup of Joe, just to get me through the day,


00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.600
"want to make the most of my time, but I feel it slip away.


00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.500
"I wonder if there's something more to this crazy life.


00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.540
"I'm busy, busy, busy, and it's no surprise to see


00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.260
"that I only have time for me, me, me.


00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.180
"There's gotta be something more to this crazy life.


00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.080
"I'm hanging on tight to another wild day


00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.320
"when it all starts to fall apart,


00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.940
"and my heart, I hear you say, just breathe."


00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.200
And he goes on and he says this,


00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.340
"Chaos calls, but all you really need to do


00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.260
"is to take it in and to fill your lungs.


00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.200
"the peace of God that overcomes, just breathe.


00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.380
"So let your weary spirit rest.


00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.880
"Lay down what's good and find what's best.


00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.900
"Just breathe."


00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.560
I remember hearing that verse, or not verse,


00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.560
that song in my music as I was listening to that day


00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.580
and it hit me, "This is my life."


00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.120
And I don't know if you can relate at all


00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.740
at times where you feel like that there's always


00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.980
so much to do and there's all these anxious thoughts


00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.940
and all these things that are on your heart and mind


00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.820
and you don't know what to do.


00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.200
So my hope and prayer is that today,


00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.480
as we walk through the sermon series,


00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.820
that God will be able to help you see


00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.500
how he can heal our anxious minds.


00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.740
A verse that I think of whenever I think about being anxious


00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.660
is Philippians 4, four through six.


00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.140
It says this, "Rejoice always in the Lord.


00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.460
"I will say it again, rejoice.


00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.760
"Let your gentleness be evident to all.


00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.540
"The Lord is near.


00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.380
"Do not be anxious about anything."


00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.740
Anybody ever read a verse in the Bible and you go,


00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.860
is that possible?


00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.600
Maybe I'm the only one, okay.


00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.460
This is moments where you look here and you're like,


00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.460
don't be anxious for anything.


00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.560
And you're like, is that possible?


00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.880
I think at times, guys, we struggle with it, right?


00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.360
Is it possible?


00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.720
And especially when you, I always tell people this,


00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.300
whenever you sometimes have those friends


00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.020
that will say you shouldn't be anxious,


00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.200
you're blessed, you're a follower of Jesus,


00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.640
you have a great family, you have this, this, this, and this


00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.440
and you're like, but I still am struggling


00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.280
with being anxious.


00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.760
Like it doesn't help.


00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.040
And I know they're trying to mean good,


00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.000
so that's not a knock on them,


00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.100
keep being a good friend to show up.


00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.920
But sometimes I think at times I want people


00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.440
to just sit with me, not to try to help me.


00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.440
I don't know if that makes sense.


00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.040
I just need people to sit with me


00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.540
and to experience what I'm going through


00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.880
when it comes to being maybe anxious.


00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.320
And so, whenever we think about today's society,


00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.440
we have a lot to be stressed about, right?


00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.780
There's a lot of financial pressures,


00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.200
and if you've lived in this world long enough


00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.440
in the last couple of years,


00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.380
between all of the inflation,


00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.720
all of the, everything, everything's going up.


00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.000
If you think about just, if you have kids,


00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.680
your kids' activities, you add that into relational stress,


00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.500
job stress, it makes sense why we would have anxiety.


00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.060
And so, if you're wondering, you know,


00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.320
are you the only one, the truth is, you're not.


00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.080
Statistics say, as you look at them, in 2019 they did a poll.


00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.820
Two out of three Americans said they were anxious


00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.260
or extremely anxious.


00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.000
Does anybody know what happened after 2019?


00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.980
Anybody remember?


00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.100
I think that percentage has went way up.


00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.480
And how much more can you get than two out of three?


00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.420
So a lot of people have experienced anxiety.


00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.940
And then you also see this, 91% of high school


00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.100
and college students report consistent


00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.060
and significant levels of anxiety associated with stress.


00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.060
Again, when we look at this,


00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.140
anxiety is one of the most common


00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.100
mental health issues of our day.


00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.620
And so if it is, if that's true,


00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.720
then let's talk about it.


00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.660
I mean, I think that's what we're saying here as a church.


00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.020
If it is something that society deals with,


00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.300
let's talk about it.


00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.920
This is a safe place.


00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.460
This is not a place of judgment.


00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.380
This is a place of hope, a place of caring,


00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.640
a place of saying, I get it, we get it.


00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.640
We're all on the same page.


00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.100
And what you may say is you may have


00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.820
varying difficulties of anxiety.


00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.540
Some of you, it comes and goes with opening the mail


00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.600
based upon, oh, what medical bill am I gonna get?


00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.280
It comes and goes with doctor visits.


00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.700
For some of you, it's constant.


00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.980
It's day in and day out that you're wrestling with it.


00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.500
And so it's not like necessarily we're all on the same level


00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.420
and that we don't have to be to sit with one another,


00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.300
but it's understanding that this is something


00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.100
that all of us typically deal with.


00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.080
And I want you to know this.


00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.060
Again, I'm gonna be drawing conclusions spiritually,


00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.820
But ultimately, we're gonna have some things


00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.780
that will help us from the mental health world


00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.540
that they have suggestions of how we deal with this as well.


00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.840
And I'm bringing those in, not from my experience,


00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.100
but from what I've learned.


00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.560
And so from wherever we are,


00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.120
I think we just need to dive into God's word and to see this


00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.520
and so let's pray and then we'll jump in.


00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.300
So Lord Jesus, thank you so much for today.


00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.680
Lord, we're just praying that we don't miss your word.


00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.560
We don't miss the opportunity to be ministered to from you.


00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.240
And we're just praying that our hearts are open


00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.300
to receive from you, Lord, what we need


00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.420
in order to walk through and to deal with


00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.740
our anxiety in our lives.


00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.200
And so, Lord, we just pray this in your heavenly name, amen.


00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.120
So as we look at the story,


00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.140
I wanna give you just a little bit of background.


00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.920
Jehoshaphat is a king of the southern kingdom of Judah.


00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.460
So don't wanna go too long.


00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.240
Again, there's only so much that I can cover today


00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.300
in this text with time that we have.


00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.840
But the Israelites, which were God's redeemed people


00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.200
that had went into Israel and they had all these 12 tribes.


00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.620
Eventually they began to disobey the Lord


00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.880
and the Lord split them into two kingdoms,


00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.200
the Northern Kingdom and the Southern Kingdom.


00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.040
So the Southern Kingdom was known to have


00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.240
a couple of good kings after they were split up.


00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.320
The Northern Kingdom did not have any good kings at all,


00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.520
which is crazy.


00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.880
And so the Southern Kingdom was called Judah.


00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.380
And this is where we see Jehoshaphat.


00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.200
And you can call him Jehoshaphat,


00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.760
that is a hard name sometimes to pronounce,


00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.840
so you may hear me call him Japhat.


00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.520
And the only reason why is 'cause it's very easy


00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.160
to remember, just an encouragement for you.


00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.940
If you're thinking about boys' names,


00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.600
I was gonna text Elisa, don't name your son Jehoshaphat


00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.980
because he probably will be called Japhat.


00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.200
But I'm gonna get knocked for that one later.


00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.780
Brittany will tell me that was stupid.


00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.040
So I'm gonna move on, I digress, I digress, okay.


00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.300
So as we look at this, again, I wanna encourage you,


00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.800
I'm not gonna be able to unpack every verse,


00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.420
so we're not gonna read back through this.


00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.760
We've already done that today during our prayer time,


00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.680
but we're gonna kinda hit through a couple of things.


00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.480
But I wanna mention this, just in the first three verses,


00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.420
is he talks about three enemies,


00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.860
three enemies that are attacking him from all sides.


00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.460
And when we think about this, when it comes to anxiety,


00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.540
I think typically we can handle one enemy that attacks us.


00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.060
Let me just give you a great example.


00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.660
My car doesn't start today.


00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.480
That's gonna maybe cause some anxiety,


00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.380
but you know what, I can work through this,


00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.700
I can call into work late,


00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.720
I can get a ride to work, no big deal.


00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.320
But now let's add in the car breaks down,


00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.500
which means your child can't get to school,


00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.440
which then means you also don't have the money


00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:38.180
to fix your car while you also chose to start a diet that morning. You guys know


00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:43.300
at that moment in life we had a lot of enemies attack at the same time. It's


00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.720
difficult to deal with anxiety in those moments. So Jehoshaphat and the kingdom


00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.800
of Judah understands that idea of it wasn't just one person attacking them, it


00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.480
was multiple people attacking them. And I think again when we look at this


00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.280
sometimes it's easy to think, man we shouldn't be anxious over these things


00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.400
because Jesus has got this,


00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.960
but sometimes it's just difficult.


00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.940
And so we even look at Jesus's life.


00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.080
If you see Jesus in the garden,


00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.900
again, just want you to resonate with,


00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.460
Jesus dealt with the form of anxiety.


00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.660
When he went to go pray in the garden,


00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.780
he was so distressed that he sweat blood.


00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.540
In that moment, that is Jesus experiencing something


00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.040
so overwhelming in his life


00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.140
that he asked the Lord to remove it if he could.


00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.900
So Jesus understands what you're going to.


00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.940
But I want you to know this, and this is the key today


00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.260
before we jump in and walk through these verses


00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.500
is we need to understand that anxiety is not a sin.


00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.140
It is a symptom.


00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.140
It's a signal.


00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.440
And I wanna give you a great example of why that's true.


00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.420
Couple of weeks ago, I'm in my car and I'm driving


00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.980
and I didn't have any signals on my car,


00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:46.820
like lights go off.


00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.980
I have an old car, probably those don't work anymore.


00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.020
But what I did have coming out of my car


00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.240
was like this fog smoke stuff.


00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.060
And I thought, ah, maybe something's wrong.


00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.440
But I kept driving a couple more days,


00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.320
just using a towel to wipe off my window


00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.440
because I wanted to just reject the signal


00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.760
that there was something wrong with my car


00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.340
because I didn't want to go into the car.


00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.380
But I decided that this is a sign.


00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.080
There's something wrong with my car.


00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.200
Now I want you to think through this.


00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.100
Number one, this isn't my car's fault.


00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.180
It has over 200,000 miles on it.


00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.160
It just happens.


00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.160
It's going to happen over time.


00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.900
Also, it's logical enough at that moment.


00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.340
I need to bring it into a mechanic


00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.580
'cause I don't know what to do, but the mechanic does.


00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.820
Now, that's a story from another day.


00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.100
Yes, $2,400 later, we got it fixed to praise God.


00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.420
That's stressful.


00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.260
But the cool part is when we think about anxiety,


00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.220
when we have it, it's a sign or a signal


00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.500
that we need Jesus.


00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.100
We need to take it into the mechanic


00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.780
who knows what to do because we don't.


00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.700
We have no clue, but it is a signal and a sign


00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.000
that we need to go to God.


00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.700
We need to go to God and we need to go to God


00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.620
because he is the only one that can fix it.


00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.900
I love that mentality.


00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.820
That helps me whenever I think about anxiety.


00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.020
So we're gonna look at this again, as we battle anxiety,


00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.380
what do we need to see these signs alerting us to?


00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.960
And it's alerting us to do three things.


00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.060
And the first thing we're gonna see in the first 12 verses,


00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.940
it's alerting us to pray.


00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.700
So I want us to see this in verse three, it says this,


00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.060
it says, Jehoshaphat was afraid


00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.860
and he resolved to seek the Lord.


00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.380
and then he proclaimed a fast for all of Judah.


00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.920
See that in this verse, he says he was afraid


00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.080
or terrified or alarmed or another word, he was anxious.


00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.700
He was worried about these armies


00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.960
that were getting ready to attack him and his people.


00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.340
He was anxious, so he understands this, right?


00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.660
But we see also if you read into verse four,


00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.540
he says this, he says, "Who gathered to seek the Lord,"


00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.920
and this is all the people of Judah,


00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.860
"then they came and all the city of Judah to seek him."


00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.500
I noticed something in this.


00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.740
all in those two verses, they chose to do the same thing,


00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.000
to seek the Lord, to seek the Lord, to seek the Lord.


00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.700
It says it three times, and those three times


00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.000
is that kind of the idea of this is important,


00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.920
they're not gonna go anywhere else,


00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.960
but to the Lord for this situation.


00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.660
And so as they sought the Lord,


00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.760
they not only did they seek the Lord for guidance,


00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.960
show me what to do, but they fasted.


00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.360
And I'll just tell you this, if I'm gonna fast from food,


00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.200
I must be pretty desperate, just being honest here.


00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.520
and they fasted because they were so desperate


00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.440
to hear from the Lord.


00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.800
They understood their situation.


00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.220
And when we understand our situation,


00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.080
when it comes to anxiety in our lives,


00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:34.080
understand how important it is to seek the Lord,


00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.520
to seek the Lord in this.


00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.640
And so he prays here in verse six, right?


00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.260
Verses five through, I don't even remember how many verses,


00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.080
on, I think through 12.


00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.520
This is a prayer that he prays before his people.


00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.040
But we're gonna read just verses six


00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.360
and then we're gonna read verses nine.


00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.640
He says this in verse six.


00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.680
He said, "The Lord God of our ancestors,


00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.580
"are you not the God in heaven?"


00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.980
I'm reading this wrong here.


00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.980
He says, "Are you not the God who is in heaven


00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.800
"and do you not rule over all the kingdoms and nations?


00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.820
"Power and might are in your hand


00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.780
"and no one can stand against you."


00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.520
It's this moment where he is reminding the Lord


00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.460
of what he said he is.


00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.740
And when he knows who the Lord is,


00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.460
He's reminding him, and this is the thing,


00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.960
God doesn't need to be reminded,


00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.820
but I think that's Jehoshaphat's way


00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.140
to even proclaim to his people,


00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.020
we're gonna remember that the Lord is in control


00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.060
of all nations and all kingdoms.


00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.220
Then if you'll look in verse nine, you'll also see this.


00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.020
He says, "If disaster comes upon us,


00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.400
"sword or judgment, pestilence or famine,


00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.660
"we will stand before the temple.


00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.040
"And before you, Lord, for your name is on this temple,


00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.340
"and we will cry out to you because of our distress,


00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.880
and you will hear us and you will deliver us.


00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.220
One of the things I love about this idea is it's his faith.


00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.140
His faith in his prayer is praying


00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.140
what God has already promised.


00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.260
Do you hear that?


00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.860
He's praying what God has already promised.


00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.540
We're thinking about what do we pray?


00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.780
When you say, Ben, when I have anxiety, pray.


00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:07.780
What does that mean?


00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.940
To repeat to him, to remind yourself


00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.220
and to remind God who he is.


00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.540
He got his faithful, he's done it before


00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.380
and he'll do it again.


00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.580
And I love this word.


00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.260
He uses the word will.


00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.220
He doesn't say if, he says you will hear and deliver.


00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.060
You know what faith is?


00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.980
And I'm telling you, I've repeated this to myself


00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.020
over and over again.


00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.620
Faith is seeing what God sees,


00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.820
even though we can't see it.


00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.620
In the midst of your anxiety, you are struggling.


00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.540
I get it.


00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.400
I've been there and I may not fully know your situation


00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.380
and I'm not claiming to fully know your situation.


00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.560
but in the midst, we have to see what the Lord sees


00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.500
on the other side, which is perfect peace.


00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.720
And remember, perfect peace is not the absence of conflict.


00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.340
It's the presence of God.


00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.480
I'm gonna say this again.


00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.220
Perfect peace is not the absence of conflict.


00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.860
It is the presence of God in the midst of it.


00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.900
And I'm gonna do something I don't typically do


00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.200
in my message, which is tell you something


00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.000
I'm gonna tell you at the end of my message.


00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.520
Does anybody remember Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego?


00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.160
The story where they would not bow down to this big statue


00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.680
And when they didn't bow down, they said,


00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.520
"Well, what's gonna happen?


00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.700
You're gonna get thrown into this flame of fire."


00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.360
And they're like, "Okay, here's the thing.


00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.280
If we aren't saved, it doesn't matter.


00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.300
Our God is still God."


00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.760
And they're like, "All right, you're going in."


00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.760
They threw the three of them in, but what did they see?


00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.920
Does anybody know what they saw in the fire?


00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.840
It's the fourth image.


00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.740
Most people would claim that that is the Son of God.


00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.040
Jesus was with them in the midst,


00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.660
this is Old Testament, guys, in the midst of this flame.


00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.560
He said, the king said, "Why is there a fourth image?


00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.960
And why are they standing up


00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.740
and walking around in this flame?


00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.440
And they said, "Well, have them come out."


00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.120
And so they holler out, "Come out."


00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.220
They came out and it says that there was not a smell


00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.120
of smoke on them, nothing was burnt on them.


00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.420
And in the midst of their chaos,


00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.880
in the midst of their struggle and their trial,


00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.200
Jesus's presence was enough.


00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.040
To me, when I think about having anxiety,


00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.400
it's not necessarily that there is not those things


00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:13.100
around us that causes anxiety is Jesus' presence


00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.740
that provides us peace.


00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.980
And we're gonna talk more about this as we continue on,


00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.700
because I think this will minister to you


00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.140
as we understand it.


00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.500
When we think about this reminder


00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.660
that we can cry out to God, we can be honest.


00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.460
I want you to tell you this.


00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:32.140
When talking to God, basically what Jehoshaphat is doing


00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.900
is he is crying out and being honest with God.


00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.380
It is okay to be honest with God, which means this.


00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:41.140
It is okay to say, God, I'm struggling to believe you.


00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.220
It is okay that you say this is too much.


00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.260
It's okay to be real.


00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.680
And even not only to God, let me just tell you this,


00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.720
it is okay to be real here in our church.


00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.540
Wanna know why?


00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.020
Because if you can't be real here,


00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.260
I don't know where else you can be real.


00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.320
This is a safe place to say, you know what, life sucks.


00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.580
Now, are we gonna sit there and say,


00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.700
hey, just wall around, yeah, just say,


00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.020
no, what we're gonna do is we're gonna wrap our arm


00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.760
around you and say, I'm so sorry that you're walking


00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.340
through this, that you're dealing with this.


00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:16.340
Man, let's pray and let's seek the God who cares.


00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:20.500
I think it's so important we see this.


00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.460
So as we continue on, this is the part where I'm gonna get


00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.600
a little bit, you know, doctor-ish, this is not my words,


00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.300
these are things that I've learned.


00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.980
And so we'll see here, Dr. Caroline Leaf said this,


00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.860
and I love this about prayer, she did a study,


00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.860
and you'll see this in your notes, that recently they found


00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.820
that 12 minutes of daily focused prayer


00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.740
over an eight week period can change the brain so much


00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.840
to an extent that it can be measured on a brain scan.


00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.560
What does that mean, right?


00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.880
Basically that means that not only does prayer


00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.060
touch God's heart, but prayer changes the chemistry


00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:53.900
of our brain.


00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.100
Prayer changes the chemistry of our brain.


00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.340
So when Jehoshaphat began to pray and focus on the Lord,


00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.700
it was transforming his mind to focus on God.


00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.580
I don't know about you guys,


00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.620
but whenever I begin to think on things that make me anxious,


00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.420
I go into a dark place at times.


00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.300
And that's where our minds go.


00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.300
But here's the cool part.


00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.260
When we understand that our brain can change,


00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.500
it means we don't have to stay there.


00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.020
We don't have to stay there.


00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.380
Because if we will focus on Jesus,


00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.660
that as we begin to do that, our minds,


00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.860
our brains begin to develop something different.


00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.220
And what will go into another big word, neuroplasticity.


00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.060
What does that mean?


00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.120
The more that we think on a thought,


00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.240
the more likely we are to think on that thought,


00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.200
and it's easier to do it.


00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.560
So just to give you a great example,


00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.040
if you continually say to yourself,


00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.400
"I'm not a good person, I'm always gonna fail,


00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.840
"I'm never good enough,"


00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.080
all these things negative, the more you think on those,


00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.640
the more you will think on them, it's easier to do.


00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.500
They're gonna come to mind a lot easier.


00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.560
So when we think about that idea,


00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.280
I've shared this quote with you before,


00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.280
our lives are heading in the direction


00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.200
of our strongest thoughts.


00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.880
So if our strongest thoughts are on the things


00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.440
that make us anxious, what do you expect


00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.280
that's going to happen, right?


00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.320
So when we understand there is a way for us


00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.420
to begin to overcome this, it is changing our mind.


00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.560
But again, I'm gonna use one more last big word


00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.240
and I'm done for the day, right?


00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.960
Anybody ever heard of the amygdala?


00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.860
Amygdala is a couple of people, right?


00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:19.960
We got a couple of people here.


00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.120
So this is almond-shaped thing in our brain.


00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.960
And what it's there for is, you know,


00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.320
imagine if you're out in the woods,


00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.240
because I'm never out in the woods, but if I was,


00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.080
there's some of y'all that love the woods,


00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.960
and you hear the big, you know, like growl out in the woods.


00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.800
You're not gonna think,


00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.560
"Oh, you know, that's probably just some thunder over there."


00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.520
You're probably thinking, "It's a bear."


00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.280
It's some kind of big animal that you're afraid of.


00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.460
And you know what your brain says?


00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.900
Run.


00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.800
Right, run, right.


00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.800
And so it's there to cause you to hear something and run


00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.880
and to focus on that and it's gonna cause you to move.


00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.560
But what ends up happening is,


00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.040
when this happens with anxiety,


00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.400
the things that cause anxiety,


00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.680
and we begin to flare up and we're thinking,


00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.400
Freak out, freak out, freak out.


00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.640
The problem is, is we begin to focus on the things


00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.200
that freak out on us over and over and over again.


00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.700
We're consumed with the alarm.


00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.240
We're consumed with what we are thinking on


00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.880
and we begin to be anxious.


00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.520
Okay, I lied, there's one more big word.


00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.680
One more big word.


00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.760
The word in the scripture most often translated


00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.200
as anxiety is this word that's listed in your notes


00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.360
that I can't hardly say, meronome.


00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.360
This is what it's really definition is dwelling


00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.500
or pondering on fearful or anxious thoughts,


00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.820
dwelling or pondering on fearful or anxious thoughts.


00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.460
Basically, we're training our brains to be anxious


00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.580
as we meditate on the negative,


00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.100
as we begin to think about it.


00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.220
So here's the question, how do we break the cycle?


00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.180
It sounds so simple, but we just pray.


00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.420
But prayer's not natural.


00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.700
You know what's natural?


00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.260
To think on the things that make us anxious.


00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.900
So prayer though, here's the cool part,


00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.740
prayer is supernatural.


00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.660
it supersedes the anxious thoughts.


00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.980
It supersedes it meaning this,


00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.980
that we need to continue to say,


00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.900
okay, prayer is how I overcome anxiety.


00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:05.900
How do I pray?


00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.540
I need to pray whatever the word of God says.


00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.820
I need to pray God's truth.


00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.340
How do I know God's truth?


00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.180
Is I get in the word?


00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.140
Or if I don't even know them and I can't get in the word,


00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.660
I call a friend who can be that for me,


00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.540
who can get in the word with me,


00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.600
who can pray together and seek the Lord with me.


00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.100
So we need to pray.


00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.460
And I love this, God has not given us a spirit of fear,


00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.220
but of power and love and sound mind.


00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.520
Typically when I quote that verse,


00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.880
it's in 2 Timothy I believe,


00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.420
I talk about power and love,


00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.100
but I always forget that sound mind.


00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.380
God has given us not a spirit of fear and anxiety,


00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.000
but of a sound mind.


00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.560
So again, prayer doesn't just touch the heart of God,


00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.560
it changes our brain.


00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.400
And we need to remember that anxiety is not a sin,


00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.860
it's a signal to do what?


00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.700
To seek the Lord.


00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.700
And I want us to read verse 12.


00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.380
I'm spending most of the time on this prayer part.


00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.020
Trust me, it's gonna go a little bit faster.


00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.740
So let's look at verse 12.


00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.820
Verse 12 says this, it says,


00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.880
"Our God, will you not judge them?


00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.360
"For we are powerless before this vast number


00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.080
"that comes to fight against us.


00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.920
"But we do not know what to do, but we look to you."


00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.560
We look to you.


00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.200
It's so important when we think about this


00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.640
that we look to God, right?


00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.400
It's okay to say we don't know what to do.


00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.080
It's okay to say this vast anxiety and everything in life


00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.920
from our financial issues to our health issues


00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.520
to just, I don't know what's going on with my body.


00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.160
it's okay to tell God you do not know what to do,


00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.440
but then to turn and say, but I trust in you.


00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.040
We were never, I'm just telling you,


00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.640
we were never designed to handle these anxious thoughts


00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.340
and all these things that cause our anxiety.


00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.080
We were never designed to handle that.


00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.800
God has always been the one that's designed to handle that


00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.960
because His Spirit lives inside of us.


00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.960
And when we don't have the Spirit of God inside of us,


00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.080
it's harder to handle.


00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.380
It's more difficult to handle


00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.440
and we'll continue to struggle with it.


00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.740
And so it's a challenge for all of us to remember this,


00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.540
If it's on God's mind, or so it's on your mind,


00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:56.380
it's on God's heart.


00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.380
If it's on your mind, if you're wrestling through it,


00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.240
it is on God's heart.


00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.240
So then, once we pray, then what do we do?


00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.320
If you're anything like me, when we pray,


00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.560
we immediately get up and we go do what we can


00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.460
to fix the problem.


00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.960
Anybody, I mean, anybody like me, okay, I pray.


00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.000
I'm good at praying.


00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.520
I pray and I get up and I just go.


00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.200
And it's that moment where it's like,


00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.260
God's going, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.480
You just asked me to move,


00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.960
but then you just took it all into your hands.


00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.000
I mean, I'm a doer.


00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.080
I love doing things.


00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.800
I love because I want control.


00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.900
So this is the important part.


00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.060
I wanna be as clear as I possibly can.


00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.700
When we pray, we need to do something else.


00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.520
And it's one of the hardest things,


00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.360
and we'll see it in here.


00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.840
One of the hardest things we do is to pause.


00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.240
Anxiety is a signal that it's time to pray


00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.860
and it's time to pause.


00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.860
That was awkward.


00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.860
I don't know about you guys.


00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.860
It's hard.


00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.860
There's the hardest part of seeking the Lord.


00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.860
It's the waiting.


00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.860
I'm just being real honest.


00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.860
Even as a pastor, I've been serving the Lord a long time,


00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.860
and we've sought the Lord a lot.


00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.860
And I'm just being honest.


00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.860
I'm just being honest.


00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.260
We've sought the Lord a long time,


00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.040
and we've sought the Lord a lot.


00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.340
I mean, I remember when Tegan was in the hospital


00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.340
and we sought the Lord and there was so much waiting.


00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.940
It's hard to wait.


00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.140
I'm just, I wanna be real.


00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.260
It's hard, so hard.


00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:34.880
But in the waiting, God shows up.


00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.580
God shows up, and this is what we're gonna see here.


00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.120
As we look at this, right, it says in verse 13


00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.620
that all of the people stood with their wives


00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.480
and their kids before the Lord.


00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.380
They didn't move.


00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:52.400
Psalm 46 10 says, "Be still and know that I am God."


00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.740
It sounds crazy.


00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.680
So when we pause,


00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.400
is that where God's gonna heal our anxiety?


00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.400
Here's what I'll tell you, maybe.


00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.960
In that moment, God may heal your anxiety immediately.


00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.600
But here's what it may be.


00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.640
Sometimes it's more of a process.


00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.600
It's a process.


00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.020
What's that process look like?


00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.000
It could be that he directs you to a Bible verse


00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.400
in the midst of that pausing.


00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.700
that gives you peace.


00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.340
It may be that he directs you to reach out to a friend


00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.780
because God has given us the body of Christ


00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.240
to bear one another's burdens.


00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.480
He may direct you in that pausing to seek help


00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.980
from a professional that knows how to help you


00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.740
walk through the mental and anxiety issues


00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.540
that you are dealing with, which is okay to ask for help.


00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.660
Right, asking for help is not a sign of weakness,


00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.420
it's a sign of strength and wisdom.


00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:42.540
He may lead you to do some of the most spiritual things,


00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.500
Sleeping and eating.


00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.040
In the midst of anxiety, I'll just tell you this,


00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.560
me and Brittany have talked about this lately.


00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.060
She'll tell me, "Honey, just go to sleep."


00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.020
Why?


00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.660
Because what we're talking about right now,


00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.780
you're just gonna continue to think negative.


00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.620
It's true.


00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.900
I mean, really, this happened like a couple days ago.


00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.340
Sometimes anxiety is just a result of we're exhausted.


00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.180
Just rest.


00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.080
Just be nourished, right?


00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.520
But sometimes it is a process, right?


00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.900
So what do we do, right?


00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.380
Overcoming God starts with,


00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.880
or overcoming anxiety starts with pursuing God


00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.580
the whole time.


00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:16.540
So what happened while they waited?


00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.540
We look at verses 15 and 17.


00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.020
Verses 15 says this, "And he said,


00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.740
"Listen carefully, all of Judah."


00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.540
And this is the guy that stood up in the midst of the group


00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.580
after they were waiting and pausing.


00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.620
It says, "The Lord said, 'Do not be afraid or discouraged


00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.120
"'because this vast number for the battle


00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:37.140
"'is not yours but God's.'"


00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.020
Not yours but God's.


00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.360
Let's look at verse 17.


00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.820
"You do not have to fight this battle.


00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.200
"Position yourselves and stand still


00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.740
"and see the salvation of the Lord.


00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.980
"He is with you.


00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.900
"Judah and Jerusalem, do not be afraid or discouraged.


00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.660
"Tomorrow, go out to face them,


00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.420
"for the Lord is with you."


00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.500
For the Lord is with you.


00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.260
So if you're struggling with anxiety,


00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.980
I want to tell you this today, this word is for you.


00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.540
The battle you're going through is not yours to fix.


00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.740
If you don't know what to do, you're in a good place.


00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.660
If you're struggling to figure out how to overcome it,


00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:12.000
you're in a good place because it is the Lord's battle


00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.960
to win.


00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.720
God loves you, he never leaves you nor forsakes you,


00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.000
even in the midst of your anxiety.


00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.960
So pausing allows God to work only the way that he can,


00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.340
right, only the way that he can, supernaturally.


00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.480
In my experience when pausing,


00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.200
what I believe has happened for me


00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.600
is that typically the Lord leads me to a verse.


00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.280
Typically the Lord leads me to reach out to a friend


00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.200
and say, "Hey, I'm struggling."


00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.240
And just so you know, this is me on the other side


00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.680
of learning some of these things,


00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.360
because I've been on the other side


00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:46.040
where I don't seek wisdom and I don't seek the Lord,


00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.660
and it is miserable.


00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.640
So this is me where I feel like God gives me either a song


00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.000
like I shared with you earlier,


00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.560
he'll remind me of his faithfulness in the past.


00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.200
And just mentioning my car, right?


00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.560
Whenever our car broke down,


00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.120
just wanna be real with you here.


00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.060
So my car's blowing that smoke out,


00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.320
and you know that that happened like the week after


00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.760
We booked a vacation as a family,


00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.000
and this is what I said, I think we're good,


00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
as long as one of our cars doesn't break down.


00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.280
I said that, we were sitting there,


00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.200
I'm like, ah, we should be good.


00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.300
And I mean, those are usually the moments


00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.920
that anxiety will come up,


00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.980
is when we wonder what are we going to do?


00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.720
But you know what the coolest part was?


00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.640
I had some of the most peace during that time.


00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.280
I was like, okay, we'll figure it out, that's okay.


00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.120
You know, and I've been taking that stance lately


00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:36.020
just because in the end worrying about it adds no value.


00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.420
It's fine, right, it's fine.


00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.300
And I share that to say, again,


00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.200
do I get that right every time?


00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.820
No, there's sometimes I'm freaking out, okay?


00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.140
But then again, I come back to the Lord.


00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.200
I come back to the Lord, and I just want you to know this.


00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.440
Whenever we realize everything we have,


00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.500
so let's just think about the things


00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.140
we can be anxious about, our finances, our marriage,


00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:58.340
our kids, our, you name it, right?


00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.020
Relationships, jobs, all the things


00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.980
that we could be anxious about.


00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.760
If you will lay them down at his feet,


00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.580
they're his, they're his to fix.


00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.820
So if it's your car, it's his to fix.


00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.400
If it's your marriage, it's his to restore.


00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.200
If it's your job, it's his to provide.


00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.780
You name it, it's his.


00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.620
I remember my pastor teaching me this.


00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.940
Whenever he would preach, he would remind us


00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.260
that if you give over to the Lord, it's his.


00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.900
So then you go to him to fix it.


00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.220
You don't have to fix it.


00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.400
Now does that mean you don't have to do anything?


00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.640
you're just gonna be stubborn on the other side,


00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.120
it's like, well, I'm just gonna sit over here.


00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.080
No, you pause and you listen for the Lord


00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.740
to lead you to the next thing.


00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.960
And it's amazing how God shows up every single time.


00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.280
So I don't know if I'm speaking to you


00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.100
if you've struggled with that,


00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.840
but I pray that this is speaking to you.


00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.480
So as we're kinda heading down to the conclusion here,


00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.460
we need to remember again, anxiety is not a sin,


00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.720
it's a signal telling us it's time to pray,


00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.960
it's time to pause, and the last one is one of my favorite,


00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.560
it's time to praise, it's time to praise.


00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.700
So if we see here in verses 18 and following,


00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.060
I think I'm on here, 18,


00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:09.300
it says then, we see this in the beginning,


00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.840
then Jehoshaphat knelt low with his face to the ground


00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.740
and all of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem


00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.700
fell down before the Lord and worshiped him.


00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:20.100
What I love about this picture is they begin to praise


00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.400
before the battle was won.


00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:26.620
Praising doesn't just start when he's defeated our anxiety,


00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.360
praising started beforehand.


00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.460
They believed the Lord and it was counted to him


00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.300
as righteousness.


00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.320
Think about that back to Abraham as well.


00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.900
So they prayed and they believed that God


00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.240
was going to show up.


00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.600
They paused and they waited on the Lord to respond


00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.940
and he did and they praised.


00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.960
Let's look at verses 21 and 22.


00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.920
It says, "Then they consulted with the people


00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.640
"and appointed some to sing for the Lord


00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.720
"and some to praise splendor of his holiness.


00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.580
"And when they went out in the front of the armed forces,


00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.300
"they kept singing, 'Give thanks to the Lord


00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.520
"'for his faithful love endures forever.'


00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.880
And the moment they begin their shouts and praises,


00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.440
the Lord set an ambush against the Amunites, the Moabites,


00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.560
and the inhabitants of Mount Seir,


00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.980
who came to fight against Judah, and they were defeated.


00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.360
I want you to think through this.


00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.320
It says that they put the praise team


00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.840
out in front of the army.


00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.320
I really started kind of laughing.


00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.240
I was starting to imagine Matt and Amanda


00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.040
and the rest of the team that plays on Sunday


00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.500
just standing out in front of the army,


00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.760
and I'm just like, go kill 'em.


00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.060
(audience laughing)


00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:28.900
Stick 'em.


00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.400
We're gonna hang back here, okay?


00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.440
But like, that sounds crazy.


00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.180
I mean, not to me, 'cause I'm glad you guys are out front,


00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.920
but like, that sounds crazy, right?


00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:43.420
But God does things that are supernatural.


00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.600
That's the part.


00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.280
I think when we think I can't overcome my anxiety,


00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.620
I'm serious, when we think we can't overcome our anxiety,


00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.460
we're thinking in our terms.


00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.500
There's no way.


00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.820
I've tried it before.


00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.860
I've been walking through this for 10, 15, 20 years.


00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:57.740
There's no way.


00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.660
That's exactly what we think.


00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.580
I've been there.


00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.300
We think God cannot change the situation.


00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.900
I've done this, this has happened.


00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.060
It never changes, it never changes, it never changes.


00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.100
But God is supernatural.


00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.820
He works way above our mind, right?


00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.140
His perspective is not limited, ours is.


00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:19.020
And so he sends this praise team out to praise the Lord.


00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.980
The moment that they begin praising, the battle was won.


00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.540
So God did a miracle, right?


00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.140
In verse 24, we see this,


00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.820
"When Judah came to the place to overlook the wilderness,


00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.400
they saw this large army,


00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.380
but there were just corpses laying on the ground


00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.420
and nobody had escaped."


00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.280
And I know I don't have time to dive off into this


00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.180
because it sounds very brutal and grueling.


00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.900
And that's another topic for another day.


00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.560
But I would say those were the enemies


00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.420
that they were asking God to defeat.


00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:47.500
And God defeated them before they ever got there, right?


00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.680
I think it's amazing what we see here.


00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.860
So we're gonna head into invitation.


00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.220
We're jumping right into invitation.


00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.700
Why are we jumping into invitation?


00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:04.700
Because I think God wants to do some battle for you.


00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:09.020
We have prayed and we've talked about prayer.


00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.540
We have talked about pausing.


00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.180
We've talked about praising.


00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:18.180
And just so you know, I sit in your seat every week.


00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.480
Sounds weird.


00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.020
preparing a message each week,


00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.280
I sit in your seat every week and I write a message


00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.780
and I pray over a message and God brings about a message


00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.220
and we look at these things and I'm like,


00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.000
oh, this is awesome.


00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
But if it doesn't go from here to here, it doesn't matter.


00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.820
And here's, again, I'm just gonna be honest with you.


00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:46.560
Every week that we do invitation,


00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.540
I sense at times we don't know what to do.


00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.060
We don't know how to go from here to here.


00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.300
I think we think, great message,


00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.680
but how does it transform our hearts and minds?


00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:00.020
I want us to do battle with the Lord.


00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:03.020
And this is what I wanna read with you,


00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.300
verses 29 and 30.


00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.060
I'm gonna start with 29 just to kinda lead us to this.


00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.200
29 says, "The terror of God was on all of the kingdoms


00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.760
"of the land when they heard that the Lord had fought


00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.180
"against the enemies of Israel."


00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.260
I'm gonna start right there.


00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.260
"The fear of the Lord came on every other one


00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.580
of the kingdoms around them.


00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.140
Let me just, I wanna communicate this.


00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:27.660
Our struggles are not against flesh and blood,


00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.500
but against rulers and against authorities


00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.820
and cosmic powers, which means this,


00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.100
we have an enemy that wants to make you think


00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.700
that you cannot overcome your anxiety.


00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.420
But I love this verse.


00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.260
Here's the translation of it.


00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.300
When God wins the battle for you,


00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:46.980
you were telling all the enemies around you,


00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.420
you are not welcome here,


00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.520
because my God fights my battles.


00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.720
My God fights my battles.


00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.320
Enemy, you're not welcome here.


00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.720
I shared with the family this week


00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.300
as I was talking to them on the phone,


00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.460
you need to pray over your home.


00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.220
You need to pray over your marriage.


00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.500
You need to pray over your kids.


00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.820
The enemy is not welcome here


00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.360
because the Lord fights my battles.


00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.740
We need to be praying that.


00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.780
We need to be praying that.


00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.440
And then we look at verse 30, and it says this,


00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.000
then Jehoshaphat and the kingdom was quiet,


00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.820
for his God gave him rest.


00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:16.660
Let's translate that.


00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.680
God gave him peace on every side.


00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:25.800
He provides perfect peace.


00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.480
Again, perfect peace is found not in the absence of trials,


00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.920
but on the presence of God,


00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.880
fighting your battles for you every single week.


00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.840
I remind you of that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,


00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.480
'cause again, I jumped down on my notes,


00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:42.480
but remember their faith to jump into that fire


00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.440
knowing whether they were saved or not,


00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.040
and Jesus showed up.


00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.640
You want Jesus to show up for you today?


00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.840
He will, He will.


00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.780
So the question is, hey, I'm preaching these messages


00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.320
out of experience, right?


00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.040
I'm not preaching from, I don't know what anxiety is like,


00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.720
I'm preaching them from I do know what anxiety is like.


00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.860
So you may ask, or should been,


00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:09.860
is your anxiety cured because you prayed, paused and praised?


00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.100
Yeah.


00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.080
Here's what I would tell you.


00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.520
I've won a lot of battles.


00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.560
The Lord has won a lot of battles for me


00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.000
because I've done just that.


00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.440
But here's what I'll just tell you


00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.720
because we live in a broken world


00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.500
where we will have trials and struggles


00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.600
through the rest of our lives, sad but true.


00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.840
Anxiety is right around the corner.


00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.440
Here's what I will tell you,


00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.560
that when anxiety shows back up, we have a battle plan.


00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.880
So you may not be dealing with anxiety right now,


00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.320
but you will.


00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:46.400
And if you do, don't think on it.


00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.760
Give it to God, give it to God, give it to God.


00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.040
What does it look like to have Jesus


00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.080
in the midst of our anxieties?


00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.600
Jesus reminds us it's not our battle, it's his,


00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.920
because the battle belongs to him.


00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.000
Jesus reminds us that he has done it before


00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.600
and he will do it again, and if he's never done it for you,


00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.160
he can do it for you now.


00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.600
Because we see it in his word,


00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.080
and we see it in the lives of those around us


00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.840
that God can win this battle.


00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.420
(gentle music)


00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.160
I'm reminded that everything I could be anxious about,


00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.360
everything you could be anxious about,


00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.520
God is in control of.


00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.220
Our battles are not against flesh and blood,


00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.320
but against these powers and only Jesus can defeat them.


00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.840
So I'm gonna pray for us.


00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.040
We're gonna, I'm gonna walk you through praying,


00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.660
pausing and praising during the sum of invitation.


00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:35.160
So Lord Jesus, as we lead into invitation, Lord,


00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.420
open our hearts and minds, Lord,


00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.600
to what you are going to lead us to do


00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.860
in this time of praying, pausing and praising.


00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.600
So as we continue to pray, this is what I want you to do.


00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.540
I want you to just begin to pray and think about the things


00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.880
in which you are anxious about.


00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.080
And I don't want you to dwell on those,


00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.820
but I want you to bring them to your mind


00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.120
because those are the ways that you're gonna be able


00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.960
to lay them down at Jesus's feet.


00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.840
So right where you are,


00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.600
I'm challenging you to begin to just lay them down.


00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.600
Say, Jesus, you can have my anxious thoughts


00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.400
towards my finances.


00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.680
Jesus, you can have my anxious thoughts


00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:10.040
towards my broken family or my marriage that's struggling.


00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:14.440
Jesus, you can have my anxiety towards my job


00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.620
or my sickness.


00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.200
You can have my anxiety towards this


00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.880
exhausted feeling that I have.


00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.400
Lay them down at Jesus' feet right now.


00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.840
I'm praying that you lay them down right now.


00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.720
Begin to say Jesus, they're yours.


00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.300
(gentle music)


00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.880
(gentle music)


00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:48.900
Lord Jesus, I'm praying for every person in this room, Lord,


00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.380
that deals with anxiety.


00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.720
God, you care.


00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.500
God, I pray that your presence


00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:59.300
is showing up in their lives right now.


00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.980
God, I'm praying.


00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:06.980
that they are laying down their cares before you


00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.060
because you care for them.


00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:13.700
Lord, remind them how powerful you are,


00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.900
how you can pick those up, put them on the cross,


00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.380
and you died for them.


00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.660
You died for those cares.


00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:22.900
Lord, meet them where they're at.


00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.980
I want you to just take some time now


00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.620
after you've laid them down, and I just want you to pause.


00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.340
Pausing's so difficult.


00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.380
So we're just gonna pause, take a minute or two,


00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:38.180
and we're just gonna rest and just listen for the Lord


00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:41.540
in some way, either through reminding part of the sermon


00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:45.260
or Lord, maybe it's somehow they're just gonna remember


00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.580
a scripture, Lord, you're gonna do something


00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:51.180
in this time of pausing, so let's just pause


00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.940
and rest in the Lord.


00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.520

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.940

(gentle music)


00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.540
So here's what I want you to do now.


00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.040
This is gonna be the hard part.


00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.620
I want you to begin to just sit right where you're at


00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.140
and I want you to just give praise to the Lord.


00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.540
Tell him thank you.


00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.500
Say thank you, Lord, even though I can't see it,


00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:07.340
you're working.


00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.180
Lord, I want you to just sit right there.


00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.300
I want you to all just sit right there and just say,


00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:16.180
Lord, thank you for your word.


00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:20.380
Again, you're maybe praising in faith and saying thank you,


00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.780
even though you can't see that he has overcome your anxiety,


00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.260
I want you to begin to praise him right now


00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.160
and say thank you.


00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.780
Say thank you, Lord, for dying on the cross for us


00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.740
so that we could experience salvation


00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.580
and renewing of our hearts and minds.


00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:36.100
Just begin to thank him for who he is


00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.460
and what he's done for you.


00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:44.460

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:54.040
(gentle music)


00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.120
last thing that I want to encourage you with,


00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.600
and maybe this is what I should have started with,


00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.120
there's no promise that every person


00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.200
that walked into this room has given their life to Jesus.


00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.620
And the reason why I say that is because


00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:33.840
if you don't know Jesus,


00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.760
you've never given your life to Jesus,


00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.400
you may not even know how to pray and how to pause


00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.360
and how to praise because you haven't experienced


00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.960
this transforming, saving faith in your life.


00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.120
And so I just wanna challenge you today,


00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.080
if you need to give your life to Jesus,


00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.680
that you can do it now.


00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.100
How do you give your life to Jesus?


00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.340
It's simple, through faith.


00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.940
By asking God to come into your life and save you.


00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.200
To ask God to forgive you of your sins.


00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.220
To ask God to transform your life.


00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.080
To come in and to lead you.


00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.140
And so I just wanna challenge you where you are.


00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:11.660
I ask this every week.


00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.020
If you wanna give your life to Jesus,


00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.940
if you came in this room and you don't know Jesus,


00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.940
but yet you wanna leave experience


00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:17.780
and relationship with Jesus,


00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:18.780
I just want you to raise your hand


00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.020
'cause I wanna pray for you,


00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:21.140
I wanna pray with you,


00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.780
and I wanna encourage you where you're at.


00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.680
And so if there's anybody in this room


00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.260
that needs to give their lives to Jesus,


00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.440
just raise your hand.


00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.600
We're here to encourage you in your faith.


00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:35.980
Okay.


00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:40.040
So as we continue with invitation, this is the last thing.


00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:40.940
We're gonna stand up


00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.780
and we're gonna corporately praise together.


00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.780
I think most of our battles that we'll win


00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.780
will be when we link arms to praise.


00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:53.780
Here's what I know, is that God is here to fight for you.


00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:57.740
He's always been here to fight for you,


00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:59.140
but maybe today you need to be reminded


00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:02.140
that God is here to fight your battles.


00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.500
Maybe it's anxiety, maybe you just need to fill in the blank,


00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.460
whatever it is.


00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:11.580
Let's praise today in advance for God to win the battles.


00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:15.140
We fight our battles on our knees.


00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.020
So let's worship together,


00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:18.940
Let's stand together and praise God


00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.440
during this time of imitation.


00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.840
