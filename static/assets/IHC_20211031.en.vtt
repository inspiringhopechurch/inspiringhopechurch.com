00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.830
This, why does God chase after us?

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.450
Why does God pursue us?

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.680
Why did God pursued Jonah?

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.750
Because the more people that God tax
that he gets ahold of that get ahold

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.610
of who God is, the bigger that group
gets the sharks and I'm, so that

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.080
sharks sounds really bad as a follower.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.640
So don't miss this.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.850
Okay.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.080
I'm trying to bring it around here.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.990
As God continues to use that as
God continues to grow the church.

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:33.945
Brings us in, you know, what, what
I found on Tuesday, it was easier to

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:39.045
get the other people because we worked
together at one moment, we strategize,

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:42.315
I pulled the kids together and I
said, guys, we're going to get mad

00:00:42.555 --> 00:00:44.745
because Matt was playing all of us.

00:00:44.805 --> 00:00:46.275
Whenever we say go we're all.

00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:46.965
Well, there was eight of us.

00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:48.495
We're going to run towards Matt and Matt.

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:49.394
Won't be able to get missed.

00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:50.175
And that's what happened.

00:00:50.325 --> 00:00:51.045
It happened quick.

00:00:51.045 --> 00:00:51.345
Didn't it?

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:53.315
It was.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.740
Yes, it was over quick.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.190
Yes.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.790
So I want to encourage you in this
idea of why does God pursue you?

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.519
Why did God pursued Jonah?

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.879
The one, whatever.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.700
There was 120,000 people that
just got done giving their lives

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.820
to Christ or given the lives to
God are repenting in this book.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.190
And I'm going to catch you up if you're
wondering where round my catch you up.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.470
Why did God go after the one Jonah?

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.259
Because God cared about the
one, you know, it talks about,

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.430
he leaves the 99 to go to the.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.729
God pursues us because he wants us to
be a part of helping pursue other people

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.360
to discover God's purpose for their
life through relationship with Jesus.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.789
See, I think that's so-called
that God cares about you.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.119
He hears about me so much that
he's going to pursue us to be

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.190
a part of God's ultimate plan.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.750
And when we work together as a church,
it's easier to reach other people, right.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.280
Because we're a team and we can do that.

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:44.865
So I asked that idea behind,
have you ever played tag?

00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:47.055
And so I'm going to challenge
you in this and, and just, you

00:01:47.055 --> 00:01:47.985
can consider this in your heart.

00:01:47.985 --> 00:01:49.185
Have you ever ran from something?

00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:51.675
Maybe it's a relationship,
maybe it was a job.

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:56.165
Maybe it was a call, um, on your
life that God had given you maybe.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.280
So this story today will speak to you.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.550
Right?

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.390
So as the story of Jonah is really a
picture of a man who was a prophet, right.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.549
A prophet, someone who had received the
word of God directly, but yet he ran.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.650
And so maybe you've ran
from something in your life.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.490
You've regretted it.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.990
Maybe currently you're running from.

00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:16.655
You'll relate with Jonah today.

00:02:16.684 --> 00:02:20.285
You'll relate with him, but we have a
choice to make that maybe he didn't make.

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:24.304
And so I think it's interesting how tragic
tragic it is to see a prophet of God

00:02:24.304 --> 00:02:26.584
Jonah run from the Lord and continually.

00:02:27.255 --> 00:02:30.915
But I think it's even more tragic as
today, as we see children of God run

00:02:30.915 --> 00:02:34.994
from the Lord and it's because God has
something better for us yet we run.

00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:35.325
Right.

00:02:35.984 --> 00:02:37.515
Um, and so let me kind of catch you up.

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:39.945
I'm going to kind of walk through
these chapters, try to be quick so

00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:44.054
we can jump in and dive into the
text today in Jonah chapter four, but

00:02:44.084 --> 00:02:46.994
chapter one, Jonah, what does God say?

00:02:46.994 --> 00:02:48.855
God says, go and Jonah says, whoa.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.030
No, I'm not going right.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.650
So he runs to tortious, gets down
into a boat, falls asleep, a storm

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.940
comes the sailors, basically say, Hey,
Jonah, call out to your God, Jonah

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.570
doesn't um, they say, Hey, who's the
one that's causing this storm, Jonah.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.230
Doesn't fess up.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.549
Finally, they cast lots.

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.340
They figure out it's Jonah and
Jonah says, throw me off the ship.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.329
And they say, Hey, wait, let's try
to wrote a shore to save your life.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.470
And they tried, it didn't work.

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.440
So they ask God, please, God
don't count this against us.

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:17.670
They threw Jonah off the boat.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.090
And God calm the storm.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.330
And I want to read this, this first two
in Jonah chapter one, it says this in

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.200
verse 16, John chapter one, and the men
were seized by great fear of the Lord.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.960
And they offered a sacrifice
to the Lord and may vows.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.540
So the first group to turn
to the Lord was not Jonah.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.410
It was the people.

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:36.105
It was the men on the boat.

00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:39.405
So now we see chapter two, some
deep sea diving is what I would

00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:40.935
say, deep sea diving from Jonah.

00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:45.615
So he goes down so deep in the ocean that
he gets into the belly of a fish, right?

00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:48.015
God, uh, points that fish
to, to put them there.

00:03:48.015 --> 00:03:51.375
And so Jonah spins three days and
three nights in this belly, right?

00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:52.275
Why does God do that?

00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:54.105
Because God is trying to
get Jonah's attention.

00:03:54.585 --> 00:03:56.835
So finally, what we believe
is we begin to study this.

00:03:56.835 --> 00:03:59.775
It's probably the end of the third
day that Jonah finally gets desperate

00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:00.855
enough to say, Hey, I don't like.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.640
Experiencing here in the belly I want out.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.380
And so here's what he says in
chapter two, verse seven, he says,

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.720
that's, my life was fading away.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.050
I remembered the Lord and my prayer
came to you to your holy temple.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.710
So this, this moment where Joan was like,
okay, I'm done living in this belly.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.580
I want to go.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.220
Or whatever it is that you need to do to.

00:04:18.914 --> 00:04:21.224
Use me I'm going to,
uh, I'm going to do it.

00:04:21.224 --> 00:04:25.455
So he, he is obviously the Lord
vomits him out on the ocean, out on

00:04:25.455 --> 00:04:27.765
the sea or shore, whatever it is.

00:04:28.155 --> 00:04:32.685
Uh, and basically we see the end of
verse, um, our chapter two in that way.

00:04:33.044 --> 00:04:35.174
So now what happens chapter
three, here's the one of my

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.495
favorite chapters of the book.

00:04:36.794 --> 00:04:38.594
What I call obedience and human.

00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:40.544
Leads to life change.

00:04:40.844 --> 00:04:41.925
So we see Jonah, right?

00:04:41.925 --> 00:04:42.675
God says, go.

00:04:42.675 --> 00:04:45.224
And Jonah went, Jonah went
with the message of the Lord.

00:04:45.224 --> 00:04:47.655
And a lot of times Joanie gets
criticized for his short message

00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:48.854
that he spoke to Nineveh.

00:04:49.604 --> 00:04:50.805
Um, here's what I would say.

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:53.235
It says, Jonah spoke the
word that the Lord gave him.

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:56.385
So I'm going to stop there and say,
Hey, Jonah did what God told him to do.

00:04:56.385 --> 00:04:59.865
In most likely God told him that
short sentence, because he didn't

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:03.914
want Jonah to get the glory for
his ability to speak elegantly.

00:05:04.215 --> 00:05:07.664
He wanted to use God's
power right through Jonah.

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:08.175
And so.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.860
Jonas spoke and the people of Nineveh
respondent, there was 120,000 people in

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.620
Nineveh that were not honoring the Lord.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.560
And so, you know, kind of, kind
of bring this, these people

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.180
in Nineveh were Jonah's enemy.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.940
They were people who
persecuted Jonah's people.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.590
And so Jonah hated them.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.940
Joni didn't like them.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.540
Joanie didn't want to.

00:05:28.515 --> 00:05:31.965
To Nineveh to see them repent, but
they did repent over this message.

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:36.105
And one of the interesting parts about it
is the king of Nineveh led out the charge.

00:05:36.315 --> 00:05:37.365
He stepped down from his throne.

00:05:37.365 --> 00:05:40.455
He took off his Royal robes and he
put on sackcloth and ashes to show

00:05:40.455 --> 00:05:42.045
his true repentance in his heart.

00:05:42.405 --> 00:05:47.115
He then set a to, for the whole,
uh, nation of Nineveh and they

00:05:47.115 --> 00:05:51.225
followed suit and he says, Hey, seek
out to the Lord, repent and turn.

00:05:51.465 --> 00:05:52.695
And maybe the Lord will.

00:05:53.475 --> 00:05:56.475
I love this idea guys, there's times
where we're going to desperately seek

00:05:56.475 --> 00:05:58.695
the Lord, but we don't truly know.

00:05:59.535 --> 00:05:59.805
Okay.

00:05:59.835 --> 00:06:02.925
We do, we do truly know the Lord will
forgive us, but they didn't truly

00:06:02.925 --> 00:06:04.365
know that the Lord would forgive them.

00:06:04.785 --> 00:06:08.715
And this is the interesting part that we
see with God in verse 10 of chapter three,

00:06:08.715 --> 00:06:12.255
it says, and God saw their actions that
they had turned from their evil ways.

00:06:12.255 --> 00:06:14.655
And so God relented from the
disaster that he had threatened

00:06:14.655 --> 00:06:16.005
him and he did not do it.

00:06:16.005 --> 00:06:19.965
So God had said he was going to destroy
Nineveh if they did not repent, but.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.480
At this moment, the book should have
ended and here's how it should have ended.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.130
And Jonah celebrated.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.080
And so did the Lord and the people
continue to live out their lives for God.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.450
That's how the story should
have ended, but it didn't.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.800
And this is where chapter four comes in.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.390
Chapter four is an interesting one.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.080
This is where we see Jonas
mad, but God is compassionate.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.740
Jonah's mad.

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:42.794
But God is compassionate.

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:47.055
And we're going to read through all
these verses, um, where we see kind of

00:06:47.055 --> 00:06:48.794
the, the full picture of Jonah's story.

00:06:48.794 --> 00:06:51.465
If you weren't here a couple of weeks
ago, when we read and study through

00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:53.895
the first four verses of Jonah, I
want to bring everybody up to pace

00:06:53.895 --> 00:06:55.484
on this, but I want to mention this.

00:06:55.484 --> 00:06:56.385
This idea is.

00:06:57.165 --> 00:07:01.005
Jonah is basically mad at the people
repented and that God was gracious.

00:07:01.515 --> 00:07:04.725
And verse two says this, it
says chapter four says, I knew

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:05.745
that you are a gracious and
