00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.800
life because god has designed the body of 
christ the body of believers to work together um  

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.440
and so i actually thought of this this 
week and so riley's not in here so i can  

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.920
talk about her so riley i was one 
that did um our uh announcements  

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.200
and so she moved up here from oklahoma with us 
um about a year ago so whenever she moved up  

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.160
she got to share her story with the mission team 
this week and one of the things i heard in riley's  

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.040
statements was not just words of faith but actions 
of faith see i always make this statement riley  

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.360
was in on coming to cincinnati before i really 
realized what it meant to be in to plant a church  

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.160
here in cincinnati and so the cool part with that 
is she had already taken action steps she was in  

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.640
and over and over again what she 
would see physically with her eyes was  

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.400
she thought she would have a job before she moved 
here she thought she would have a house secured  

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.320
before she moved here and none of that happened 
but that didn't stop her from taking faith steps  

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.280
because she believed that god had called her 
to come and the cool part is it it didn't  

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.560
happen immediately but over time god began to 
open doors see there's a lot of those stories  

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.480
even within this church over the last year and a 
half that we've seen people take steps of faith  

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.200
because they know that god is going to win 
the battle that god has a plan for their life  

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.600
even say this riley would even say this that 
all of us have linked arms to accomplish  

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.840
and to win the battles in our life to be 
able to push forward with faith they had  

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.560
the faith but they didn't do it alone again 
that shield was linked with somebody else and  

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.960
we pushed forward and we saw victory and 
we celebrated and gave god glory for that  

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.800
i'll tell you this the shield of faith means 
so much to me because to plant a church it  

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.040
takes a lot of faith and it's not just a lot of 
faith of words but it's a lot of faith of action  

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.480
and if i had to do this alone i would make it but 
god never designed for me to do it alone it's not  

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.520
just about me it's really about the body the group 
of believers people that want to partner with us  

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.120
to do this and so i always talk about the mission 
team they're from o'fallon missouri but they came  

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.720
all the way to ohio missouri and if they didn't 
come what would we been able to do this week for  

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.960
vacation bible school i think we would have done 
a decent job but man they linked arms with us and  

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.680
they did an amazing job and so i thank you so 
much for doing that for taking faith right to  

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.480
come all the way here and spend a week with us i 
mean that took faith in action right but thank you  

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.480
um so i just i would say this hey yes yes let's 
clap thank you yes um but then i think about this  

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.960
so the reason why we don't move forward a lot 
of times with our faith so we'll say i want to  

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.080
have faith anybody ever remember the scripture 
where the the father says um uh it says hey  

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.960
believe and he says help my unbelief there's 
those moments we have this crisis of faith  

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.280
and it's a reminder that the opposite of faith 
is what does anybody know opposite of faith fear  

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.040
the opposite of faith is fear so we've been 
learning all week in vacation bible school  

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.200
that god's word is truth see john 17 17 says 
god's word is truth and so whenever i think about  

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.960
um man am i supposed to have fear 
in my life as a follower of jesus  

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.680
and really second timothy 1 7 says this it says 
for god has not given us a spirit of fear but of  

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.520
power and of love and of sound mind see i think so 
many times we talk about all that god's given us  

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.480
but there's times we need to write down what god 
hasn't given us god has not given you a spirit of  

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.520
fear which means the opposite god has given you 
a spirit of faith not in yourself not in your own  

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.240
abilities but in his and his call in your life 
and the only way that you'll really discover  

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.120
what that is and how to have that faith is through 
a personal relationship with jesus spending time  

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.640
in his word and i i admit this every single time 
when you jump into god's word especially as a new  

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.160
believer or maybe you're not even a new believer 
and you're still just figuring this thing out  

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.280
it gets confusing at times but this is where 
we link shields and we sit down together  

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.400
i've been doing that with uh joe and kristen it's 
just let's walk through scripture together and  

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.320
help one another discover the faith that we need 
to have right discover god's purpose for our lives  

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.840
so i just i encourage you this the shield of 
faith pick it up in every situation link those  

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.600
shields together right so true faith is not just 
talking but it's actually testing and see that god  

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.200
has proven to come through and provide for us and 
so just think through that as we continue through  

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.640
this is there ever a time where maybe you have 
lacked faith and i'll even challenge you with  

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.280
this is maybe there's someone waiting on you 
on the other side of you taking a step of faith  

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.840
because a lot of times we think individual with 
this right faith is just all about me and it's  

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.160
going to help me but really faith taking those 
faith steps is going to impact someone else's life  

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.240
so i challenge you to consider that right so 
then we we're going to continue on this right so  

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.520
we have the shield of faith but then we have the 
helmet of salvation and it says this all kind of  

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.920
read it here it says take the helmet of salvation 
the sword of the spirit which is the word of god  

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.200
so we think about a helmet it covers our head 
what's in our our head is our brain our mind and  

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:25.600
so we know this the enemy tries to deceive us 
by controlling our thoughts anybody ever had a  

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.600
negative thought towards yourself self-defeating 
right just so you know that's not of god  

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.280
that is of the enemy uh and so if you've ever 
dealt with out right that's the enemy trying  

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.280
to scheme or to deceive you into thinking that 
you're not good enough you can't be forgiven  

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.160
you know there you name it you all know it i don't 
have to have you say it out loud right but we i  

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.400
think about this and this is the interesting part 
right we have the ability to put on this helmet  

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.520
which protects us from the enemy doing that and 
it says it's the word of god but i think about  

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.080
this anybody ever play that game with other kids 
where you would trick some of the other kids into  

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.560
you could reach people's minds and and this is how 
we would do it we'd sit about five or six friends  

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.640
together two friends would be in on it the one 
reading the minds and the other one that would  

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.000
help you figure it out they would turn around 
figure out a number it could be 27 it could be 10.  

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.840
they'd figure it out okay it's 10. i'd 
sit there and just think close my eyes  

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.600
meditate whatever you want to think and i would go 
up and just put my hands on their head because i  

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.320
can read their minds right but really it was just 
clenching our jaws the number that was there right  

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.960
so that's sometimes what we think is like okay 
well the enemy has full access to my head and  

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.560
and he can read my mind and all this well 
absolutely you know he could if we don't  

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.200
put on a helmet right he can deceive us and 
get into our minds and and do that but he he  

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.000
can't if we put on our helmets and so i'm 
trying to build this case in this idea of  

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.400
you know we we have the ability to fight 
our battles from the place of victory  

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:00.880
but it's not because of lack of god's side it's 
lack of our side of putting on the armor of god  

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.800
to win the victory right that's where i think 
the miscommunication is is well if i'm a believer  

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.240
everything's gonna be perfect absolutely 
not read the bible i mean believers had  

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.120
horrible things happen to them but we do know 
that god has the ability to win every single  

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.840
one of those battles no matter what happens to 
them because they put on that full armor of god  

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.360
so whenever god controls the mind right the enemy 
has no ability to um control the mind and i think  

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.800
that's so important for the believer right the 
word of god is so important to defeat the enemy  

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.360
in that so when we think about this helmet of 
salvation salvation has two pieces to it the first  

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.080
one is one salvation refers to saving someone from 
something right so we i think all get that idea  

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:50.960
of being saved from our sins when god sent jesus 
to die on the cross for us he saved us from  

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:57.120
our sins when we repent and believe in that but 
there's another aspect that i think we miss living  

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:04.640
in too often the other side of the salvation is 
really freedom freedom is another word for victory  

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:11.920
see when we have put on the helmet of salvation 
we are freed from our sins we are freed from the  

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:18.240
enemy's ability to deceive our minds and we need 
to live in that confidence and the only way we'll  

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:26.000
live in that confidence is if we continually renew 
our mind daily with the truth with the truth um  

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:32.960
and so this is one of the things that ties 
following jesus if you you'll hear what do  

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.760
we talk about the most especially in our small 
groups um is get in the word follow jesus that's  

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.680
the number one thing we want to teach people to 
do follow jesus that means spending time in his  

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:47.280
word and putting in that helmet of salvation and 
understanding that god's truth will reign through  

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.480
anything that the enemy wants to deceive us and 
i'll just encourage you with this if you're ever  

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.600
struggling with maybe winning the war in your mind 
there is a pastor that wrote this book winning  

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.800
the war in your mind named craig groeschel i 
read that book in a season when i needed it  

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.680
i needed to be reminded of biblical truths that 
i could repeat over and over again that would  

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:12.560
help me overcome the enemy's attacks and so just 
know this you're not alone if you deal with that  

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.320
there's a lot of us that deal with that we just 
want to admit it but let's go back to the shield  

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.000
of faith let's link arms together and help one 
another overcome that in our lives and so we need  

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.080
to remind ourselves of these things right so if 
god's word is the way that we overcome the enemy's  

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:34.800
deceiving tactics ephesians 1 3-17 remind us of 
these thoughts right we need to say this over our  

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.840
lives we are blessed we are chosen we are holy and 
blameless and redeemed and adopted and forgiven  

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.120
and these are things that we need to 
remind ourselves that god loves us  

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.400
he desires to have a relationship with you 
he's overcome all these things so don't let  

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:57.520
the enemy win so then the last is the sword of 
the spirit the sword of the spirit talks about  

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.960
um a couple of things one is when i think of 
a sword i think of a huge sword and this could  

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.480
be an answer what paul was mentioning but most 
believe that paul was talking about the sword  

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.360
which would be a double-edged sword it would be 
a small sword that you would use in close combat  

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.160
so this idea of paul mentioning this sword rather 
than a longer sword that you might not be as close  

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:25.440
makes you think about this that we fight 
our enemies at close range so the enemy's  

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.200
not way over there and like we're just kind of 
like looking at them but we are in close range  

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.480
every single day with our enemy and so this sword 
is so important because it's our offensive weapon  

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.040
right we really don't just again defend 
ourselves but we go into action to defeat  

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.000
our enemy and i know this as a kid i loved playing 
with a sword and one of my favorite things was to  

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.320
do is end the sword fight with getting stabbed 
with it on the side you guys know that on the  

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.480
side and falling over and i lost but it was 
just fun but sorry that's just a side note  

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.240
but i just when i think of a sword like i think 
of all the fun i used to have with the sword so  

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.840
take the sword of the spirit run with it let's 
have fun okay that's what god's telling us  

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:07.600
um but it is an offensive weapon right and 
so we we are a lot of times playing defense  

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.400
as a believer and so let me give you an 
example sometimes we come to faith in christ  

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.440
and we go okay i've made it all i got to 
do is get to heaven heaven get here quick  

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.320
and that here's the thing i want to see heaven 
i want to see jesus i don't want to deal with  

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:31.600
pain and suffering any more than i have to but if 
you're still breathing today and i'm guessing you  

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.760
are because i haven't seen any fall over yet if 
you're breathing god's not done with you yet still  

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:44.000
a battle in he's given you the armor to win your 
offense is the word of god the sword of the spirit  

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:52.000
let's go into battle together let's not just 
hang back in defense and make it to the end but  

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.800
let's go win the battle so what is winning the 
battle look like one to winning the battle in your  

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:02.560
own life but it's also winning the battle in other 
people's lives guys our purpose here as a church  

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.880
is not just to meet as believers and celebrate 
what god's done for us but it's really to share  

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:14.880
with others the hope that we have in jesus it's 
not good news if people don't hear it so we need  

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:21.200
to go to battle with our swords in our homes and 
our neighborhoods and our families our schools  

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.560
even in our churches and just tell people 
god loves you he sent his son jesus to die  

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:33.760
for because he loves you so much and we want you 
to know that we want to show you god's love but  

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.440
loving not not only on you but on your kids right 
with vacation bible school and encouraging you to  

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.560
to know the lord and walking alongside you right 
we're not here to condemn you we're really here to  

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:52.240
to actually free you from the enemy's lies we 
all have an enemy we all have an enemy it's just  

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.120
whether we realize we're in that battle and we 
know what to take up to go defeat that enemy right  

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:04.240
so it's important for us not to just say no right 
a lot of times when it comes to a believer early  

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.560
on it's like i just got to say no to sin no to 
sin no to sin well if all you do is say no to sin  

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.160
all you're going to do is think about that sin and 
then that's just going to attract you to sin right  

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.800
here's what it is it's not just 
saying noticing is saying yes to jesus  

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:22.320
so he says to turn from our sin and to to follow 
jesus and as we do we defeat our enemies it's not  

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:27.440
just about saying no but it's about saying yes so 
hebrews 4 12 even reminds us right that the word  

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.240
of god is a sword so it says this for the word 
of god is living and effective and sharper than  

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.840
any double-edged sword penetrating as far as the 
separation of the soul and spirit and joints and  

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.400
marrow it is able to judge the thoughts and the 
intentions of the heart and so the word of god  

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:50.000
pierces our hearts and convicts us of our sins 
right and i want to encourage you in this sin  

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.440
you know a lot of times sin sounds so 
condemning and really it it does condemn  

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.200
us to be separated from god in a relationship 
with him but you know what sin really is  

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:04.080
it's not god's best for you he's got something 
better for you if you think of it that way i'm  

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:09.920
okay great example i love ice cream and you guys 
may not understand this if you're from cincinnati  

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.120
but i'm from oklahoma and i love brahms ice 
cream if you don't know what brahms is i'm sorry  

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.480
but if somebody puts brahms ice cream 
up and they give me something else  

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:25.040
i'm choosing brahms every single time that is a 
horrible illustration for where i'm going here

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:34.000
but if god says freedom grace mercy he's 
going to stack love he's going to stack hope  

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:42.720
strength and then you have sin destruction lies 
deceiving which one you're going to choose i know  

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:49.680
which one i want to choose and it's a daily choice 
see that's what god does god's not sitting there  

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.920
wanting to make you feel like oh gosh you need 
to feel bad about your sin no yeah you need to  

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:59.120
turn from your sin but he doesn't want you to stay 
in that that moment of oh gosh this life apart  

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:04.800
from god he wants you to receive the freedom you 
have in that relationship i hope that makes sense  

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.720
to you because that really encourages me whenever 
i think about right it's not god's best for you  

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.760
but god has way more for you and he's 
offering it every day so we're just going to  

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.200
finish up this way i want to kind 
of pull it all together hopefully  

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.520
if you've missed everything i've said lean 
in now hopefully you can check back in okay  

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.800
hopefully your social media accounts are good too 
because i know i do that too i'll start scrolling  

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.320
facebook and forget everything so here you go 
turn them off let's go let's try to figure this  

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:34.000
out here so how do we win the battles in our 
lives how do we do it we're all facing a battle  

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:41.360
the first thing you need to realize is that you're 
in a battle i'm telling you this that sounds funny  

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:49.040
but that's it we do not realize we're in a battle 
but everybody's in a battle whether you know jesus  

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:55.760
or you don't you're in a battle and number two we 
have to realize that we're fighting battle from  

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:03.120
a victory why because we will be defeated if we 
don't realize that we are winning from the place  

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.560
of victory which means this sometimes you go into 
battle and you're losing every day and the problem  

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:14.160
is you haven't picked up god's vast strength or 
any of his armor to win so you have to realize  

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.920
god has given you the ability to win so you have 
to realize you're in a battle and you'll be given  

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:26.000
every piece to win that battle okay here's another 
one we have to know what god has given us right so  

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.960
okay god's given us something to win but what is 
it so it's the armor of god so here's just kind of  

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:36.400
a rundown of the armor of god right his armor of 
god comes with his vast strength and i'll always  

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.440
say this it's not just his strength paul clearly 
states vast your words may be totally different  

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.960
but vast strong whatever it is his vast strength 
it comes through his armor the belt of truth  

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.880
right knowing the truth to defeat the 
lies the breastplate of righteousness  

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:56.000
not leaving ourselves open to be wounded but 
protecting every crevice and part of ourselves  

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.440
to not be defeated the shoes of the gospel right 
receiving peace and giving peace the shield of  

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.880
faith again blocking the devil's attacks but 
then marching together in victory the helmet of  

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:12.400
salvation not just saving faith but walking in 
victory right and the last one is the sword of  

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:18.960
the spirit attacking the enemy with the sharp 
word of god why did paul tell us these things  

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.680
again another probably poor illustration but 
two days ago i was outside and brandon which  

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.640
isn't here he's leading this mission team he says 
hey you have a bee on your back i didn't want to  

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:35.840
get stung so he kind of shooted away see this is 
paul saying this you've got an enemy on your back  

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.920
and here's how to win why is paul telling you this 
because he wants you to be aware that you have an  

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:47.520
enemy and you're in a battle and here's how you 
defeat it see i love a friend like paul don't you  

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.840
want a friend like that that sees a bee on your 
back doesn't just run and scream like my daughter  

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.840
but that actually tells you and then helps you  

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:03.680
see we all have a friend in jesus right 
he makes us aware of our enemy he tells us  

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.880
how to defeat our enemy but here's what i know 
we'll never defeat an enemy we aren't aware of  

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.800
we'll never defeat an enemy by ignoring it or 
hoping for the best we will never defeat an enemy  

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:20.880
without a personal relationship with jesus the one 
who helps us overcome every single battle we're in  

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:27.200
so have you given your life to jesus i don't 
know only you can answer that question so here  

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.000
in a moment we're going to have invitation so i 
always communicate this why do we every church  

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.600
have this invitation where they sing a song and 
we're all supposed to stand there and act holy  

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.000
the purpose of invitation is really for us to 
consider all that god's just talked to us about  

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.200
if you didn't hear anything from me you heard 
the word of god i'm hoping you read that part  

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.640
and god spoke to you but this 
is a time for you to thank god  

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.200
where am i not picking up the armor of god 
in my life and applying it where do i need  

00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.640
to begin to write on my mirror in my bathroom on 
my journal wherever that i need to pick this up  

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.600
this is a time for you to consider 
is my relationship with jesus right  

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.600
maybe you haven't given your life to jesus and 
that's if you haven't the greatest thing is  

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:19.600
today is the dalation it's not complicated it's 
called knowing recognizing you need jesus asking  

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.240
god to forgive sins because you know that you 
can't do this without him and ask him to come  

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:32.000
in your life it's that simple and so i want to 
talk to you about that so during invitation one  

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.400
of the things that we do is me and my wife will 
stand in the back because we want to be able to  

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.560
talk with you if you have questions about what 
it means to follow jesus maybe you have questions  

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.880
about what i just talked about come back and talk 
to me ask those questions we want to help you  

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.880
figure out what that that 
means for you to follow jesus  

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.520
but here's the last thing i want to mention i 
know in a room this size there's a few of you  

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:01.520
that are struggling you're struggling to win the 
battles and you need someone to walk alongside  

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:07.600
you welcome to inspiring hope church that's 
what we're here for we are a family and if you  

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:14.480
are the first time here welcome to the family 
like we don't wait six weeks to figure out if  

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:21.600
you meet a certain criteria you're in we want 
to walk alongside you in this life i thank god  

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.560
that he's given us the opportunity to meet today 
to say that to you so if you need prayer because  

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.360
you're struggling in your battle you have a 
relationship with jesus but you're struggling  

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.880
come back there we want to pray with you we want 
to lift your arms up we want to walk alongside you  

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.520
don't miss the opportunity to consider what 
god's told you to say to apply it to your lives  

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:47.840
because god wants you to win the battle right 
he wants you to fight from the place of victory  

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:54.800
so as we pray we'll get done we'll all stand 
to worship but again please come and talk to  

00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:01.840
us if you have questions or you need prayer 
so let's pray lord jesus god you're good um

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:10.240
if i had time lord today i could share every 
single moment where you've extended grace but  

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:16.640
lord that might take years lord i know that i have 
been in such a need of your grace and mercy and  

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.760
a reminder of your word to win the battles in my 
life lord and even the battles i was facing last  

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:27.360
week and the battles i'll face next week lord i 
just thank you lord for your word to remind me  

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:33.520
what i need to pick up lord even as a pastor 
there's areas where i know i have not put on  

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:39.200
that armor and it is time for me to put it on 
and protect not only myself lord but also to go  

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.240
forward and win the battle lord for other 
people to help them discover hope in you  

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:51.360
lord i pray for every person in this room lord 
that if they're struggling in their faith or if  

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.400
they don't know you personally lord that they 
will stand up not only to worship and to to  

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.600
consider lord how you'll help them overcome this 
but lord may they walk to the back and find me  

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:09.600
or brittany and just say hey will you pray with 
me or will you tell me how it is to follow jesus  

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.840
lord i'm praying for that today 
because you are the one that draws us  

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.560
lord thank you for this time to celebrate all that 
you did through vacation bible school this week  

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.480
lord and i just pray that all of us will leave 
change this week because of what you taught us  

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:30.800
through your word and that it's truth so 
lord we pray this in your heavenly name amen
