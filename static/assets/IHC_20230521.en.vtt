00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.460
Well, good morning everybody that
I haven't said good morning to this

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.540
morning and if I had said good morning
to you, sorry, I'm saying it again.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.070
So I, uh, hope you guys have had a good
past week and if you haven't, good news.

00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:24.930
Sunday's, a new day and a new week.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.110
That's the one things I think
I have learned about Sunday's.

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:33.960
Um, is, uh, back whenever I first
gave my life to Christ, I told people

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.280
this like Sundays, I needed Sundays to
kind of reset my week, and then I, we

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.129
end up having Wednesday night church
back in the, you know, olden days.

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.470
Those of you who had Wednesday night
church go to church on Wednesdays.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.129
That's crazy.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.760
Um, but we went to church on Wednesdays
and I needed Wednesdays to get

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.420
me through the rest of the week.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.690
So it was like, Sundays got me through
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesdays got me

00:00:51.695 --> 00:00:55.830
through Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and
Saturdays I just wing winged it, right?

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.460
Um, but.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.530
I love Sundays.

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.879
Um, and I love the opportunity
to see you guys, um, and get the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.870
opportunity to worship together
and to get into God's word.

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.400
Um, and, uh, I, I don't know about
you guys, but I need Sundays.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.509
Anybody else like me, I, I need Sundays.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.740
Um, and, and that's just a sign of
that probably what God has deeply

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.090
convicted me of is the need for
community, uh, to be around people who

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.130
I genuinely love and care for that.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.300
Typically extend that back to me as
much as I extend to that to them.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.600
And so, um, anyways, I'm gonna
quit Jabber on and, and move on.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.199
So we have been in this series now,
this will be week five of our series

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.030
of Shalom, Shalom, um, and this idea of
God's perfect peace and how we receive

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.731
God's perfect peace in the midst of our
mental struggles and we've dealt with.

00:01:45.414 --> 00:01:48.744
Things like anxiety and
depression and worry.

00:01:48.955 --> 00:01:52.705
And today we get to think about,
um, uh, and talk about how we

00:01:52.705 --> 00:01:54.655
overcome our negative thoughts.

00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:57.384
Um, anybody in here ever
deal with negative thinking?

00:01:58.735 --> 00:01:59.785
God, I'm not the only one.

00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:03.895
There's some of you that are just
so positive and, uh, God bless you.

00:02:04.315 --> 00:02:06.295
I'm glad that you are who you are.

00:02:07.455 --> 00:02:08.055
Oh, okay.

00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:08.445
There you go.

00:02:08.445 --> 00:02:09.044
That's what you call it.

00:02:09.854 --> 00:02:12.885
Um, so when we think about God's perfect
piece, I actually started thinking

00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:14.745
about this as like, okay, we keep
talking about God's perfect piece.

00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:15.855
What is God's perfect piece?

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.535
And it's the presence of God in the midst
of our lives, in just general, right?

00:02:20.775 --> 00:02:24.945
But if we dive a little bit deeper, it's
knowing that God is with us in the midst

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:26.895
of some of our biggest struggles of life.

00:02:27.225 --> 00:02:29.685
Because I would say this
is when life's going good.

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:33.015
We don't really necessarily
see our need for God.

00:02:33.015 --> 00:02:36.255
We're like, okay, everything's great,
but it's really when we need God's

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:37.765
perfect pieces in the midst of chaos.

00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:41.895
Um, and so it's really God's presence
in the midst of, of difficulty.

00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:46.454
And so we're specifically diving in
to the idea of God's perfect peace

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.285
in the midst of our mental struggles.

00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:52.275
And, uh, you would think, how is
negative thoughts, mental struggles?

00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:56.475
And it, it absolutely is as we look at it,
is something that a lot of us deal with.

00:02:56.865 --> 00:02:58.635
And today, if you don't.

00:02:58.705 --> 00:03:04.075
Say, I'm not a negative person by the
end of the day, I'm hoping that maybe

00:03:04.075 --> 00:03:07.315
you'll be convinced that maybe you are a
negative person, just not all the time.

00:03:07.315 --> 00:03:11.185
Maybe it's in different areas, and we
can all work on that by God's obviously

00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:13.435
direction, um, and conviction in that.

00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:17.126
And so, uh, all I know is when I was
writing this message, I just, I was

00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:20.545
really just encouraged by myself.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.585
I think this is gonna be
the worst message ever.

00:03:22.795 --> 00:03:23.995
I think you guys are gonna hate it.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.335
And then it, then I started
writing and going, Hey, I'm doing

00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:30.465
exactly what I'm not supposed to
be doing, which is being negative.

00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:33.495
So hopefully it won't
be a negative message.

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:35.445
I don't know how it can't be.

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:37.245
So nobody is laughing with me.

00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:38.295
You're all laughing inside.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.955
I appreciate that.

00:03:39.525 --> 00:03:40.375
Um, yes, thanks.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.280
Thanks.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.550
Thank you.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.090
I appreciate that.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.820
Um, so again, I don't, I,
I, I really don't know.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.520
I mean, I obviously, I know there's a
group of people in here that may not

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.990
all be a lot like me when it comes
to thinking of life in this way.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.620
You ever heard somebody say, you look
at life like it's a glass half empty.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.970
Anybody heard that statement?

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.491
Or you're, you look at life
like it's a glass half full.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.800
I'm like, it's not only half empty.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.730
It's usually empty.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.880
Like, I usually see the worst
in everything I walk in, and if

00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:07.860
you want me to tell you what's
wrong with you, I'll tell you.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.440
Like, I don't know why I
have that mindset of like, I.

00:04:10.695 --> 00:04:13.065
I'm telling you it, I used
to be way worse than I am.

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:16.845
So if you know me and you've heard
negative from me, I've been worse before.

00:04:17.325 --> 00:04:19.755
Um, and that's what marriage
will make you better.

00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:23.235
Marriage will make you better because they
will call out your flaw flaws and you have

00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:26.175
to correct them or not continue marriage.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.645
And so I decided to continue marriage.

00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:27.705
Okay.

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.820
So, um, just, just want, want you to
think through this with me and, and

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.250
those of you who've been able to be
here during the middle of this whole

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.150
series, uh, is anybody related with
every single week of the series?

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.310
Anybody like me, related with
the whole week of the series?

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.100
Like, I mean, there's, I,
I don't know what it is.

00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:47.580
And just so you guys know, I don't
just change my lifestyle so that I

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.070
can relate with you when it comes
to all these mental struggles.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.850
I feel like I am.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.950
These mental struggles,
like this is my life.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.030
It's like I've dealt with anxiety,
depression, worry, and negative thinking.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.260
And here's the craziest part.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.160
I feel like every single week that
I've taught on those things, it's

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.750
been worse that week than ever before.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.070
Now, I think there's two reasons why.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.310
Number one, I'm studying about it
a lot and I'm more of aware of it.

00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:10.531
Number two, I think the
enemy is doing a great work.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.820
I really do.

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:14.370
And so if you ever think about,
Hey, how can I pray for Ben?

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.419
The messages in which I preach each week,
a lot of times get so deep inside me.

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:24.090
I think that enemy begins to work his
way in to begin to convince me of things

00:05:24.094 --> 00:05:26.039
that I shouldn't be convinced of, right?

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.760
In a very negative way or in a way
that would cause me not to speak

00:05:29.765 --> 00:05:31.380
truth and to speak confidently.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.740
Um, and so I realized in the midst
of this series, I'm like, do I really

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.820
struggle with these things all the time?

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.860
Or is it just because I'm walking
through this and I think it is

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.909
because I'm walking through this?

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.725
But, um, I wanna start
off with this question.

00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:44.215
Does anybody in this room
ever talk to themselves?

00:05:44.605 --> 00:05:45.025
Anybody?

00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:47.725
You ever catch yourself talking to
yourself, but then realize you're

00:05:47.725 --> 00:05:49.855
speaking out loud and there's
somebody next to you going, what?

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.055
And you're like, oh, that
was sensitive information.

00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:54.224
I shouldn't have said that out loud.

00:05:54.615 --> 00:05:58.065
Um, I would assume most of us talk to
ourselves, and we usually are doing this,

00:05:58.065 --> 00:06:01.425
like, don't forget to pick up the kids
and I've gotta go drop off the laundry,

00:06:01.425 --> 00:06:02.775
and man, I've gotta do all these things.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.784
So we're talking to ourselves
consistently about those things.

00:06:04.784 --> 00:06:08.865
But really what I'm asking is, do you
consistently talk to yourselves where you

00:06:08.865 --> 00:06:13.875
begin to be a little bit self-defeating,
like, man, I'm just not good enough.

00:06:14.655 --> 00:06:16.664
Uh, you know, I, I, I, I'm lazy.

00:06:17.435 --> 00:06:19.724
I, I, I, I'm never, I'm
never gonna be a good dad.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.780
I'm, I'm a horrible husband.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.940
I, I'm, I'm, whatever it is.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.410
Do you ever talk to yourself that way?

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.510
I catch myself doing that.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.240
And when we think about negative
thinking, that's usually where it starts.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.080
We tend to negatively start talking
about ourselves and we repeat it

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.440
over and over and over again and
it becomes this negative loop that

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.030
repeats over and over in our heads.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.550
And if you've ever been here
pre-service, we had this loop

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.840
of announcements that roll.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.990
And what ends up happening when you see
those announcements is it just becomes

00:06:45.995 --> 00:06:48.930
this loop of announcements that you've
seen over and over and over again.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.690
Um, and it really just
runs in our minds that way.

00:06:52.025 --> 00:06:54.815
Um, and when we think about
this, we, we think about, okay,

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:57.215
what, what can we do about it?

00:06:57.215 --> 00:06:59.045
How can we overcome some
of that negative thinking?

00:06:59.045 --> 00:07:02.675
And I just wanna give you some examples
exactly what it looks like when we think

00:07:02.675 --> 00:07:04.474
about our lives right in the morning.

00:07:04.474 --> 00:07:08.675
Does anybody ever say this, I've got so
much to do today that I need to work hard

00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:09.575
to get all those things accomplished.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.515
Anybody have a lot of things to do in the
day, but do you ever get to the end of the

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:14.465
day and go, I didn't get anything done?

00:07:15.455 --> 00:07:18.995
And then typically you're trying
to look back on your day and

00:07:18.995 --> 00:07:20.765
you begin to blame yourself.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.515
Because there was something you did.

00:07:22.515 --> 00:07:25.275
Now here's the thing you may
have, but typically it puts

00:07:25.275 --> 00:07:27.465
you in this negative light.

00:07:27.735 --> 00:07:29.805
Well then you're probably this
person that, okay, you know, we

00:07:29.805 --> 00:07:30.675
need to do better with our money.

00:07:30.675 --> 00:07:33.765
We need to better with our money, and
you spend wrong, and all of a sudden

00:07:33.885 --> 00:07:35.235
you're never gonna get right with money.

00:07:35.235 --> 00:07:36.435
You're never gonna do things right.

00:07:36.615 --> 00:07:39.645
Somebody does something wrong
to you and you go, I'm never

00:07:39.645 --> 00:07:40.995
gonna trust that person again.

00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:41.415
Right?

00:07:41.925 --> 00:07:43.755
And it just goes on and on again.

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:44.775
And this is what I have learned.

00:07:44.775 --> 00:07:47.775
I, I've actually, so I'm gonna bring
Brittany this, I got approval to do this.

00:07:48.225 --> 00:07:51.625
Um, There's times where Britney will begin
to say, you know, I'm just not a good

00:07:51.625 --> 00:07:53.155
mother, another good, not a good wife.

00:07:53.215 --> 00:07:56.185
And I have literally stopped her,
looked in her face and said, stop

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:57.085
talking to my wife like that.

00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:59.250
And she goes, what are you doing?

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.760
I'm like, no, I'm not allowing
you to speak to my wife like that.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.109
And that kind of makes her laugh.

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:08.400
And then it realizes that sometimes we
need somebody to take up for ourselves.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.179
Like, does that make sense?

00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:13.620
Like you need somebody to take up for
you because we are so self-defeating.

00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:16.530
I have people in this church that build
me up because I'm usually one that tears

00:08:16.536 --> 00:08:19.830
myself down and I need people like that.

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:21.780
And I would even say,
let's go a step deeper.

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:25.260
Jesus is saying to my wife, don't
speak to my daughter like that.

00:08:26.085 --> 00:08:28.935
See, I think when we think about
negative thinking, we, we have to

00:08:28.935 --> 00:08:33.284
look a little bit deeper and realize
that we're destroying ourselves.

00:08:33.885 --> 00:08:36.105
And we're distracting ourselves
from the beauty of who we are.

00:08:36.105 --> 00:08:37.425
Yes, we're broken and infallible.

00:08:37.425 --> 00:08:41.025
People that will make mistakes and not
hit the mark on sometimes, but man,

00:08:41.025 --> 00:08:45.285
those negative thoughts, that loop that
keeps running, will destroy your lives

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.095
and distract you from what God has
given you, which is God's perfect peace.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.630
So the question is, what
do you say to yourselves?

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.990
Only you'll know what you say to
yourselves, but Proverbs 4 23 says

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.690
this, and I don't have this up on the
screen, and I had to dive a little bit

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.370
deeper to kind of look at this verse.

00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:01.680
So it's the good news
translation says it this way.

00:09:01.685 --> 00:09:04.290
In Proverbs 4 23, and this
should be on your papers, it

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.440
says, be careful how you think.

00:09:06.465 --> 00:09:08.775
Your life is shaped by your thoughts.

00:09:09.075 --> 00:09:12.225
And then you see the quote
there from Pastor uh uh, Dr.

00:09:12.225 --> 00:09:12.915
Paul David Tripp.

00:09:12.915 --> 00:09:18.675
He says this, no one is more influential
in your life than you are because no

00:09:18.675 --> 00:09:20.865
one talks to you more than you do.

00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:24.630
You've heard me quote this from
Craig Rochelle, multiple times your

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.390
life is heading in the direction
of your strongest thoughts.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.920
So if that's a true statement, if
we are our worst critics, right?

00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:36.089
If what we think about and what we think
about ourselves is impacting, then that

00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:40.970
means that we are allowing those negative
thoughts to be a stronghold in our life.

00:09:41.954 --> 00:09:45.555
So that's why we're going to talk about
how we can overcome our negative thoughts.

00:09:45.555 --> 00:09:47.954
I wanna pray for us and then
we're gonna continue on.

00:09:48.074 --> 00:09:51.435
So, Lord Jesus, as we've kind of set the
stage, Lord, for what we're talking about

00:09:51.435 --> 00:09:55.665
today, I know that many of us maybe are
drawing in to being able to relate with.

00:09:56.219 --> 00:09:59.969
This negative thinking maybe about
ourselves or about those around us, or

00:09:59.969 --> 00:10:01.469
about the things that we're involved in.

00:10:01.469 --> 00:10:04.949
And so, Lord, I just pray that as we
are reflecting today, Lord, that we'll

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.780
walk outta here being able to learn
how to begin to overcome our negative

00:10:09.785 --> 00:10:13.620
thinking, uh, only through your power,
through your Word and through your spirit,

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.910
will you be able to help us do that.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.170
And Lord, I pray today that we take
one step to doing that so that we can

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.780
continue to experience your perfect peace.

00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:23.370
And we pray this in your heaven name.

00:10:23.819 --> 00:10:24.150
Amen.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.520
So how many y'all agree that we
are living in a society that is

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.380
becoming more and more negative?

00:10:31.385 --> 00:10:31.689
Anybody?

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.165
Um, and here's the reason why I, I ask
that question because I, and I want to

00:10:36.165 --> 00:10:39.735
kind of prove this because I think we're
seeing it more and more in society.

00:10:39.735 --> 00:10:42.465
And so what I would love to do
is get some feedback from you.

00:10:42.465 --> 00:10:44.805
And so I'm gonna ask a question and then
you're just gonna have to respond to this.

00:10:44.805 --> 00:10:50.445
So question, if you're on social
media and you see somebody post

00:10:50.445 --> 00:10:54.495
something positive or something
negative, which one gets more traction?

00:10:56.385 --> 00:10:56.985
Negative.

00:10:57.045 --> 00:10:57.315
Okay.

00:10:57.465 --> 00:10:59.235
Now let's just go dive
a little bit deeper.

00:10:59.385 --> 00:11:04.605
If you're on, you know, a news
app is something that is posted

00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:08.415
positive on that news app or tr
something tragic on that news app.

00:11:08.415 --> 00:11:09.265
Which one's getting more traction?

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:11.310
Tragic.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:11.490
Okay.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:15.060
I wanna give you one further, and
really, this is just my personal example.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.420
What do you think happened one day when
I was invited to preach at a church

00:11:18.425 --> 00:11:19.830
and I was so anxious about doing it?

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.900
And I go up there and I preach,
and I had five people after the

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.520
service say, Hey, great message.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.520
But I had one person
mention one small thing.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.900
Do you think I dwelled on the five that
was positive or the one that was negative?

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.330
We all do that.

00:11:33.335 --> 00:11:35.160
Typically, we all are.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.100
Somehow it's in our lives,
we're somehow ingrained.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.500
To focus on negative stories, negative
thinking, it, it is something inside

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:49.110
of us, and so when I say something
inside of us, it's our natural response.

00:11:49.484 --> 00:11:52.484
Not our spiritual response, but
it's our natural response, right?

00:11:52.574 --> 00:11:56.175
And it's amazing that we
understand how natural that is.

00:11:56.175 --> 00:11:59.084
And so I wanna give you two statements
that we're gonna repeat over and over

00:11:59.084 --> 00:12:01.454
again so that we grab hold of this.

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:04.814
But number one, your thoughts
have incredible power.

00:12:04.964 --> 00:12:07.155
Your thoughts have incredible power.

00:12:07.285 --> 00:12:09.555
Power negatively and positively, right?

00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:13.724
But the good news is that you have
incredible power over your thoughts, and

00:12:13.724 --> 00:12:17.474
you need to hear that today just because
your power, your thoughts are powerful,

00:12:17.984 --> 00:12:22.574
that they may be negative, that you have
control over those powerful thoughts, and

00:12:22.574 --> 00:12:24.314
we're gonna see how God directs us, right?

00:12:24.435 --> 00:12:25.454
So I wanna read this to you.

00:12:25.454 --> 00:12:29.204
If our lives are heading the direction
of our strongest thoughts, then by the

00:12:29.204 --> 00:12:34.574
power of God, you can actually choose
what you think about and what you think

00:12:34.574 --> 00:12:36.525
about will determine how you live.

00:12:36.885 --> 00:12:41.564
I wanna read, uh, Romans chapter eight,
verse five and six, um, to kind of even

00:12:41.564 --> 00:12:42.495
walk through this a little bit more.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:43.215
So we're gonna start there.

00:12:43.215 --> 00:12:46.305
Romans chapter eight, verse five
and six, and this is what it says.

00:12:46.305 --> 00:12:49.814
It says, for those who live according
to the flesh, have their minds

00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:51.135
set on the things of the flesh.

00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:53.865
But those who live according to
the spirit have their minds set

00:12:53.865 --> 00:12:54.885
on the things of the spirit.

00:12:55.395 --> 00:12:58.725
Now, the mindset of this flesh
is death, but the mindset of

00:12:58.725 --> 00:13:01.215
the spirit is life and peace.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.990
I want to make sure
that we understand here.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.530
When he uses the word flesh,
he's not talking about our skin.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.430
I'm just, the reason why I say that is
because for me as a new believer, when

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.400
I'm reading these things, I'm like,
I don't have my mind set on my flesh.

00:13:14.405 --> 00:13:18.810
I mean, like, it's kind of ugly, but
like that's not, I mean, I'm serious.

00:13:18.814 --> 00:13:20.130
Those are the things
that go through my mind.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:20.970
So what does it mean?

00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:24.944
Having the mindset of the flesh, what does
it mean to have the mindset of the flesh?

00:13:24.944 --> 00:13:28.035
This is where we look at and we
say, okay, the mindset of the flesh

00:13:28.064 --> 00:13:32.415
is really talking about our sinful
desires and our sinful nature.

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.454
So basically, this is what Paul's saying.

00:13:34.454 --> 00:13:38.324
Those who live according to their
sinful nature, they had their mindset

00:13:38.324 --> 00:13:42.285
on their natural desires, their
sinful, na natural desires, right?

00:13:42.285 --> 00:13:45.525
So selfish living creates
self selfish thinking.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.750
But then we see in verse six, but
the good news is those who live

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.800
according to the spirit have their
mind set on spiritual desires, right?

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.939
Life and peace.

00:13:53.939 --> 00:13:55.890
So selfless living, selfless thinking.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.780
So what does this mean to us?

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:02.130
If our minds are controlled by
our flesh, the result is death.

00:14:02.939 --> 00:14:04.140
Darkness and destruction.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.610
And if our minds are controlled by the
spirit, it leads to life and peace.

00:14:08.819 --> 00:14:10.020
Why do we need to hear this?

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:14.310
When we allow that negative loop about
ourselves, about our circumstances, about

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:17.400
those around us, we are feeding death.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.480
And I don't know about this, but as
anybody, no, I, here's the thing.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.520
I know some of y'all want
to get to heaven quickly.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.319
I, I would love to see Jesus as well.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.170
Okay, so some of y'all are gonna
answer this a little bit differently,

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.180
but I think death is kind of scary.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.095
I mean, I don't like losing people.

00:14:34.185 --> 00:14:35.055
I, I really don't.

00:14:35.055 --> 00:14:36.735
So to me, death is scary.

00:14:37.215 --> 00:14:38.595
Darkness is scary.

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.535
Cuz even as an adult, there's
sometimes I think there's a scary

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.125
monster in the dark, being honest.

00:14:43.125 --> 00:14:44.595
That's why I quickly turn on the lights.

00:14:45.765 --> 00:14:48.225
So death and darkness is not
where I want to be and I don't

00:14:48.225 --> 00:14:49.215
think it's where you wanna be.

00:14:49.845 --> 00:14:52.515
But when we negatively think
about things and when we're

00:14:52.515 --> 00:14:55.725
constantly tearing ourselves
down, all we're doing is bringing

00:14:55.725 --> 00:14:58.845
darkness, not peace into our lives.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.680
But when we lean into the spirit,
right, and we place our minds on the

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.150
spirit, then we receive life and peace.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.410
Life and peace.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.910
Those are two things that I want.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.530
You guys want life and peace.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:14.610
Amen.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.590
So those are things that we desire.

00:15:16.595 --> 00:15:19.439
We want, and I, again, I, I would guess
at this point in the message, all of

00:15:19.439 --> 00:15:21.480
your price in there going, we want that.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.230
But here's the problem.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.660
Why does darkness always find me?

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.349
And we're gonna go maybe
trolls over here, right?

00:15:28.349 --> 00:15:28.949
Hello, darkness.

00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:29.430
You're my friend.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:30.780
Maybe that's where you love hanging out.

00:15:32.609 --> 00:15:34.170
Maybe you don't know
how to get out of that.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.930
And so today we wanna address that, right?

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.310
But here's the thing.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:42.630
Darkness and destruction
control us at times.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.040
And the spirit leaves to life and peace.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.969
And so I want us to say this, and
if we find ourselves always being

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.430
negative, focused on all of these things
that drag us down and bring us into

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.709
darkness and always feel encouraged.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.300
We know there's a way out.

00:15:54.675 --> 00:15:56.745
By putting our minds on Jesus.

00:15:57.255 --> 00:15:58.964
So we're gonna talk about three
things today, and we're gonna

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.675
continue to dive into these things.

00:16:00.675 --> 00:16:03.735
And at the end, we're gonna really
land, hopefully home to help

00:16:03.765 --> 00:16:06.675
each one of us and what we can
do, and we can learn from David.

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:09.194
And again, David was a
man after God's own heart.

00:16:09.255 --> 00:16:10.694
He made some mistakes.

00:16:10.725 --> 00:16:13.905
He dealt with darkness, but
he did something that I hope

00:16:13.905 --> 00:16:14.805
will challenge you today.

00:16:14.865 --> 00:16:16.725
So we're gonna address three
things today and discuss them.

00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:21.074
One, why is negativity not only
hurting you, but your family, your

00:16:21.074 --> 00:16:22.485
relationships, and your marriage?

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.060
And the direction of your life.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.810
Number two, we'll identify some
specific areas of negativity.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.440
So again, those who may say, I'm
not negative today, you might dig a

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.600
little deeper and find that you are.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.810
And then number three, we're gonna discuss
by the power of God's word through the

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:43.440
spirit of God, how we can change from
death, right negativity into life and find

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.840
the perfect peace that God has for us.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.070
So let's start with the first one.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.740
Why is negativity so toxic?

00:16:50.699 --> 00:16:52.920
Again, I already kind of bringed
up some of those things, right?

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.750
The idea behind negativity always
seems to be the things that people run

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.140
after click on and uh, focus on, right?

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.040
But what we begin to realize is
that as we include all these things

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.389
into our life, think about this.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:07.910
Who are you placing yourself around?

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.265
What are you looking at on social media?

00:17:11.265 --> 00:17:13.245
What are you, what news
app are you following?

00:17:13.245 --> 00:17:15.015
And this is not a Republican
or Democrat thing.

00:17:15.315 --> 00:17:19.485
What are you allowing negatively
into your life that is influencing

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:20.535
you to become negative?

00:17:20.925 --> 00:17:22.695
Because it's not usually just one thing.

00:17:23.115 --> 00:17:25.545
It's not just yourself
negatively defeating you.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:29.805
It's multiple things that you're
allowing to influence your life.

00:17:30.225 --> 00:17:34.230
And when we allow those things to be
consistent in our lives, Then they

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.830
begin to now lead and direct our lives.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.560
You've heard me talk about a
couple weeks ago, this idea

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.270
behind these neuro pathways.

00:17:42.275 --> 00:17:45.480
The more we think on a thought,
the more likely that we're

00:17:45.485 --> 00:17:46.710
able to think on that thought.

00:17:47.595 --> 00:17:50.085
Easier and more often
and more often, right?

00:17:50.535 --> 00:17:53.655
And so what we realize is when we
begin to allow these negative things

00:17:53.655 --> 00:17:58.215
into our lives, we create these neuro
pathways, negative neuro pathways, and

00:17:58.215 --> 00:18:00.975
they become negative habits, right?

00:18:01.575 --> 00:18:04.425
Um, and so what I would say
with this is you need people

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.225
like my wife that will hear me.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.100
Come home from the gym and I'll
communicate like, this was bad.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.110
And man, this was, this was bad here.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.090
And all of a sudden she stops
me and here's what she says.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.490
And you can't say anything
negative again until you say three

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:18.630
things positive about your day.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.190
And the reason why is we get
so consumed by the negative.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:27.120
We forget all the good things that
happened, all the good things.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.650
I'll give you guys a great example.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.750
Recently I've been sharing with
you about our car troubles.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.150
You know what, I got to talking to
a family member before, you know,

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.970
and our, my, me and Brittany's
now, were almost been together.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.760
So from dating and marriage 20
years, you know, we've had very

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.100
little car issues in 20 years.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:41.520
Very little.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.340
I mean a few here or there,
but this is the first major car

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.340
issue in 20 years perspective.

00:18:47.514 --> 00:18:48.570
Perspective the other day.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.980
Everything's falling apart.

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:51.720
The world's crazy.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.450
We're not gonna make, I mean,
you guys know how that is, right?

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.900
If I only focus on the negative,
what we're going through

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.040
is the worst thing ever.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.260
But 20 years, this is pretty good.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.840
Cuz I've talked to a couple
people that they said, yeah, we've

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.220
lost six cars in the last five.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:05.650
Okay.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.860
Perspective is great.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.300
So when we think about these negative
thoughts, we've got to stop, pull

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.190
back, have people in our lives.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.500
That remind us of the good that is
going on or the, the situation's

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.090
not as bad as we think, right?

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.640
And so when we think about this, right,
our mind is controlled by the flesh.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.910
It's death, it's defeating, it's
out to still kill and destroy.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.440
But we have to remember that our
thoughts, again, have incredible

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:37.230
power over the direction of our life,
either negatively or positively.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.110
So let's talk about how we identify.

00:19:40.469 --> 00:19:43.260
The negative areas and then
we're gonna quickly move on.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.300
I wanna make sure that we have
plenty of time to get through this.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.050
So what areas of negativity
are you dealing with?

00:19:49.469 --> 00:19:53.699
Um, I would say this be we are all prone
to these areas at some point in our life.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.680
Um, and so I'm gonna
go through four of 'em.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.660
They are on your sheet
there, you can look at them.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.190
The first one is cynicism.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.360
So what is cynicism?

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.260
It's a big word.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.780
I could hardly even say
it earlier this week.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.980
So just so you know that.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.150
So cynicism is general distrust
for people and their motives.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.480
Uh, basically in this idea,
you can't trust people.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:12.931
Everyone's out to get you.

00:20:12.936 --> 00:20:14.520
There're there to take advantage of you.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.440
If you wanna know that example,
it's like car salesman.

00:20:20.475 --> 00:20:21.075
Oh, okay.

00:20:22.274 --> 00:20:23.955
Um, so anyways, car salesman.

00:20:24.615 --> 00:20:27.105
Uh, so most of us don't trust them.

00:20:27.105 --> 00:20:28.245
If you're a car salesman, I'm sorry.

00:20:28.425 --> 00:20:30.615
Most of us don't trust them
because they're always liars.

00:20:30.615 --> 00:20:31.245
That's what we think.

00:20:31.845 --> 00:20:35.745
And every car salesman's gonna treat
you that way, but it goes further than

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:36.826
that when you begin to think about.

00:20:37.825 --> 00:20:40.290
Every guy is this way and
every girl is this way.

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.020
And if you've ever done anything,
you're just always gonna think

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.580
that people are out to get you.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.690
They're always distrustful.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.570
And here's the craziest part, just
so you know, those of you may who

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:53.879
may relate with this, experts say
that the reason why that you have

00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:57.450
this, that typically it's generally a
reflection of how you view yourself.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.540
That's tough.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.530
So when you distrust oth others,
it often reveals that you don't

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.210
always trust your own motives.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.705
And again, that's something
we could dive into deeper.

00:21:09.705 --> 00:21:10.995
We're not gonna dive into deeper today.

00:21:11.054 --> 00:21:15.344
So the next one is negative
filtering, just seeing what's wrong.

00:21:15.975 --> 00:21:17.625
Uh, and that's me, right?

00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:21.524
Finding the worst possible thing to point
out in a situation overlooking what's

00:21:21.524 --> 00:21:23.564
good, assuming the worst possible outcome.

00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:27.344
Great example, if your child's
running late from going out with

00:21:27.344 --> 00:21:29.504
their friends, you assume they're
in a car wreck and they've died.

00:21:31.245 --> 00:21:32.445
Man, I love Laura's over here.

00:21:32.445 --> 00:21:35.985
She's just, she's gonna point
everybody in the room if you wanna

00:21:35.985 --> 00:21:37.635
know who's got what she's gonna point.

00:21:37.665 --> 00:21:37.965
Okay.

00:21:38.235 --> 00:21:38.804
I love it.

00:21:39.105 --> 00:21:40.334
Thanks for helping everybody.

00:21:40.334 --> 00:21:42.284
They needed, this is great.

00:21:42.495 --> 00:21:43.814
I love the participation.

00:21:44.745 --> 00:21:48.735
Um, I, I would say this, you're
also going to be the one that, uh,

00:21:48.735 --> 00:21:52.485
and, and this is meme, uh, until
I became a part of this church.

00:21:52.814 --> 00:21:55.155
When you text a friend and
they don't text for two hours,

00:21:55.155 --> 00:21:56.115
you think they're mad at you.

00:21:56.475 --> 00:22:02.040
Every guy in this room is that, So
I've learned you guys don't hate me.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.150
You're just busy.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.800
Um, but that's you.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.110
If you're, you text and your friend
doesn't text back quick enough,

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.370
you're like, they, they hate me.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.120
They're mad at me.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:09.450
Right.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.700
I love how everybody's laughing, right?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.650
This is another one that
you may relate with.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:17.790
You go to a restaurant and you always find
something negative about that restaurant,

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.940
and usually it's probably to justify
why you don't give them a good tip.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:21.480
Hmm.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.290
That's a tough one.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.520
Uh, here's one that, those of you who've
been a part of a difficult church or

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.014
a bad church, Every church you go to,
you always find what's wrong with it

00:22:30.014 --> 00:22:31.215
so you don't have to go to it again.

00:22:32.385 --> 00:22:34.004
I mean, some of y'all that may be true.

00:22:34.004 --> 00:22:36.195
You come and you only see the
negative in the church, and then

00:22:36.195 --> 00:22:37.425
that's why you don't go to church.

00:22:38.175 --> 00:22:41.175
I, and here's the thing, guys, your we,
we talked about this a couple weeks ago.

00:22:41.294 --> 00:22:43.815
Your emotions and all of
these situations are valid.

00:22:43.875 --> 00:22:45.764
Obviously you're going through
them and processing through them,

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:48.225
but where you're sitting with
them is not where we need to stay.

00:22:48.225 --> 00:22:49.155
It's not beneficial.

00:22:49.514 --> 00:22:52.725
When we think about these things,
let's keep going on absolute thinking.

00:22:52.754 --> 00:22:54.855
All or nothing, black or white, right?

00:22:54.855 --> 00:22:58.335
This is where we say, again,
kind of we're more specific.

00:22:58.395 --> 00:23:01.065
If a man hurt me, then
all men are gonna hurt me.

00:23:01.065 --> 00:23:02.805
If a woman lies, all women are gonna lie.

00:23:02.805 --> 00:23:03.975
Here's a tough one.

00:23:04.485 --> 00:23:07.754
If a Republican or Democrat does
something wrong, all of them are bad.

00:23:07.925 --> 00:23:08.215
Okay?

00:23:08.504 --> 00:23:10.365
I'm not, that's as much
political as I'm gonna get today.

00:23:10.395 --> 00:23:10.695
Okay?

00:23:11.145 --> 00:23:12.975
Um, and again, goes down the line.

00:23:12.975 --> 00:23:15.315
If the, if a church hurts you,
all churches are gonna hurt you.

00:23:15.645 --> 00:23:16.935
This is where we get cancel culture.

00:23:17.685 --> 00:23:17.970
Right.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.320
Somebody wrongs me, I'm writing 'em off
and I'll never give them another chance.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.870
And most likely I'll never
give somebody else that looks,

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.270
acts, smells like that person.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.590
It's crazy.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.370
But that's true.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.720
Um, let's just continue on.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.600
Uh, blaming.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.410
This isn't another one.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:34.860
Blaming.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.350
This is where you believe
that you're always the victim.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:38.880
You're always the victim.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.260
You've never done anything wrong.

00:23:40.265 --> 00:23:42.060
It's just your circumstances.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.660
It's somebody else's fault, um,
because they did it, because

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:46.650
you don't have control over it.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.890
You're just a victim of your
life, of your circumstances, and

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:50.940
the world is stacked against you.

00:23:52.215 --> 00:23:54.465
So we quickly walk through
these four different ones.

00:23:54.465 --> 00:23:56.685
And again, these are from professionals
that they've kind of narrowed

00:23:56.685 --> 00:23:59.535
these down to these four categories
where we're negative in our lives.

00:23:59.925 --> 00:24:01.035
So here's the question, right?

00:24:01.035 --> 00:24:05.955
If we find ourselves constantly jealous or
critical or disconnected, or assuming the

00:24:05.955 --> 00:24:10.625
worst or hard on other people, or hard on
yourself, the question is, can you change?

00:24:11.565 --> 00:24:14.865
I mean, if that's just who you are, I,
I, I've heard somebody say this before,

00:24:14.865 --> 00:24:16.245
it's like, this is just who I am.

00:24:17.055 --> 00:24:18.045
But does that mean.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.340
That that's okay to be who you
are if you are always negative.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.770
And, and so let me just by
raise the hands, who loves

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:26.850
being around a negative person.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.570
Okay, there we go.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:31.080
I know it's coming.

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.540
I was waiting on it cuz somebody's been
like, Hey, I actually kinda like it.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.500
Yeah, there we go.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:34.950
It happened.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:36.840
Um, okay.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:37.470
Yourself?

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.340
You like yourself?

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:39.610
Yeah.

00:24:41.385 --> 00:24:43.485
See that that is actually
a true statement.

00:24:43.485 --> 00:24:46.095
Those of us who are negative
do like being around ourselves.

00:24:46.095 --> 00:24:46.365
Right?

00:24:46.815 --> 00:24:49.365
Um, but the question is,
can we change our mindset?

00:24:49.365 --> 00:24:52.395
And this is where I want to, to,
to dive a little bit more into the

00:24:52.395 --> 00:24:55.425
word, but I also want to kind of give
you something that I think's always

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.245
really cool when we begin to think
about these studies that are done.

00:24:58.274 --> 00:24:59.386
So there was a study done.

00:25:00.615 --> 00:25:03.015
And it was a TED Talk that was
shared with this, and I, I love this.

00:25:03.345 --> 00:25:06.465
They brought these groups of people
together and they talked to them

00:25:06.465 --> 00:25:10.575
about this figurative, um, basically
procedure that they could do.

00:25:10.755 --> 00:25:11.625
And they brought the two groups.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.595
They separated them, they went into
one group, and this is what they said.

00:25:14.595 --> 00:25:17.235
They said, Hey, we got this new procedure.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.595
If you were to have this procedure,
if it was, if you needed it and it was

00:25:20.595 --> 00:25:22.605
a 70% success rate, would you do it?

00:25:22.605 --> 00:25:23.835
And they're like, absolutely.

00:25:24.445 --> 00:25:25.050
100%.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.419
So they went to the other group,
they walked in, they said, okay,

00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:31.350
we got this new procedure, but
it's a 30% chance of failure.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.209
And the majority of them
said, no, we wouldn't do it.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.520
Okay, now then what?

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.469
They said, let's, let's
switch these groups.

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:41.310
Well, let's, let's go back to 'em and
say, Hey, the one that said 70%, Hey, I

00:25:41.314 --> 00:25:45.360
just wanna remind you, yes, it's still
70% success, but we wanna remind you that

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.959
there's a 30% chance that, that you won't
survive if you were to do this procedure.

00:25:48.959 --> 00:25:49.320
And they went.

00:25:50.445 --> 00:25:50.985
Oh really?

00:25:50.985 --> 00:25:54.465
And they begin to change their minds,
but they went back to the 30%, the

00:25:54.465 --> 00:25:56.055
one that they said, Hey, 30% bad.

00:25:56.085 --> 00:25:57.195
That's the only thing they said 30% bad.

00:25:57.195 --> 00:25:58.695
And most of them said they
wouldn't do the procedure.

00:25:58.905 --> 00:26:00.765
Hey, what if we change
that statistic over?

00:26:00.885 --> 00:26:04.815
And we said, and reminded you that it's
not only 30% bad, but it's also 70% good.

00:26:04.815 --> 00:26:08.745
Most of them still stayed with the
30% saying, you know, I still don't

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.305
believe that the surgery is good.

00:26:10.815 --> 00:26:12.915
And what you're wondering
is, what do you mean?

00:26:13.274 --> 00:26:14.145
Isn't the same thing.

00:26:14.264 --> 00:26:16.514
Well, one, I think there's a
math problem here most people

00:26:16.514 --> 00:26:17.715
probably aren't correlating.

00:26:17.715 --> 00:26:20.264
When they walk into a room and
somebody says 70% good, they're

00:26:20.264 --> 00:26:21.855
not correlating the 30% bad.

00:26:22.725 --> 00:26:25.185
What I'm saying is, what
people hear matters.

00:26:25.185 --> 00:26:26.805
What we hear matters.

00:26:27.105 --> 00:26:29.504
They walked in that room and
the only words they said was,

00:26:29.565 --> 00:26:31.695
this surgery is 70% successful.

00:26:31.695 --> 00:26:33.105
They didn't say anything about the 30%.

00:26:33.945 --> 00:26:34.875
They didn't bring that up.

00:26:35.235 --> 00:26:36.165
They didn't talk about it.

00:26:36.315 --> 00:26:37.185
They didn't focus on it.

00:26:37.185 --> 00:26:38.685
All they focused on was the good.

00:26:39.405 --> 00:26:42.135
The other group, the only thing
they focused on was the negative.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:47.100
The reason why they made the decisions
was because of the negative thinking and

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.790
the negative perception that was brought,
and it was hard for them to change.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.540
So again, you say, well then is it gonna
be easy to change our negative thinking?

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.260
No.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:00.660
But with God, all things are possible
because a lot of times we get in these

00:27:00.665 --> 00:27:03.660
circumstances and we get in these
situations with this negative thinking

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.950
or whatever mental struggle we're dealing
with, and we're like, but it's hard if

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.660
you've ever dealt with an addiction.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.595
And I don't know if you have,
if you've ever dealt with an

00:27:11.595 --> 00:27:15.075
addiction from drugs, to alcohol,
to pornography, to you name it.

00:27:15.254 --> 00:27:18.345
If you've ever dealt
with it, it's never easy.

00:27:19.815 --> 00:27:20.325
Why?

00:27:20.565 --> 00:27:24.675
Because that addiction was something
that you did over and over and over and

00:27:24.675 --> 00:27:30.255
over, and over and over again, and it
became a habit or negative thinking.

00:27:30.261 --> 00:27:32.205
What did I say is a habit?

00:27:33.135 --> 00:27:36.705
And it's something that we've done
over and over and it becomes to say

00:27:36.705 --> 00:27:38.445
what I said earlier, it is who we are.

00:27:38.505 --> 00:27:39.765
That's just who I am.

00:27:40.545 --> 00:27:41.985
Remember me saying this
a couple weeks ago?

00:27:41.985 --> 00:27:45.495
I said, Hey, I used to call myself a
realist and I realized that a realist

00:27:45.495 --> 00:27:49.185
is somebody that actually sees reality
in everything good and bad For me.

00:27:49.185 --> 00:27:50.325
I was just a negatives.

00:27:50.655 --> 00:27:53.595
I just always saw the bad and
everything, and I had to come

00:27:53.595 --> 00:27:55.005
to that conclusion for myself.

00:27:55.305 --> 00:27:56.265
I'm not a realist.

00:27:56.535 --> 00:27:57.405
I just like being negative.

00:27:57.405 --> 00:28:01.335
I like seeing that everything half
empty and I had to begin to change that.

00:28:01.575 --> 00:28:02.325
How's it going?

00:28:02.885 --> 00:28:05.220
It's going okay, I'm learning.

00:28:05.879 --> 00:28:08.850
But what I realized is
it was affecting me.

00:28:09.449 --> 00:28:10.350
It was affecting me.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.100
It's hard.

00:28:11.459 --> 00:28:13.740
What all we do is see the
negative and everything.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.600
It becomes destructive.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.740
So God gives us a great
example in his word.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.321
So let's look at this story here.

00:28:22.326 --> 00:28:24.360
We're gonna be in First Samuel.

00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:26.939
Again, it should be on your sheets,
but first Samuel chapter 30.

00:28:26.939 --> 00:28:28.050
It's gonna be up on the screen as well.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.209
And we're gonna read
verses three through six.

00:28:31.125 --> 00:28:33.105
Highlighting mostly three, four, and six.

00:28:33.105 --> 00:28:34.334
And this is the story of David.

00:28:34.334 --> 00:28:37.875
So David, again, we know David
is, uh, king after God's own

00:28:37.875 --> 00:28:39.885
heart and he was appointed by God.

00:28:39.885 --> 00:28:43.365
He, David's the one that destroyed,
you know, the, the giant.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:45.435
And you know, he's this awesome guy.

00:28:45.435 --> 00:28:48.254
And yes, he has some things, if you know
his story, he has kind of a checkered

00:28:48.254 --> 00:28:52.605
pass, but he's out there fighting for
the Lord and they come back to camp and

00:28:52.605 --> 00:28:55.215
there's something that happens when they
come back to camp, him and his warriors.

00:28:55.395 --> 00:28:56.745
So let's look at this together.

00:28:56.955 --> 00:28:58.274
Hey, I might want to turn there first.

00:28:59.084 --> 00:28:59.745
That's kind of funny.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.580
All right.

00:29:03.045 --> 00:29:05.805
This is what it says,
verse three through six.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:10.335
It says, when David and his men arrived
at the town, they found it burned.

00:29:10.485 --> 00:29:11.325
This is when they came home.

00:29:11.535 --> 00:29:14.445
Their wives, their sons, and their
daughters had been kidnapped.

00:29:14.955 --> 00:29:20.085
David and the troops with him wept loudly
until they had no strength left to weep.

00:29:20.595 --> 00:29:21.375
David's two wives.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:22.810
I don't know how to say 'em.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:29.170
Um, Ana Hyam and Jere and Abigail,
the widow of Naval, the Carmelite

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.450
has been kidnapped and David was an
extremely difficult position because

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.960
the troops talked about stoning him for,
they were all very bitter over their

00:29:37.965 --> 00:29:39.490
loss of their sons, their daughters.

00:29:40.379 --> 00:29:43.620
But David found strength
in the Lord his God.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.490
But David found strength
in the Lord his God.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.230
So let me just kind of set the stage here.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.220
Think about this.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:55.379
David is representing God to these
troops and something bad happened

00:29:55.379 --> 00:29:58.180
in their life and they had reason
to be negative because their family

00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:59.431
had been taken away from them.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.220
And at this moment, David's
not only worried about his own

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.540
family, he's worried about dying.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:08.190
So he's obviously in a
very stressful situation.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.115
And he had the ability to do this.

00:30:11.115 --> 00:30:16.155
He could sit there and continue to
just dwell on what had happened, what

00:30:16.155 --> 00:30:20.475
negatively had happened, what negatively,
and this is so key, what negatively

00:30:20.925 --> 00:30:22.905
thing that God allowed to happen?

00:30:23.385 --> 00:30:26.175
Don't miss that part cuz some
of your negative thinking,

00:30:26.835 --> 00:30:27.856
you wanna blame God for.

00:30:28.635 --> 00:30:31.935
Here's the truth, maybe God did allow
something to happen for you to get to that

00:30:31.935 --> 00:30:36.225
point where the situation, you could think
negative, but David chose to do something

00:30:36.225 --> 00:30:38.565
else rather than be being negative.

00:30:38.565 --> 00:30:42.015
He chose to find his
strength in the Lord his God.

00:30:42.375 --> 00:30:46.355
And we see it as you look a little bit
deeper there in the Kjv version, which is,

00:30:46.635 --> 00:30:50.835
you know, the only real version for those
of you that love the K JV in verse six,

00:30:50.835 --> 00:30:52.395
this is really the way it's translated.

00:30:52.605 --> 00:30:55.395
But David encouraged himself in the Lord.

00:30:55.725 --> 00:30:58.274
But David encouraged himself in the Lord.

00:30:59.655 --> 00:31:05.745
So some of you are so negative of
yourself and those around you that you

00:31:05.745 --> 00:31:07.095
need to encourage yourself in the Lord.

00:31:08.355 --> 00:31:11.264
I'm gonna say that to myself, Ben,
sometimes, oh, wait, I, I don't

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:16.385
have a mirror, but sometimes I am
so negative about situations, about

00:31:16.575 --> 00:31:22.335
my life, about myself, that I need
to encourage myself from the Lord.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:23.970
Now, here's the interesting thing.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.970
It doesn't go on and explain how David
encouraged himself from the Lord.

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:27.780
That was all it really said.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.090
David encouraged himself from the
Lord and he began to seek the Lord.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.850
And there's more in this text where
he begins to seek the Lord and ask

00:31:32.855 --> 00:31:34.020
the prophet, what should he do?

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:34.680
And they go back.

00:31:34.685 --> 00:31:35.370
Here's the cool part.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.860
They go out and they begin
to catch up with this group.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.410
They get all our family back, and
they're all healthy and safe and fine.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:41.700
I think about this situation.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:47.400
God didn't leave for a moment when
these negative thoughts came in.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.900
God has always been present.

00:31:49.415 --> 00:31:50.640
He was present in their situation.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.250
He's present in whatever your
negative at, he's present.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.910
And David recognized that and he began
to encourage himself in the Lord.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.130
So yet we don't fully
know what David said.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:01.050
Here's the cool part, and you're
gonna see these verses and I

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.250
wanna read these verses with you.

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:06.630
Here's the cool part where we see some
of the verses that maybe David would've

00:32:06.635 --> 00:32:11.160
reminded himself of and encouraged
himself on the Lord that day, because

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.900
David wrote some of these psalms before.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.590
So we'll see these here.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:16.170
Psalm 1 0 3, 1 through five.

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:17.430
Again, all these are on the sheet.

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:19.710
I didn't have them put them on the
screen cuz I know you had the sheet.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.700
It says this, praise the Lord
my soul, all my inmost beam.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.050
Praise his holy name.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.190
Praise the Lord my soul.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.810
And forget not his benefits.

00:32:28.139 --> 00:32:31.350
Who forgives all your sins
and heals all your diseases.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.100
Who redeems your life from the pit and
crowns you with love and compassion.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.540
Who satisfies your desires with
good things, with good things.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.930
So maybe this is one of the
Psalms that David remembered.

00:32:43.395 --> 00:32:46.005
And then if we go on, we're
gonna see three different psalms,

00:32:46.275 --> 00:32:48.195
and there's a reason why that
they all sound very similar.

00:32:48.195 --> 00:32:52.665
So 1 0 3 8 1 45 8 and 86
15, this is what they say.

00:32:52.905 --> 00:32:55.695
It says, the Lord is
compassionate and gracious, slow

00:32:55.695 --> 00:32:57.405
to anger, abounding and love.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:00.750
And then he says, but you Lord
are compassionate and gracious

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:04.020
God, slow to anger and abounding
and love and faithfulness.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.990
And the other one is, the Lord
is gracious and compassionate,

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:09.210
slow to anger and rich and love.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:14.040
Why do you think that David wrote
in three different Psalms, these

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:23.610
same basic words, because he was
meditating on the word of God.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.740
God had given him these words.

00:33:26.235 --> 00:33:28.755
So what he did is he encouraged
himself from the Lord.

00:33:28.755 --> 00:33:32.955
He didn't allow all the
things going on around him to

00:33:32.955 --> 00:33:34.305
consume his negative thinking.

00:33:34.425 --> 00:33:35.955
No, it wasn't beneficial to him.

00:33:36.045 --> 00:33:38.595
He knew all it would
do was give him death.

00:33:39.195 --> 00:33:40.755
Death, and he didn't want death.

00:33:42.495 --> 00:33:46.875
He wanted life and peace,
so he encouraged himself in.

00:33:47.655 --> 00:33:49.425
The Lord and I love that.

00:33:49.665 --> 00:33:53.115
And he says, down here in Romans,
Romans 1513 says this, and this

00:33:53.115 --> 00:33:54.285
is just an encouragement for us.

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:57.705
May the God of hope fill you with
all joy and peace as you trust in

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:02.055
him, so that you may overflow with
hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

00:34:02.385 --> 00:34:06.575
It's a reminder of where we get our
hope and our peace from, which is Jesus.

00:34:07.515 --> 00:34:08.385
Which is Jesus.

00:34:10.005 --> 00:34:13.304
So when we think about David's
situation, when we think about all

00:34:13.304 --> 00:34:17.130
the reasons why we're negative,
I think we have to remember this.

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:18.660
Our perspective is limited.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.950
Our perspective is limited.

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:23.220
There's, there's a challenge in my
heart as a leader whenever we're,

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:25.680
I'm, I'm making decisions as a
church, we're making decisions

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:29.130
is, I know this, my perspective's
limited in this sit situation.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:34.890
So our situation with, with thinking
negatively, Is very limited, but

00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:37.230
God's perspective is not limited.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.330
He sees everything going on.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.570
He knows what's going on, and
he knows exactly what we need.

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:48.540
So as David reminded us that we need to
remember and be encouraged in the Lord,

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.670
I want to challenge you today that you
need to be encouraged in the L Lord.

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.670
And again, if you look at that
Psalm 1 0 3, David says, don't

00:34:56.670 --> 00:35:00.450
forget his benefits in the midst of.

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:04.575
The difficulty, just like I talked
earlier about my car, if I only look

00:35:04.575 --> 00:35:06.734
at the situation, it's only negative.

00:35:07.935 --> 00:35:12.075
But if I look past the situation
into God, God has provided a

00:35:12.075 --> 00:35:13.725
lot more than that situation.

00:35:14.475 --> 00:35:16.605
And I give that practical example
for you because I don't want you

00:35:16.609 --> 00:35:19.815
to just think, oh, well that's
just, you know, good thinking.

00:35:20.234 --> 00:35:21.915
No, it's practical thinking.

00:35:22.785 --> 00:35:24.735
Some of you came in here negative.

00:35:24.915 --> 00:35:28.185
Here's, here's the truth, I guarantee
it In a church our size, somebody

00:35:28.185 --> 00:35:34.365
came in here and there was something
between the coffee, the music that

00:35:34.365 --> 00:35:36.765
you didn't like, that you were
already thinking negative about.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:38.895
Don't, don't, don't lie to me.

00:35:40.275 --> 00:35:41.205
You may be sitting there right now.

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:42.225
This message is going too long.

00:35:42.225 --> 00:35:42.725
I'm already in the red.

00:35:43.315 --> 00:35:43.605
Okay?

00:35:46.634 --> 00:35:46.845
Yeah.

00:35:46.845 --> 00:35:47.654
I'm calling you out.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.970
Wanna know something, truth truthful.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.200
I woke up this morning in the first
five minutes of studying my message.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.320
I was negative, like I was a flat
out negative, and all of a sudden

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.080
it just like stopped in my tracks
and I went, what am I doing?

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:03.210
I'm preaching on this.

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:05.090
And I just thought like all these
negative thoughts about myself.

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:10.710
And I had to remind myself and encourage
myself and the Lord, even me on a Sunday

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.850
morning of preaching this message.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.780
I wrestle this.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.580
So this is not something we do once.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.020
This is something we do every day.

00:36:16.025 --> 00:36:18.090
So I want to give you a great, cool word.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:19.680
It's called ruminate.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:21.930
You've heard me maybe
mention this word before.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:22.560
Ruminate.

00:36:22.565 --> 00:36:25.890
Does anybody know what ruminating
is or know what Orville would?

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:26.760
Orville's gonna be the one.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:27.840
Okay, here.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.110
Good.

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:29.490
So let me kind of fill you in.

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:31.260
So ruminating, and I
want you to imagine this.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.670
This is gonna really make you exciting.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.170
Imagine a cow.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:41.115
Eating some grass and chewing on it and
swallowing it, got a lot of nutrients

00:36:41.115 --> 00:36:45.555
on it, and then they kinda like spit it
back up and they chew on it again because

00:36:45.555 --> 00:36:46.695
they wanna get more nutrients on it.

00:36:46.695 --> 00:36:50.685
So they're ruminating on this,
swallowing it again, and then they

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.085
spit it back up and they ruminate
again on it because they're wanting

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.305
the most nutrients out of it now.

00:36:55.875 --> 00:36:56.925
Now that's disgusting.

00:36:58.035 --> 00:36:59.205
So I don't want you throwing up.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.700
You know God's word all day just
to remind yourself not to, but

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.020
this is just a mental image.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:08.640
Is this idea, is it something that
we keep in us that we constantly

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.890
think on and we remind ourselves?

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.860
Son, whenever negative situations
come in, when you wanna be negative

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.380
at work, you wanna be negative at
your home, you wanna think negatively

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.030
as somebody else or yourself.

00:37:18.035 --> 00:37:20.310
Stop and remember, I gotta ruminate.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.390
This sounds really bad, bad.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:23.880
I need to encourage myself in the Lord.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.740
Where do we encourage
yourself in the Lord?

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:27.180
David went to the word.

00:37:28.155 --> 00:37:28.845
What do we do?

00:37:28.845 --> 00:37:30.255
We go to the word of God.

00:37:30.795 --> 00:37:31.935
I would even say this.

00:37:32.085 --> 00:37:33.015
Go to a friend.

00:37:33.465 --> 00:37:36.825
It's okay to shoot a text and
say, I need to be encouraged.

00:37:37.005 --> 00:37:38.085
I'm struggling today.

00:37:38.355 --> 00:37:40.845
Your friends are your
greatest resource sometimes of

00:37:40.845 --> 00:37:42.015
encouragement, cuz you know what?

00:37:42.285 --> 00:37:45.255
If you have the right friends, they're
gonna encourage you in the Lord.

00:37:45.825 --> 00:37:47.985
They're gonna encourage you in the Lord.

00:37:48.225 --> 00:37:52.035
So how do we overcome our negative
thoughts by taking our thoughts

00:37:52.035 --> 00:37:54.255
captive and acting more like a cow.

00:37:55.185 --> 00:37:55.965
Take that home with you.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.720
Maybe that'll stick for you.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:58.650
Maybe it won't.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.190
Okay.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:04.560
So as we move into imitation, cuz I want
to to take time, I want you to take time.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.150
I want you to be into thank today.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:10.200
What have I been very
negative about lately?

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.090
Has it been myself?

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:13.710
I want you to begin in
think through this, right?

00:38:13.715 --> 00:38:17.460
This is the time where you begin to start
thinking through if my thoughts have

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.670
incredible power of the direction of my
life, if they do, which I believe they

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:25.770
do, but you have incredible power over
your thoughts because God is with you.

00:38:26.799 --> 00:38:31.424
Then today you can lay down those
negative thoughts, those negative things

00:38:31.424 --> 00:38:35.205
that you've been worrying about as
assert yourself or about the church,

00:38:35.205 --> 00:38:39.944
or about your family, or about your
job, and you can begin to just say,

00:38:40.004 --> 00:38:42.285
okay, Lord, I'm ready to do battle.

00:38:43.125 --> 00:38:45.674
And what that means is that
you're going to begin to hand

00:38:45.674 --> 00:38:47.504
that over to the Lord, right?

00:38:47.895 --> 00:38:51.134
If your life has been full of negativity,
today is the day to deal with it.

00:38:51.375 --> 00:38:53.174
Don't let it drag you down
if you're tired of it.

00:38:53.234 --> 00:38:54.105
I, I'll tell you this.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.734
Being negative is exhausting,
and being around negative

00:38:57.734 --> 00:38:59.085
people is even more exhausting.

00:38:59.325 --> 00:39:01.694
And when you're the same person,
it's even really more exhausting.

00:39:01.815 --> 00:39:02.055
Okay.

00:39:02.745 --> 00:39:07.424
Um, and so maybe that's you today, and
if it's not you, then um, maybe it's

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:08.805
somebody else that you need to encourage.

00:39:09.225 --> 00:39:10.694
But as we take time today,
there's a couple of things

00:39:10.694 --> 00:39:11.805
that I wanna encourage you in.

00:39:12.165 --> 00:39:15.045
Uh, the first thing I just wanna do, I
want us to just take some time to pray.

00:39:15.495 --> 00:39:18.555
Um, And then I want to kind of
lead you through what you can

00:39:18.585 --> 00:39:19.695
be praying to the Lord about.

00:39:19.785 --> 00:39:20.325
So let's pray.

00:39:20.325 --> 00:39:22.815
Lord Jesus, your word is truth.

00:39:22.815 --> 00:39:25.305
And we know, Lord, that
your word is powerful.

00:39:25.305 --> 00:39:31.905
And I just pray that as we now begin
to process where we are in, in our

00:39:31.905 --> 00:39:35.785
lives, Lord, what areas maybe we're
being negative in, Lord, maybe it's

00:39:36.015 --> 00:39:39.075
ourselves or our friends, or our
family, or our job, or whatever it is.

00:39:39.075 --> 00:39:43.305
Lord, I pray that you begin to open
our hearts and minds today to what we

00:39:43.305 --> 00:39:45.825
need to lay down at your feet today.

00:39:47.265 --> 00:39:50.925
So as we continue to pray, I really
just want you right there at your seat.

00:39:51.345 --> 00:39:52.365
I just want you to bow your head.

00:39:52.365 --> 00:39:55.215
I want you to begin to just
think, okay, Lord, I'm gonna

00:39:55.215 --> 00:39:59.055
begin to just think through what
areas of my life, what are they?

00:39:59.685 --> 00:40:02.655
And I want you to just begin to
imagine them, and I want you to

00:40:02.655 --> 00:40:05.025
begin to lay them before the Lord
and say, Lord, here they are.

00:40:05.985 --> 00:40:09.055
I'm tired of being negative with
my family and our circumstances.

00:40:09.285 --> 00:40:11.835
I'm, I'm tired of being
negative towards myself.

00:40:12.735 --> 00:40:18.765
I, I'm tired of being negative
about my job or about the church,

00:40:18.795 --> 00:40:21.825
or about my spouse or my children.

00:40:23.355 --> 00:40:24.465
Just lay that down in his feet.

00:40:24.465 --> 00:40:28.605
And here's the great and amazing
part that as you are doing that the

00:40:28.605 --> 00:40:29.835
Lord has been there the whole time.

00:40:30.335 --> 00:40:31.455
And you know what he's gonna do?

00:40:31.455 --> 00:40:35.175
He's gonna take that whatever you
lay down at his feet, he's gonna

00:40:35.175 --> 00:40:37.515
take that and he is gonna remove it.

00:40:38.235 --> 00:40:41.759
And so I just want you to imagine as
you're laying that down, I want you to

00:40:41.759 --> 00:40:47.669
just imagine that Jesus is taking that
and he's removing it from your life,

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.020
and what I want you to do is something
that I think is so important.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.490
We see this all throughout his word.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:00.750
I want you to begin to praise and
faith maybe before that, all of those

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:02.049
things that you are negative about.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.899
I want you to begin to praise in
faith that the Lord has removed

00:41:06.899 --> 00:41:08.729
them and that you will begin.

00:41:10.904 --> 00:41:12.345
Encouraging yourself in the Lord.

00:41:13.035 --> 00:41:18.194
So just take some time to praise
God and to take some time to thank

00:41:18.194 --> 00:41:21.825
him that his benefits are amazing.

00:41:22.665 --> 00:41:24.555
Thank him that he is an encourager.

00:41:26.055 --> 00:41:30.615
Begin to just thank him that he has
one that takes our burdens from us

00:41:31.694 --> 00:41:33.134
and removes them from our lives.

00:41:35.444 --> 00:41:38.535
I want you to just thank them for
dying in your place on the cross.

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:56.730
The last thing I want you to think through
is you're sitting there in your seats.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.160
I want you just there.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.070
There could be somebody in this room
that doesn't know Jesus, and so when

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:04.770
you're saying cast all your cares
on him, you, you don't know what

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:06.060
that means and what that looks like.

00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:10.365
And I just wanna challenge you today
as you're continuing to pray, as if

00:42:10.365 --> 00:42:15.794
you need to give your life to Jesus
that today is the day of salvation.

00:42:17.504 --> 00:42:20.515
To give your life to him, to repent of
your sins and say, I need you, Jesus.

00:42:21.495 --> 00:42:26.265
And said that you can do that right where
you sit and the quietness of your prayer.

00:42:26.265 --> 00:42:27.585
Just say, I need Jesus.

00:42:27.944 --> 00:42:29.294
Forgive me of my sins.

00:42:29.475 --> 00:42:30.435
I trust in you.

00:42:31.335 --> 00:42:32.535
You can say that right now.

00:42:33.105 --> 00:42:34.785
You can say, I surrender my life to you.

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:43.230
You can admit your need for his mercy
and grace in your life, forgiveness.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.640
And if you've prayed that prayer and
if you've surrendered that to him

00:42:47.645 --> 00:42:52.350
today, then you have given your life
to him and we celebrate with you.

00:42:56.070 --> 00:43:00.270
So Lord Jesus, we just pray today, Lord,
as we stand in worship here in a minute.

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:03.150
Lord, I pray that we
worship with less burden.

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:11.565
We, we get rid of all of our negative
thinking, not because, Lord, you know,

00:43:11.565 --> 00:43:15.045
it's something that makes us right with
you in the fact that it, you know, you

00:43:15.045 --> 00:43:18.045
don't love us before, Lord, you love
us no matter what we're going through.

00:43:18.045 --> 00:43:21.375
But Lord, I know that what you're
saying is that negativity and our

00:43:21.404 --> 00:43:23.235
lives is not beneficial for us, Lord.

00:43:23.895 --> 00:43:28.725
So I pray that we have casted our cares
on you, our negativities, and everything

00:43:28.725 --> 00:43:30.285
that we're dealing with onto your feet.

00:43:30.705 --> 00:43:32.805
And now, Lord, I pray that
you have removed all that.

00:43:33.645 --> 00:43:37.005
And then we can now praise freely
because of what you've done for

00:43:37.005 --> 00:43:39.195
us on the cross and what you've
done for us in this moment.

00:43:40.275 --> 00:43:43.365
But Lord Jesus, I pray that if there's
someone in this room that may be during

00:43:43.365 --> 00:43:46.845
that time of, of praying, Lord, that
they gave their lives to you, Lord, I

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:49.545
pray that at the end of this service
that they come and find me and they

00:43:49.545 --> 00:43:51.826
say, Hey, I've given my life to Jesus.

00:43:52.135 --> 00:43:56.715
I've casted my cares upon
him and will celebrate Lord.

00:43:56.715 --> 00:43:58.305
I pray that you give them
the faith to do that.

00:43:59.475 --> 00:44:01.185
So Lord, be with us this week as we.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:09.630
Begin to remember you as we begin
to pursue you and as we begin to

00:44:09.635 --> 00:44:13.500
overcome our negative thinking, and
we pray this in your heavenly name.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:14.550
Amen.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.830
All right, let's stand and let's worship.
