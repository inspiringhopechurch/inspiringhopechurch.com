00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.760
Hey I'm so this is always the fun part.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.060
So you see a worship
service and like it's crazy.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.310
We got half our churches like kids.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.110
Um, I would say our median age
has gotta be like 17, maybe

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.760
not that low, but it's okay.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.040
Um, but I, again, we, we love.

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:23.205
Kids, we love families.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:25.395
Um, this is a great place to welcome that.

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:27.645
Yes, it's a little bit chaotic,
but I look at that as just kind of

00:00:27.854 --> 00:00:29.384
where you, you look at that's life.

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:30.765
I mean, we all do life that way.

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:33.705
So I just, I love it.

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:37.364
So whatever the kids do dismiss, you're
like, wait, there's a lot of seats.

00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:39.825
So if you need to move
around, feel comfortable.

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:44.025
Um, one of the things we try to create
here at inspiring hope is a very

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:47.055
casual atmosphere, um, too many times.

00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:48.465
And again, this is not,
I'm not gonna anybody else.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:50.985
This is just how God's really
burdened our heart, who we need to be.

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:56.129
Um, Too many times we think
about religion as some sort of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.250
like rigid structural thing.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.519
And again, for some, that's fine if that's
who you are, but for us, it's like, man,

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.160
just let on your hair come as you are.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.600
Honestly, all of us have probably
had some form of just difficult

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.250
week or difficult moments.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.520
We come here broken a lot
of times, be real be you.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.280
Um, this is where we're here to
lift each other up, building.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.270
So when I say like casual, like
we, we give five minutes in

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.520
the middle of service as kids
transition out for you to hang out.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.730
We don't want you to rush out the
door after service because you just

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.480
really want to get out of here.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.170
We want you to hang out.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.300
Cause you're like, Hey man, I
want to talk to this person.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.850
I want to catch up with them
and hear how they're doing.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.260
And like for our team, we get here.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.410
A lot of times our core team gets here
at nine and we circle up and we just,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.520
Hey, what do we need to pray for?

00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:40.304
What's been going on.

00:01:40.304 --> 00:01:41.175
How can I encourage him?

00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:44.505
You know, many times there's usually
somebody, if not multiple people that have

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:48.855
had rough weeks and we're just here to
minister, we're here to love and support.

00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:52.905
So as a church, we're going to
continue to be just who we are.

00:01:53.085 --> 00:01:53.385
Right.

00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:56.085
We're we're not here to make
sure that things go perfect.

00:01:56.445 --> 00:01:58.275
Cause I don't think God's
looking for perfection.

00:01:58.275 --> 00:02:00.495
That's why he sent us on
Jesus to be perfect for us.

00:02:00.884 --> 00:02:02.215
He's looking for honesty and.

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:03.825
That's who we are.

00:02:03.855 --> 00:02:05.205
So I want to continue that today.

00:02:05.205 --> 00:02:06.585
That's why you heard some testimony today.

00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:11.175
I'm going to briefly share
with you a word and a message.

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:12.285
Um, and I'm going to keep it brief.

00:02:12.285 --> 00:02:14.805
Most pastors say brief, and the next
thing, you know, 45 minutes later,

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:17.325
but I'm really gonna try to keep this
at 20 minutes so that we can hear

00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:20.025
more people share about what God's
done in their life or last year.

00:02:20.445 --> 00:02:24.585
Um, but this word faithfulness
has been on my heart and mind

00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:26.295
over the last year faithfulness.

00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:29.475
And it's like, God reminds me of
this faithfulness faithfulness.

00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:32.685
And so today I'm going to give you the
scripture here where we're going to be at.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:33.795
We're going to be in limitations.

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:37.725
That's a big word limitations,
chapter three, verses 22 through 24.

00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:38.895
If you don't have a Bible, it's okay.

00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:39.945
We're going to have it behind me.

00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:44.745
Um, if you don't have a Bible and you
want one great go to an app store,

00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:46.905
um, I use the YouVersion Bible app.

00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:48.105
It's one of my favorite Bible apps.

00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:54.270
I get so many great, um, uh, Devotionals
out of those, um, the scriptures there.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.910
So you can pull that up if you want
to, but we're going to be reading that

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.920
today, but again, this word faithfulness.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.530
So I started looking at it a little
bit more in detail this week.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.340
The word faithful is to remain loyal
and steadfast, consistent and committed,

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.230
never giving up, never backing down,
showing up every day, see this past

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.850
year I've needed the word faithful.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.350
Um, just thinking back personally,
again, we'll look, get rid of

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.280
the ministry side of things.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.820
Think about personally, there's been
some tough circumstances personally

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.850
in my life, and I know many of you
have had those same things, right?

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.210
Where were things mentally,
physically, spiritually just were

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.160
not right, but God was faithful.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.109
And I continue to stay faithful to
what he had called me to, despite

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.029
our circumstances at inspiring hope.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.420
When we launched this church, wondering
what God was going to do, how he was

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.910
going to reach people, how are we
going to minister to our community?

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.410
How are we going to serve our community?

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.109
I had no clue in the midst of that.

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.250
God was faithful and we were
faithful to speak concerning.

00:03:54.595 --> 00:03:56.665
Despite all the unknowns
we have going forward.

00:03:56.665 --> 00:03:58.975
And if you haven't been a part
of this church, there's a lot of

00:03:58.975 --> 00:04:00.085
unknowns in the next three months.

00:04:00.085 --> 00:04:02.125
We're looking for a new facility
because we'll be out of this one.

00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:03.475
I don't know where that's going to be.

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:05.935
We're talking about doing some
different things within our community

00:04:05.935 --> 00:04:07.255
that are way bigger than who we are.

00:04:07.435 --> 00:04:08.695
We don't know how that's going to happen.

00:04:09.355 --> 00:04:10.195
Here's the cool part.

00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:12.175
God will be faithful.

00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:14.635
Sam reminded over and over again.

00:04:14.695 --> 00:04:20.065
God's past faithfulness gives me
confidence and God's faithfulness now.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.260
And his faithfulness in the future.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.100
I'm going to say that again.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.140
God's past faithfulness.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.330
Give me constant confidence today of
his presence, present faithfulness

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.890
and his future faithfulness.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.560
That is why we are standing here today.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.650
That's why I'm having people share
testimonies, there's power and remembering

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.630
because when God has so changed your life.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.440
You have to tell somebody
you have to share it.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.830
And so it was so many of you we've
shared over and over again, how God

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.170
has been faithful in our lives, how God
has shown up when nothing else, we, we

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.870
didn't know what we were going to do,
but God has shown up and been faithful.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.490
And that is exactly why we're here today.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.990
That's why we exactly, we're
going to continue to move

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.180
forward because God is faithful.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.380
And so we see in this text, a couple
different things, but I want to share with

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.994
you in this idea of faithful, Is that God
desires to do exceedingly abundantly more

00:05:10.994 --> 00:05:12.765
than we can ask or think according to the.

00:05:13.665 --> 00:05:14.325
In us, right?

00:05:14.325 --> 00:05:18.075
According to the power that works in us,
that's Ephesians chapter three, verse 20.

00:05:18.465 --> 00:05:21.405
And because I'm reminded that the God,
in these two words, if you're a teacher

00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:25.485
in here, these two are big words,
exceedingly abundantly, more than we

00:05:25.485 --> 00:05:30.135
can ask or think that's why everyday
we go into prayer and we say, Lord, we

00:05:30.165 --> 00:05:32.235
ask that you do exceedingly abundantly.

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.485
We're really just praying scripture
of what he's already promised.

00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:37.155
Exceedingly abundantly more than we
can ask or think through the work

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:38.835
that you plan to do through us.

00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:39.085
And.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.070
So God desires to be more and the
lie, our lives and this, our city as

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.450
we move forward in the days ahead.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.690
And so I want to wanted to
share this as we move forward.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.420
My challenge is to remain faithful.

00:05:52.245 --> 00:05:54.165
Because God is always faithful.

00:05:54.465 --> 00:05:55.785
So let's read these verses together.

00:05:55.785 --> 00:05:59.235
Again, limitations, chapter
three, verses 23 through 24.

00:05:59.235 --> 00:06:02.295
It says this because of
the Lord's faithful love.

00:06:02.775 --> 00:06:05.745
We do not perish for his mercies.

00:06:05.895 --> 00:06:08.505
Never end they're new every morning.

00:06:09.015 --> 00:06:09.555
Great.

00:06:09.555 --> 00:06:10.605
Is your faithfulness?

00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:12.945
I say the Lord is my portion.

00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:15.045
Therefore, I will put my hope.

00:06:17.265 --> 00:06:21.255
See, we see God's faithful, love and
mercy because of God's faithful love.

00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:22.335
We will not perish.

00:06:23.085 --> 00:06:25.575
So sort of looking at
this, God is faithful.

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:26.625
Why is God faithful?

00:06:26.625 --> 00:06:27.915
Because of his sacrificial love.

00:06:27.915 --> 00:06:29.985
He did everything for us.

00:06:30.105 --> 00:06:32.835
We didn't have to do anything,
guided everything for us to extend

00:06:32.835 --> 00:06:35.055
his love and his mercy to us.

00:06:35.205 --> 00:06:37.905
What is mercy not giving
us what we deserve.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.020
Now giving us what we deserve.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.010
What do we decide?

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.239
Well, I've mentioned this early.

00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:44.070
We usually come in here broken people.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.090
That isn't mean like we're bad people
in the fact of like, we're useless,

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.349
but broken means that we, we are
mending we're consistently healing.

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:52.979
We're consistently.

00:06:53.645 --> 00:06:57.365
Really, as I would say, challenging each
other to, to really just, I would say

00:06:57.365 --> 00:07:01.175
deal with what we have a lot of times
the difficult situations and in the

00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:06.005
midst of that brokenness God's mercy is
present, which means rather than judging

00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:10.865
us for that condition, he actually
comes to save us from that condition.

00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:14.165
And that's the one thing we talk
about, God, God is not a God.

00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:15.905
That's just sitting here angry and mad.

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:17.135
God is a God of love.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.540
And mercy, the desires for you to know
him and know his patience and his peace

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.190
and his love and his grace and his mercy
and everything that he gifts to us.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.920
So God's faithfulness never ends.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.030
So when I ask this question, if you
have kids, if you don't, you probably

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.500
remember this as a kid, do you give your
kids mercy or did your parents ever give

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.940
you mercy when you did something wrong?

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.160
Which means they didn't
give you what you deserve.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:41.640
Punishment.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.030
Anybody you may have grown up with
parents that just never gave you mercy.

00:07:46.545 --> 00:07:49.365
But I know this, that,
because I love my kids.

00:07:49.395 --> 00:07:51.015
There's times where I extend mercy.

00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:52.725
See, here's the cool part.

00:07:53.355 --> 00:07:57.255
There's not a time where God
doesn't extend mercy to us

00:07:57.885 --> 00:07:59.895
when we recognize our need for.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.729
He extends it over and
over and over again.

00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:06.180
And this is what this verse says
because of his faithful love.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.580
We will not perish for his mercies.

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:10.800
Never end God has never changed.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.669
This is the cool part, guys.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.409
God has never changed from the beginning.

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:16.050
God created us because he desired
to have a relationship with us.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.210
In the beginning, there
was a perfect relationship.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.900
God desired for that to continue
forever and ever, and ever

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:23.549
until it was broken by all.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.800
Sin by our brokenness.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.970
And here's what God did.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.680
God, didn't just leave us
in that brokenness and say,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.790
Hey, I'm done with you.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.870
Here's what he said.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.460
I still desire to have
a relationship with you.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.550
So I'm going to do anything I can to
mend that relationship so that you

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.140
can have a relationship with me again.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.400
See, that's beautiful because
God's mercies extend forever.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.970
So God loved us so much
that he sent his son Jesus.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.510
And so I sit here and think about this
over this past year, myself, uh, many of

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.560
us can look back knowing without God's
faithful, love and mercy, we would have.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.960
As a church and as individuals, but
because, because God has been faithful

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.060
and because God has extended his mercy,
we have been able to be successful.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.170
Not that it was easy.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.020
We talked about this this morning
as a group at nine o'clock.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.910
There's actually been a lot
of difficult situations.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.200
And a lot of our families, it's not been
easy as a church to minister the way we

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.520
would want to in the community, but God
has been faithful because see that next

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.270
first, when I started hearing started
thinking, so what about God going forward?

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.610
As well.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.360
And then I looked at verse 23 and I'm
just going to kind of reverse 22 into

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.580
23, says for his mercies, never end.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.100
They are new every morning.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:32.880
Great.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.870
Is your faithfulness.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.439
So God's faithfulness is
given to us every single day.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.780
Here's another great question.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.260
Anybody here needed a great
night arrest, just knowing I just

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.160
needed a great night of rest.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.150
That tomorrow will be.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.010
You all have had those bad days,
just get me to bed because I

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.180
need tomorrow to happen today.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:51.900
It needs to be over.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.610
See, this is the cool part with God.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:10:01.350
Every day, every day, God's mercies are
new and given to us they're new every

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.910
morning and they don't run out God over
and over again, meets us at our worst.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.230
He picks us up.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.050
He does us off and he says, I choose you.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.840
I choose you every morning.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.030
That's what God does when
he extends his mercy.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.660
See great is his faithfulness.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.550
God's mercy never runs out.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.860
And that challenges me every day.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.910
So even, and you guys know you've
heard this song before, and if I

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.100
had a good voice at all, I would
sing it, but I'm not going to.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.360
So I'm just going to
read some of the lyrics.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.310
This is what I was reminding myself up.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.980
So even when I don't see it, he's
working, even when I don't feel it

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.620
he's working, he never gives up.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.510
Never lets us down.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.450
Yes, God will be with us in the future.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.950
Yes, God.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.590
With his great faithfulness
will continue to be with us.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:50.610
So here's the question.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.080
Where do we go from here as a church?

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.060
What's our next step as a church.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.170
And I love how this, this verse, this
next verse really points us as a church

00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.850
and as individuals to go forward.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.350
This is what he says in verse 24.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.960
He says, I say, the Lord is my portion.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.490
Therefore, I will put my hope in.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.550
What does the word portion mean?

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.430
It really means inheritance
the Lord is my inheritance.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.810
So those of us that have a hope in
Jesus can go forward saying no matter

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:20.880
what lies before us, our inheritance
is in Jesus, everything he has.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.760
Let me just share with you some of the
things that Jesus has that we get to

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.339
inherit as sons and daughters of Jesus.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.980
Hope, love, peace, mercy,
grace, forgiveness, heaven,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.780
friendships, community.

00:11:35.085 --> 00:11:37.545
Over and over again, God
continues to give this to us.

00:11:37.575 --> 00:11:41.085
As we put our hope in him, we cannot
put our hope in worldly things.

00:11:41.085 --> 00:11:42.525
Here's what I'll guarantee
to tell you this.

00:11:42.765 --> 00:11:45.735
Every single time that I try to put my
hope in money, it seems like I have less.

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:48.445
I'm just telling you I
do every single time.

00:11:48.585 --> 00:11:50.145
I want to put my hope in my health.

00:11:50.565 --> 00:11:54.255
There is no guarantee because tomorrow
that can change every time I want

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:57.285
to put my hope in everything that
I can do and work as hard as I can.

00:11:57.465 --> 00:11:59.025
I'm telling you guys, I'm a hard worker.

00:11:59.025 --> 00:11:59.805
I love to work.

00:11:59.805 --> 00:12:00.585
I love tasks.

00:12:00.765 --> 00:12:03.405
I love being able to put everything
in my control and every single time.

00:12:05.459 --> 00:12:06.150
It lets me down.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.680
Eventually it lets me down.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.470
But with Jesus, if I put my hope in him
and if we do as a church, put our hope

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.770
in him, we will inherit what he has.

00:12:17.565 --> 00:12:20.085
He has experienced eternity with God.

00:12:20.385 --> 00:12:23.265
And he has promised that with us, but
he's also experienced, this is the guest.

00:12:23.265 --> 00:12:25.125
I'm just telling you this
challenges me every day.

00:12:25.305 --> 00:12:27.675
I want you to go to heaven
one day and that's that.

00:12:27.675 --> 00:12:28.935
I want to continue to tell you this.

00:12:28.935 --> 00:12:31.665
If you put your faith and hope in
Jesus, you will go to heaven one day,

00:12:31.845 --> 00:12:35.055
but it's, there's so much more we're
missing about the presence of God.

00:12:35.055 --> 00:12:38.805
Now, now God is so changed my life.

00:12:38.835 --> 00:12:39.345
Now.

00:12:39.915 --> 00:12:42.525
That's why I'm crazy enough to
move to Ohio, to start a church.

00:12:44.175 --> 00:12:45.225
I'm just being honest.

00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:48.345
I mean, like there would've
been no other reason to be here.

00:12:50.885 --> 00:12:52.715
That doesn't mean I don't
like y'all I really do.

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:56.495
I mean, God's so changed my life
that he actually says, like,

00:12:56.495 --> 00:13:00.095
he's put in my heart that really,
this more than like, I love you.

00:13:00.245 --> 00:13:02.345
And you may say, oh, I'm new here today.

00:13:02.825 --> 00:13:05.285
You don't know how much
I've been praying for you.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Oh, God, I prayed and prayed.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.380
And here's what we, we prayed.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.540
We say, God do not send us from here.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.380
We were in Oklahoma.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.170
This is before we knew we were
even coming to Cincinnati.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.530
We said, God, do not send us if
your presence doesn't go before us.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.300
Because if your presence
doesn't go, we don't want to go.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.040
No, we're not going.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.480
And here's what God did.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.439
He promised his presence and we would
take another step of faith and he promised

00:13:30.439 --> 00:13:31.939
his presence in that step and hit.

00:13:31.939 --> 00:13:33.020
It was amazing to see that.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.730
Eh, there was not an easy path.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.480
It was usually steps of faith and knowing,
I don't know what you're doing, God.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.020
And then God would show up and then
there'd be something else that would

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.070
show up and we'd be like, what?

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:44.820
God, can you move here?

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.540
And here's what he would say.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.380
Do you trust me here?

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:47.760
Do you trust me here?

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.260
And this is the something that I shared
with Brittany recently, as we're continued

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.020
to walk through things, it's we got
here and it's still not been easy.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.250
She was asking just why this and
why that, and I just said, well,

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.420
maybe this is what God's saying.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:01.260
Do you trust.

00:14:02.835 --> 00:14:05.655
Do you trust me in, in this
area of your life and over and

00:14:05.655 --> 00:14:06.945
over again, we have to say yes.

00:14:07.215 --> 00:14:12.225
And every single time we do, God shows up
over and over again, over and over again.

00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:17.355
Here's what I know I've been.

00:14:17.385 --> 00:14:19.755
And again, if you haven't been here
lately, but I've been completely honest

00:14:19.755 --> 00:14:23.925
with you guys lately about this idea of
struggle over control, going forward for

00:14:23.925 --> 00:14:26.655
inspiring hope, because I love control.

00:14:26.835 --> 00:14:28.935
I love knowing the future.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.290
But I've come to realize I don't,
because I do know, I don't know the

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:39.270
feature, but the one that I do know in
Jesus does, and he's never let me down.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.700
So going forward, this
is what this verse says.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.370
He says, the Lord is my
portion or my inheritance.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.590
Therefore I will put my hope in him.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.760
Here's my challenge.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.140
As a church, we will, we will put
our hope in Jesus going forward.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:52.620
No one else.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.020
I'll tell you this.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.760
We have a very gifted group of people
in this church that love Jesus that

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.699
serve amazingly, but I'm not even
putting my hope in their talents.

00:15:03.599 --> 00:15:07.500
I'm putting my hope and the faith
that they have in Jesus, because

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.510
that is the reason why we are here.

00:15:09.569 --> 00:15:11.790
That is the reason why we
are doing what we're doing.

00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:14.610
And that's why I'll stay in here
every day in everything that I

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.430
do and say it's because of Jesus,
because Jesus has so changed.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.730
I have to remember that
God's word is truth.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.670
That God has been faithful in the past,
and he's been faithful in the past.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.270
He'll be faithful.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.770
Now he'll be faithful in the future.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.270
My hope is in Jesus because he has
changed my life and he has been faithful.

00:15:30.719 --> 00:15:33.390
And I started thinking about this,
and again, this is another song I'm

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.579
going to kind of sing it a little bit
different way, and I'm not going to sing.

00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:37.650
I'm actually just to share the words
cause my voice would be horrible.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:42.120
Great is God's faithfulness
greatest his faithfulness

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.969
morning by morning, his mercies.

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:50.295
All I have needed is his hand
has provided great is his

00:15:50.295 --> 00:15:52.335
faithfulness to me and to you.

00:15:54.305 --> 00:15:58.025
Why can I stay in here and say
that God is faithful, that God

00:15:58.025 --> 00:15:59.045
will continue to be faithful?

00:15:59.074 --> 00:15:59.585
Why?

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.715
Because all the things
that God has prepared.

00:16:01.715 --> 00:16:05.585
So I want to just briefly share my
part of celebrating what God has done.

00:16:05.585 --> 00:16:08.944
And then I'm going to let more of you
share today because I want you guys to.

00:16:10.064 --> 00:16:10.875
What God has done.

00:16:10.905 --> 00:16:13.605
We share our testimonies because we
want to give glory to God, but we also

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:16.454
want to be reminded ourselves what God
has done and what he's going to do.

00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:17.625
How can I stay in here?

00:16:17.625 --> 00:16:19.875
Because God has shown
up in our family's life.

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:22.665
This journey for us did start
more than just a year ago.

00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:26.145
It started really in 2018, when we
had a spiritual discontent, what I

00:16:26.145 --> 00:16:29.415
would say this has God was moving in
our lives, but we didn't want to move.

00:16:29.954 --> 00:16:33.765
It was a life of change where it was
difficult to process that we could

00:16:33.765 --> 00:16:36.675
do anything different than what
we were doing in Oklahoma, but God

00:16:36.675 --> 00:16:40.455
was throwing us and he says, okay,
You, you have something different.

00:16:40.455 --> 00:16:41.235
How do you, so what do we do?

00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:43.935
We started just praying Lord
rebuilt, where we would go.

00:16:43.935 --> 00:16:45.435
And so that was 2019 for us.

00:16:45.675 --> 00:16:47.085
God, where do you want us to go?

00:16:48.165 --> 00:16:51.015
And it was, we came to Cincinnati
and goddess Drew's to this area,

00:16:51.015 --> 00:16:52.755
and then we were drawn to Hamilton.

00:16:52.935 --> 00:16:56.595
And I remember in that moment telling our
church and looking and saying, we just

00:16:56.595 --> 00:16:57.885
said, we're going to go plant a church.

00:16:57.885 --> 00:16:58.995
And we have zero funding.

00:16:58.995 --> 00:17:00.495
We just bought a house eight months ago.

00:17:00.495 --> 00:17:01.935
We have nobody going with us.

00:17:02.145 --> 00:17:03.495
We don't know how this is going to work.

00:17:03.825 --> 00:17:04.875
And here's what God said.

00:17:04.875 --> 00:17:05.205
Do you trust.

00:17:06.044 --> 00:17:08.145
And we did we trust the
God we move forward.

00:17:08.145 --> 00:17:10.665
You would think that guy would have
just shown up, but no, it's early August

00:17:10.665 --> 00:17:12.704
of 2019, we still have no funding.

00:17:12.704 --> 00:17:13.694
Our house still hasn't sold.

00:17:13.694 --> 00:17:16.304
We haven't passed assessment to become
church planners and we're supposed

00:17:16.304 --> 00:17:17.774
to be in Cincinnati in four months.

00:17:18.044 --> 00:17:18.764
What do we do?

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:20.655
Do we trust God there?

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:22.095
And here's what God did.

00:17:22.304 --> 00:17:22.905
God showed up.

00:17:22.935 --> 00:17:23.625
He sold our house.

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:24.524
We passed assessment.

00:17:24.645 --> 00:17:29.385
We raised the first portion of our funding
to get here to, we had to raise funds and

00:17:29.385 --> 00:17:31.605
we showed up here day after Christmas.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:32.685
Saying.

00:17:32.685 --> 00:17:33.225
Okay.

00:17:33.285 --> 00:17:35.055
2019, here we go.

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:37.065
We're going to go into 2020
and y'all know what happened.

00:17:37.095 --> 00:17:39.345
2020 showed up and here's what God said.

00:17:39.465 --> 00:17:40.455
Do you trust me here?

00:17:41.325 --> 00:17:45.075
I remember in the middle of a lockdown,
we're going, what the heck are we doing?

00:17:45.975 --> 00:17:46.695
What are we doing?

00:17:46.845 --> 00:17:50.294
And here was the cool part in the middle
of a pandemic basically is this started.

00:17:50.504 --> 00:17:53.475
We have a family from Oklahoma that
said, Hey, we're moving out here.

00:17:53.475 --> 00:17:55.875
Riley had already said
she was coming out here.

00:17:55.875 --> 00:17:57.254
And we're like, okay, we got 10.

00:17:57.705 --> 00:17:58.695
And you know what we did the Lord.

00:17:58.695 --> 00:18:00.195
We're like, 10 is not enough.

00:18:00.885 --> 00:18:03.465
You guys know that ocean's
11 moment where he looks over

00:18:03.465 --> 00:18:04.395
and he says, do we need more?

00:18:04.425 --> 00:18:05.235
Do we need one more?

00:18:05.715 --> 00:18:06.705
I think we need one more.

00:18:06.915 --> 00:18:08.715
We were like, we need
lot more than this Lord.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.690
And so what did the Lord
do slowly over time?

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.520
In 2020, he began to add one family.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.480
After another, after another, we began
meeting our home to a point of our home

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.450
was full of kids and you guys know summer.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.390
And a lot of kids, there was a lot
of stank going on in our basement.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.190
We had to really sanitize it down.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.555
All I say to that as God was faithful,
but then we got to the end of 2, 20,

00:18:30.555 --> 00:18:32.400
20, 20, and we said, okay, it's 2021.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.450
We're going to go launch this church.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.020
Let's go.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.460
Obviously it was the first three weeks.

00:18:36.555 --> 00:18:37.545
Into 2021.

00:18:37.545 --> 00:18:40.965
We were all quarantine with COVID
over three weeks, three weeks.

00:18:40.965 --> 00:18:41.655
We didn't get to meet.

00:18:41.655 --> 00:18:42.345
We met online.

00:18:42.795 --> 00:18:43.095
Okay.

00:18:43.095 --> 00:18:44.925
God, what are you doing?

00:18:45.135 --> 00:18:46.004
God was faithful.

00:18:46.335 --> 00:18:48.495
I remember when I called each one
of our core team members and I

00:18:48.495 --> 00:18:51.405
said, I sensed that God has told
me this morning that we need to go.

00:18:52.004 --> 00:18:52.815
It's time to go.

00:18:52.815 --> 00:18:54.165
We have two months before Easter.

00:18:54.165 --> 00:18:55.395
Let's try to figure this out.

00:18:55.395 --> 00:18:56.325
This space was unfair.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.070
We had to get the, the, we
actually, I don't even know if

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.300
we had a space guaranteed yet.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.460
We didn't have a space guaranteed.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.610
We got the space guaranteed.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.250
Basically at that point, we got the
floors, finished, the walls done.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.600
We hung up a couple of things.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.590
We got some things ordered and
we came up here and started

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.550
Easter Sunday, figured it out.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.800
But then we started saying, oh
God, what are you gonna do now?

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:17.370
You know, there's only 30 of us
and slowly grabbing an ad people.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.490
I say all this to say, I'm going to
stop with that story there because

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:21.450
there's more, people's going to share.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.379
What's happened over the last year.

00:19:24.284 --> 00:19:25.305
God has been faithful.

00:19:25.305 --> 00:19:27.405
That word will continue to
go with me into this year.

00:19:28.425 --> 00:19:30.495
God has shown up over and over again.

00:19:30.495 --> 00:19:34.215
And you guys are part
of God's faithfulness.

00:19:35.055 --> 00:19:37.065
I know that you may be a guest
in this room and you're sitting

00:19:37.065 --> 00:19:38.655
there going what I'm a part of.

00:19:38.655 --> 00:19:43.875
God's say absolutely because I prayed
for you because many people prayed for

00:19:43.875 --> 00:19:47.235
you to be a part of what God's doing
in the city to transform the city, to

00:19:47.235 --> 00:19:52.955
show the love of Jesus, to serve and
to show them who God is like, God.

00:19:54.455 --> 00:19:57.785
And I'm so glad that we've got to be a
part of this and going forward that we're

00:19:57.785 --> 00:19:58.775
going to continue to be a part of this.

00:19:58.775 --> 00:20:02.555
So God's faithfulness in the past gives me
the confidence of his faithfulness today

00:20:02.735 --> 00:20:04.205
and the faithfulness and the feature.

00:20:04.325 --> 00:20:06.815
And I want to continue to celebrate
what God's over the last year, by

00:20:06.815 --> 00:20:09.845
giving more people the opportunity to
share what God's done in their life.

00:20:09.845 --> 00:20:12.785
So I've asked my wife to start us off.

00:20:13.115 --> 00:20:15.965
Um, and again, we're going to go for about
as long as everybody wants to share mine.

00:20:17.129 --> 00:20:18.480
I told her this earlier.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.889
Um, here's my goal today, guys,
every single time that you give

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:25.470
a testimony, this is really just
giving your breath back to God.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:28.200
It's really just recognizing what
God's done in your life, what

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.310
God has done through our church.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.730
Um, and so as you guys share, uh,
my encouragement share for one to

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.780
two minutes, if you just get on a
rant and go for 10, just ask for

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.129
forgiveness up front when you share.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:38.639
Okay.

00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:41.010
But we're gonna try to keep this
one to two minutes and we'll go as

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.190
long as everybody's done Sharon,
and then, um, we'll finish up.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.700
So go ahead.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.330
Hey, he didn't ask me to
go first, but it's fine.

00:20:49.169 --> 00:20:55.439
Um, so, um, Ben kind of settled and
so I was like, what did he not say?

00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:00.929
Um, but, uh, whenever I was thinking
about what I wanted to share today, um,

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.179
I was thinking just about a couple of
highlights through there's so much guys.

00:21:06.209 --> 00:21:11.760
So, um, the things that
came to mind were, um, and.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.310
The coolest things that we've seen is
we've seen two couples, husband, and

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.350
wife both give their lives to Jesus.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.530
And, um, that's been really cool.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:30.240
Um, and then, uh, back in September,
um, well, even before that, but

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.800
back in September, um, I started a
discipleship group for our women, our

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.450
core team, um, ladies and the Lord
had been pressing that on my heart.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:46.155
Um, Hey, we, I mean, that is what our
Christian walks are about is being like

00:21:46.185 --> 00:21:48.104
being discipled and discipling others.

00:21:48.735 --> 00:21:51.405
Um, and so he really
pressed that on my heart.

00:21:51.405 --> 00:21:53.264
And I was like, no, God, I
don't have time for that.

00:21:53.264 --> 00:21:58.004
I have four kids, like a homeschool,
like we're planting this church.

00:21:58.034 --> 00:21:59.354
Like just, I don't have time for that.

00:21:59.354 --> 00:22:02.145
And then God said I was willing
to do because I created time.

00:22:02.715 --> 00:22:08.145
Um, and so I was obedient to that started
this discipleship group and it has been.

00:22:09.435 --> 00:22:11.985
Oh, man, it's been so good.

00:22:12.495 --> 00:22:14.985
Um, it's just a group of
ladies that come together.

00:22:15.285 --> 00:22:21.525
Um, we share, um, life, we
get into God's word together.

00:22:21.855 --> 00:22:23.865
Um, just.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:25.620
It's just so good.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.659
So I'm saying all that to say that is
the future of inspiring hope as well.

00:22:30.689 --> 00:22:35.459
Um, we started, I started with, um,
our, our core team ladies, but that's

00:22:35.459 --> 00:22:40.320
what we want to eventually do is to
start that, um, throughout our whole,

00:22:40.409 --> 00:22:45.750
um, congregation, um, our men have a
discipleship group going right now to,

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.649
um, and then as it is a commitment, like.

00:22:50.205 --> 00:22:52.004
Meet for a year every week.

00:22:52.065 --> 00:22:55.605
Um, if you can, and, um, so much growth.

00:22:55.605 --> 00:23:00.764
And then after the year, all of the
ladies are supposed to like break off

00:23:00.764 --> 00:23:06.044
and start new groups and, um, yes, it's
to hang out and that's so much fun,

00:23:06.044 --> 00:23:08.715
but also, um, just to grow in Christ.

00:23:08.715 --> 00:23:09.945
And so it's so good.

00:23:09.945 --> 00:23:13.845
And so, um, that is probably one
of my favorite memories from this.

00:23:15.115 --> 00:23:15.505
Awesome.

00:23:15.865 --> 00:23:16.285
Awesome.

00:23:16.615 --> 00:23:18.985
I'm just going to kind of work
my way back for people who've

00:23:18.985 --> 00:23:20.065
already committed to get share.

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.715
And then after that more can share.

00:23:21.715 --> 00:23:22.945
So I'll have you guys go ahead and share.

00:23:24.055 --> 00:23:26.245
So I told him, let me standing up.

00:23:27.355 --> 00:23:28.225
I thought we weren't standing up.

00:23:28.255 --> 00:23:28.585
Okay.

00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:29.125
We're standing up.

00:23:29.695 --> 00:23:32.485
I told him that I wasn't going to share it
cause I'm always the one that talks, but

00:23:32.515 --> 00:23:33.895
I'm just going to quickly say one thing.

00:23:35.324 --> 00:23:40.095
Um, so a lot of, you know, our
story, um, I've been battling cancer

00:23:40.095 --> 00:23:43.125
for the last year, suffered two
miscarriages right before the cancer.

00:23:43.125 --> 00:23:45.284
It's actually what led
me to finding the cancer.

00:23:45.705 --> 00:23:50.294
Um, and so when we talk about all
the amazing things that God has done

00:23:50.445 --> 00:23:54.855
this year, it's not in the presence
or with the absence of bad things.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.710
And we were telling, we were
talking to a couple of friends.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.610
Um, another woman that I met in
chemo, uh, just about the story and

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:03.510
what we were doing with the church.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.750
And she was like, how the
heck are you guys doing that?

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.690
Like church stuff while you're like this.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.560
And I said, I couldn't
have done this with.

00:24:14.324 --> 00:24:19.364
That, um, and that's such a different
way to be thinking about life, because

00:24:19.364 --> 00:24:24.854
I think so often we try to hold our
time and hold precious our gifts and our

00:24:24.854 --> 00:24:28.604
talents and every moment, and we have
to, you know, sometimes we'll let God

00:24:28.604 --> 00:24:31.544
in and we'll let God take a little piece
of it if we have enough time leftover.

00:24:31.784 --> 00:24:36.765
Um, but when you flip that
script, It's just really cool.

00:24:37.155 --> 00:24:38.925
And there's really cool things
that God does through that.

00:24:38.955 --> 00:24:41.565
And so just want to encourage
anyone who's feeling weary.

00:24:41.835 --> 00:24:42.675
Who's feeling tired.

00:24:42.675 --> 00:24:45.765
Who's feeling like I really didn't want to
have to get up early on a Sunday morning

00:24:45.765 --> 00:24:49.995
to go to church, um, or is thinking, wow,
like that sounds like there's a lot, um,

00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:55.435
Those are the things that make life worth
living and God shows up in those moments.

00:24:55.435 --> 00:24:58.495
And so I just want to praise God
for this church in this community.

00:24:58.555 --> 00:25:01.885
I'm celebrating my one year
diagnosis of cancer in four days.

00:25:01.915 --> 00:25:04.465
And so it's a, a bittersweet for us.

00:25:04.525 --> 00:25:07.405
Um, but so excited that
we get to be here today.

00:25:07.705 --> 00:25:09.055
Um, and so I'll start.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:21.550
So I think to, to kind of expand on,
on what Amanda's talking about, um,

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:26.170
just the one thing that you, you were
talking about that it just way has been

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.910
weighing on my heart the last few years.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:34.060
It's just being intentional and, um,
not just letting things happen, you

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:42.600
know, but making decisions, um, And,
you know, there's just in the early

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:47.070
days, you know, even before we, uh,
committed to, to Ben and Brittany to

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.240
come out and plant, um, that was, that
was something that was on our hearts.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.800
Um, that was something that, that
we, we were kind of yearning for it.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.580
We were kind of yearning for that
in a church, um, as well as just

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:01.830
trying to explore that in our lives.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:05.455
Um, Uh, with, with the Lord.

00:26:05.455 --> 00:26:09.475
And, um, we kinda, we kinda hit, uh, 2020.

00:26:09.475 --> 00:26:13.825
And I think we, I mean, just like
everybody, we were shell shocked and it

00:26:13.975 --> 00:26:18.415
caused us to start to reevaluate a lot of
things that were going on in our lives.

00:26:18.565 --> 00:26:23.784
Um, a lot of our values, the things
that we, uh, wanted desired did.

00:26:24.024 --> 00:26:28.195
And, um, one of the big things
that we realized was that, that

00:26:28.225 --> 00:26:30.745
the church that we were at it was.

00:26:31.575 --> 00:26:36.075
Uh, w we felt like God was
stirring something in our hearts,

00:26:36.435 --> 00:26:40.784
um, that we weren't finding
at the church that we were at.

00:26:40.845 --> 00:26:51.105
And we realized, um, and particularly
for me, I realized that, um, you know,

00:26:51.135 --> 00:26:56.774
when, when God is calling you out, Even
if it's difficult, no matter what it is,

00:26:56.774 --> 00:27:01.605
if it's moving, if it's a job, if it's
house, um, he gives you peace about it.

00:27:02.355 --> 00:27:06.975
And I think he creates unsettlement in
our hearts too, when we're not there.

00:27:07.965 --> 00:27:12.074
Um, as like the impetus, the energy
to get us moving in that direction.

00:27:12.554 --> 00:27:17.594
And we really felt that, um, and
right around that same time, we were

00:27:17.594 --> 00:27:19.514
starting to get to know the main rooms.

00:27:19.574 --> 00:27:24.870
Um, We had like a, just a, a zoom date.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:30.870
You know, we were sitting on our patio,
um, one of the first, really nice

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:37.140
days of spring 2020, and we just kinda
chatted with Ben and Brittany, you know,

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.810
kind of learn a little bit about their
hearts and what they were all about.

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.640
Um, and.

00:27:43.065 --> 00:27:46.395
It was infectious that kind of their,
their drive, their desire for the Lord.

00:27:46.485 --> 00:27:48.885
Um, and some of the things that
they were talking about were

00:27:48.885 --> 00:27:52.665
already things that God had pricked
our hearts to move forward with.

00:27:53.175 --> 00:27:58.125
Um, and so, you know, even that day,
you know, I think Amanda and I were

00:27:58.645 --> 00:27:59.865
like, well, Hey, this could be cool.

00:27:59.865 --> 00:28:04.785
This is like, you know, maybe this is
the magnet that God is pulling us out

00:28:04.785 --> 00:28:07.125
from where we were to something greater.

00:28:07.755 --> 00:28:11.295
Um, and then over the course
of that year, we got to know.

00:28:12.165 --> 00:28:13.605
You know, we, we joined the team.

00:28:14.024 --> 00:28:19.995
Um, and specifically, um, in those
early days, there were a lot of things

00:28:19.995 --> 00:28:21.524
that we had to be intentional about.

00:28:21.735 --> 00:28:23.595
We realized this is brand new.

00:28:24.195 --> 00:28:26.834
Um, this is not something
that is created for us.

00:28:26.834 --> 00:28:29.235
You know, when you, when you join
a church, you know, and it's been

00:28:29.235 --> 00:28:30.554
going for 30 years, you're joining.

00:28:31.485 --> 00:28:34.785
You know, a group that's been together
for 30 years, there's culture there,

00:28:35.085 --> 00:28:38.115
you know, there's people, you know,
there's relationships there there's,

00:28:38.325 --> 00:28:40.005
you know, stuff is set in motion.

00:28:40.455 --> 00:28:44.565
Um, you know, the way that the
service works, it's all been decided.

00:28:45.195 --> 00:28:45.825
And.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.429
Somebody had to do some of the
deciding and we realized early on

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.610
like, wait, that's us now, we've
got to start making decisions

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:54.870
and being intentional about this.

00:28:54.929 --> 00:28:58.590
Um, and one of the things that we
really wanted to be intentional

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:04.200
about was creating a culture of, of
discipleship, but you know, a culture

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:10.110
that, uh, It's about people, you
know, because God is about people.

00:29:10.139 --> 00:29:11.820
Why isn't the church about people?

00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:16.439
You know, so often I feel like, and when
we've lived this too, not necessarily

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:21.000
recently, but I think we all kind
of know culturally or, or generally,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.120
you know, the church is not really
known for its missional work anymore.

00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:27.960
Like it's not really known for like
how it embraces people anymore.

00:29:28.439 --> 00:29:32.220
Um, I think Ben Ben talks about like,
he would rather the church be known for.

00:29:33.004 --> 00:29:34.355
Um, rather than what it's against.

00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:37.595
And I think there's a lot of that
friction, uh, that we get from pop

00:29:37.595 --> 00:29:41.375
culture nowadays, where the church is
known for its friction, rather than

00:29:41.375 --> 00:29:46.625
for its fluid fluidity of loving and
accepting and bringing people to,

00:29:46.655 --> 00:29:48.545
to know the Lord in a deeper way.

00:29:48.995 --> 00:29:55.475
Um, and early on, we, we really
just, uh, realized that was

00:29:55.475 --> 00:29:56.915
something that we desired for church.

00:29:57.425 --> 00:30:01.775
Um, and you know what,
it might look different.

00:30:02.925 --> 00:30:05.625
You know, um, you know,
the Bible talks about that.

00:30:05.625 --> 00:30:08.925
The church is set apart that as
Christians we're set apart and

00:30:08.925 --> 00:30:10.935
that does look different, it
looks different in the world.

00:30:10.965 --> 00:30:13.514
And I think when churches are
really following that and pursuing

00:30:13.514 --> 00:30:18.615
after that, that looks different
to, um, you know, it's radical.

00:30:18.764 --> 00:30:24.524
It's maybe a little weird and you
know, if people slice it right down the

00:30:24.524 --> 00:30:28.845
middle, it might look stupid because
it means that you do some things.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.620
That other churches don't do that.

00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:35.340
Other groups don't do, like
make you talk to each other for

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.480
five minutes between service.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:36.690
Yeah.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.899
Yeah.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.110
So even, even that, that
was built into our service.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.600
That was something that we decided
early on that we wanted to do, because

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.159
we we'd experienced that before.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:50.669
And if, you know, as a introvert,
people were like, this is uncomfortable.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:52.889
This is maybe stupid.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:53.490
Yeah.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.074
Um, But we grew from that.

00:30:57.105 --> 00:30:58.995
We grew in our relationships
with other people.

00:30:59.084 --> 00:31:04.274
Um, we grew in our, our relationships
with the Lord by seeing how other

00:31:04.274 --> 00:31:05.745
people were living their lives.

00:31:05.745 --> 00:31:10.875
And, um, you know, when they were excited,
you know, about, about their walk with

00:31:10.875 --> 00:31:15.044
the Lord, uh, when they were grieving,
we got, got moments to like, you know,

00:31:15.074 --> 00:31:19.125
just check in and, and grieve with them
for just a moment before, before service.

00:31:19.125 --> 00:31:20.205
And, and that was huge.

00:31:20.355 --> 00:31:22.635
And that th that's something
that we were intentional about.

00:31:23.415 --> 00:31:25.770
Um, So all of this was going on.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.790
We had several meetings as
a, as a core team early on.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:33.929
And in one of those meetings, this
just all came out like a flood.

00:31:34.139 --> 00:31:37.139
We were talking about culture, what we
wanted, the decisions that we had to make.

00:31:37.649 --> 00:31:45.899
And, um, I tend to speak off, off the
cuff and, uh, tend to go a little longer.

00:31:45.899 --> 00:31:49.530
So, uh, I just said, you know what?

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.690
I really want to be a
church that looks that way.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:53.700
That is different in those ways.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.210
That is different in all the good
ways, you know, without sacrificing

00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:02.490
the core values of, of who we are
being disciples, um, and disciplers.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:02.820
Yeah.

00:32:03.345 --> 00:32:07.905
You know, leaning into the Lord, um,
pursuing after him and pursuing people,

00:32:08.325 --> 00:32:10.875
uh, because he's called us to do that.

00:32:11.325 --> 00:32:16.665
And I said, I don't want to be a church
that looks stupidly radically weird.

00:32:17.385 --> 00:32:19.605
And so this year has been the.

00:32:20.165 --> 00:32:25.325
Of inspiring hope, living
stupidly, radically weird.

00:32:25.655 --> 00:32:28.475
You guys didn't realize that
that was what was going on.

00:32:28.865 --> 00:32:32.705
Uh, but I promise we're going to be
less stupid, but we're going to be just

00:32:32.705 --> 00:32:34.595
as radically weird in the coming year.

00:32:34.895 --> 00:32:40.955
Um, but as you guys are leaving, we
have a small gift for you that, um,

00:32:41.435 --> 00:32:45.095
hopefully clarifies a little bit of this.

00:32:45.395 --> 00:32:48.935
It gives you, um, uh,
kind of just, uh, another.

00:32:49.795 --> 00:32:54.985
Way to experience, um, a little bit
of what we've experienced this year

00:32:55.045 --> 00:33:01.615
as a reminder, um, that the future is
what, you know, God has planned for us.

00:33:01.945 --> 00:33:07.405
Um, but that we're not just walking
through it without taking a part in it.

00:33:07.735 --> 00:33:13.215
Um, you know, there's still a lot
of things left to do, um, Yeah.

00:33:13.215 --> 00:33:17.774
I mean, again, like Ben frequently
says, you know, if we're not dead,

00:33:18.675 --> 00:33:20.205
God still has a plan for you.

00:33:20.385 --> 00:33:25.784
And, uh, it's just exciting that
we get to walk into this next year.

00:33:26.235 --> 00:33:32.804
Um, you know, walking into it and, you
know, leaning in yearning for the Lord,

00:33:32.925 --> 00:33:35.504
um, and yearning for what he has for us.

00:33:42.855 --> 00:33:44.235
You guys want to go ahead and go next.

00:33:44.865 --> 00:33:45.645
Whoever's going.

00:33:45.885 --> 00:33:48.495
If you want to, you can come up or
you can stay in where your head.

00:33:48.524 --> 00:33:49.155
I don't really.

00:33:49.245 --> 00:33:50.115
It's up to you guys.

00:33:51.675 --> 00:33:52.125
Okay.

00:33:52.335 --> 00:33:53.115
I'm Lauren.

00:33:53.235 --> 00:33:55.575
This is my husband, Brian, and
we've been a part of this church.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:57.330
Five months.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:01.680
So you've heard about that
terrible October rainy fall Fest.

00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:04.409
I think it was thrown for us personally.

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:05.340
And thank you for that.

00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:08.940
Um, we were there with maybe two
other families, um, but we came

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.239
to this church because of a fall
Fest and the faith of a child.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:15.360
So Ben's oldest Peyton dances
with my daughter, Carly, and she

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.850
invited her over and over again.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.350
And we showed up at that fall
Fest and it was rainy, but we left

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:24.600
knowing people, people knew us and.

00:34:25.364 --> 00:34:26.355
Peyton kept asking.

00:34:26.355 --> 00:34:28.574
And one Sunday morning,
we're like, okay, we'll go.

00:34:28.574 --> 00:34:31.364
And we've been here every
Sunday that we could.

00:34:31.995 --> 00:34:34.004
Um, so we're thankful for community.

00:34:34.274 --> 00:34:36.824
Um, we've accepted salvation.

00:34:36.824 --> 00:34:38.205
Our children have accepted salvation.

00:34:38.205 --> 00:34:39.314
We've been baptized.

00:34:39.435 --> 00:34:42.674
Um, so we're, we're grateful,
but I will say if you're looking

00:34:42.674 --> 00:34:45.464
for community, this is the place.

00:34:45.495 --> 00:34:47.834
And I was reading a devotional yesterday.

00:34:48.555 --> 00:34:50.955
Um, and it was called made
for more, but it says the

00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:52.425
community centered around Jesus.

00:34:52.875 --> 00:34:57.195
The church is intended to be authentic
and with authenticity comes honesty,

00:34:57.225 --> 00:34:58.725
the easy kind and the hard kind.

00:34:58.935 --> 00:35:00.405
Um, and that's what we've found here.

00:35:02.775 --> 00:35:05.085
So I originally wasn't going to
share anything, but then after

00:35:05.085 --> 00:35:08.235
hearing a couple other people, I
decided I was going to, and you have.

00:35:08.655 --> 00:35:12.915
I think it was Jason and Christina,
she said at first, you know, she was

00:35:12.915 --> 00:35:17.505
okay with Justin, the lukewarmness
and I was okay with just being okay.

00:35:17.505 --> 00:35:18.615
It was my time.

00:35:18.615 --> 00:35:19.425
It was my way.

00:35:19.425 --> 00:35:20.655
I like being in control.

00:35:20.655 --> 00:35:22.995
I like knowing what's going to
happen and making the decisions.

00:35:24.105 --> 00:35:26.835
And then there was one day,
you know, I woke up and it was.

00:35:28.965 --> 00:35:29.985
I felt different.

00:35:30.315 --> 00:35:31.995
I felt inspired.

00:35:32.175 --> 00:35:33.195
I felt hopeful.

00:35:33.195 --> 00:35:38.805
And I just kind of pushed me aside
and said, okay, Lord lead me.

00:35:39.135 --> 00:35:39.285
And.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.260
That's when everything changed and I
accepted salvation and I wasn't okay

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:48.000
with just being okay and living for
myself or trying to direct the kids,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.010
those that, and trying to lead the kids
and to be a better husband and father.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.400
And everyone has mentioned community.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.990
We did the church hopping.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.830
We had settled on another church
a couple of weeks before COVID

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.090
had hit and shut everything down.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.710
And then we didn't go for a long time.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.560
And then that rainy October day, we found.

00:36:08.835 --> 00:36:12.225
Our people, we found the
sense of community that we had

00:36:12.225 --> 00:36:13.484
been looking for everywhere.

00:36:14.145 --> 00:36:17.234
If you go somewhere else, if you
don't go anywhere else, if you haven't

00:36:17.234 --> 00:36:19.484
been in a long time, come back.

00:36:20.174 --> 00:36:22.095
This is the place where the community is.

00:36:22.095 --> 00:36:26.355
Everyone here has meant something
to us in every way possible.

00:36:33.375 --> 00:36:34.395
Noah, you said you want to share.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:35.850
Yeah.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:43.250
So my name's Noah, um, I've been
here, I guess it was, I feel it was

00:36:43.259 --> 00:36:45.090
one week before the Easter service.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:51.029
So about a year now, I guess, a little
over a year, but, uh, I just wanted

00:36:51.029 --> 00:36:55.799
to share about how I go to Orville
and Laura's, uh, Tuesday night group.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:02.280
And the community, there has been
something I have enjoyed so much

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.080
more than I thought I ever would.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.770
It has helped me more
than I thought it would.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:12.570
More than just any other Wednesday
night group I thought I'd ever go to.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.620
And it's just been,
they've been so caring.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:22.230
It has, uh, they've helped me when
I was very, I was far down just.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.460
From different circumstances that
happened in my life, just they

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:31.410
have, they helped me, I don't know,
get back, started following God

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:35.400
again, and just really brought me
back up spiritually and mentally.

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:41.430
And so it was just that, and this church
has the, as everyone keeps saying the

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:46.770
community here, it's just something that
is so good that I have loved thoroughly.

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:49.650
And it has helped me a lot
more than I ever thought.

00:37:51.015 --> 00:37:51.375
Awesome.

00:37:56.205 --> 00:37:56.595
Elisa.

00:37:56.595 --> 00:37:57.165
You're coming.

00:37:58.065 --> 00:37:58.365
Okay.

00:37:58.635 --> 00:37:59.175
You and Doug?

00:37:59.415 --> 00:37:59.865
Awesome.

00:38:05.745 --> 00:38:06.885
My name is Alisa.

00:38:07.425 --> 00:38:08.715
I don't like microphones.

00:38:09.255 --> 00:38:10.425
Um, this is Doug.

00:38:10.635 --> 00:38:11.385
My husband.

00:38:11.445 --> 00:38:13.095
We've been coming to inspiring hope since.

00:38:13.964 --> 00:38:18.375
I don't, I think it's November
20, 20, I think maybe October.

00:38:18.404 --> 00:38:18.975
I can't remember.

00:38:19.634 --> 00:38:24.375
Um, but it's been amazing and the
community is great, but I wrote down

00:38:24.375 --> 00:38:26.595
what I was going to say, because
I usually black out when I get a

00:38:26.595 --> 00:38:28.665
microphone, because I'm so nervous.

00:38:29.895 --> 00:38:31.665
So I'm going to say the words on my phone.

00:38:31.964 --> 00:38:32.444
All right.

00:38:33.254 --> 00:38:33.585
Okay.

00:38:33.615 --> 00:38:33.825
So.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:38.730
Preface, um, inspiring hope is
wonderful community and that's

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:42.840
great, but they personally, when I
thought, what do I want to talk about?

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.140
What is different about my life
this year versus the year before?

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.170
Um, they have challenged me.

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:52.290
So like that word that I was
challenged is what came to mind.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:55.530
And so I have been so
challenged by inspiring hope.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.440
We have been challenged, my
kids have been challenged.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:00.660
Um, and so these are some
scriptures that came to mind.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.290
The word of God is a lamp to my feet.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:09.490
To my path, Psalm one 19 inspiring hope
church has challenged me to actually

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:13.990
prioritize, spending time in the word
and letting his word be my guide.

00:39:15.825 --> 00:39:21.315
Be a doer of the word, not hearers
only James 1 22 inspiring hope

00:39:21.345 --> 00:39:25.605
church has challenged me to allow
God's word to change me in really.

00:39:25.635 --> 00:39:31.815
And then to physically do something
with that to set the Lord always before

00:39:31.815 --> 00:39:33.645
me, because he is at my right hand.

00:39:33.645 --> 00:39:34.845
I shall not be shaken.

00:39:35.265 --> 00:39:36.315
So I'm 16, eight.

00:39:36.585 --> 00:39:40.815
I'm still working on this one, but I have
been more aware of my need to seek Jesus.

00:39:41.865 --> 00:39:46.424
And in the middle and after, and
always to spend time in prayer and

00:39:46.424 --> 00:39:47.924
to attempt to always set him before.

00:39:49.245 --> 00:39:53.415
Whoever abides in Christ and lets Christ
abide in him will bear much fruit because

00:39:53.415 --> 00:39:55.215
apart from Christ, we can do nothing.

00:39:55.815 --> 00:40:00.495
John 15 five, it's good to read the
word of God and to let you guide and

00:40:00.495 --> 00:40:03.705
to let it guide you and to change you,
it's good to have the head knowledge

00:40:03.705 --> 00:40:05.115
of who Christ is and what he's done.

00:40:05.595 --> 00:40:09.555
It's good to be a doer of the word,
all that is truly great, but because

00:40:09.555 --> 00:40:13.275
of inspiring hope, challenging me
to do all those things challenging

00:40:13.275 --> 00:40:14.925
my family, my husband, my children.

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:16.350
To do all those things.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:20.790
I feel like I've experienced more
of this abiding relationship with

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:23.040
Jesus and that's been very good.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:26.700
He doesn't like to talk.

00:40:35.855 --> 00:40:38.435
Normally it would be Orval and
Laura, Laura is out sick today.

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:39.275
So we prayed for her.

00:40:39.275 --> 00:40:39.545
Laura.

00:40:39.545 --> 00:40:41.135
You're probably watching online.

00:40:41.525 --> 00:40:44.435
I know you would share, but
we're going to let Orville fill

00:40:44.435 --> 00:40:45.905
the gap for both of y'all today.

00:40:46.265 --> 00:40:47.345
So don't let her down.

00:40:52.295 --> 00:40:52.775
It's Sunday.

00:40:52.775 --> 00:40:54.185
She's got to forgive me if I let her do.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.360
So, yeah, I'm horrible.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:40:59.340
Um, this is my wife, Laura.

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.970
Usually she does all the talking,
but today it's going to be me.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.590
Um, she actually did give me something
to say in text form so that I don't

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.680
screw it up because otherwise I
would, I just forget a whole bunch.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:14.910
I don't remember a whole lot, not
because I'm old, just that's how I am.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.740
Uh, and, uh, last.

00:41:19.634 --> 00:41:22.904
Talking about not remembering, I don't
remember a whole lot about last year,

00:41:23.025 --> 00:41:30.075
but the things I do remember are,
um, we've been doing our group that

00:41:30.075 --> 00:41:31.935
Noah's come to, I didn't want to do it.

00:41:32.475 --> 00:41:36.464
Um, and Laura was like, this would be fun.

00:41:36.464 --> 00:41:38.205
And I'm like, Hmm, not really.

00:41:38.595 --> 00:41:43.275
Um, but one of the reasons we got the
house that we got was because we wanted

00:41:43.275 --> 00:41:47.565
to host people and I say, we mostly her,
but I thought, yes, this is a good idea.

00:41:48.825 --> 00:41:52.995
And not just like have parties,
like actually have conversations

00:41:52.995 --> 00:41:55.004
about Christ with people, neighbors.

00:41:55.274 --> 00:41:57.585
So when the opportunity came along
and she was like, let's do this.

00:41:57.615 --> 00:42:00.075
I was like, well, that
was kind of the idea.

00:42:00.105 --> 00:42:00.794
I can't say no.

00:42:00.794 --> 00:42:01.125
Right.

00:42:01.214 --> 00:42:03.225
That would kind of be hypocritical.

00:42:03.435 --> 00:42:07.605
So I did it and every Wednesday
comes around and I'm working

00:42:07.665 --> 00:42:08.865
and it's like three o'clock.

00:42:09.165 --> 00:42:13.605
I haven't been preparing anything the
rest of the week, Ben sends over some

00:42:13.605 --> 00:42:17.714
questions and I'm like, all right, I'm
not going to get to look these over.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:20.850
Um, and I just wing it every single week.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:25.710
And to hear Noah say, like, this has
actually changed, my life is amazing for

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.930
me because I didn't do any of that work.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:29.760
That was all other people.

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:32.370
Laura got the house clean with the kids.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.870
Ben sent a request.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:36.150
I showed up and I looked pretty.

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:40.350
Um, and any work that gets
done there, that's all Christ.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:44.580
So that's amazing for me to
that's my takeaway from that.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:45.600
Um, but also.

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:53.430
The bare minimum that you give
Christ, he can do wonders with it.

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:56.730
Um, and now this year I'm
thinking, what do I do this year?

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.920
What if I did put some
actual effort into it?

00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.190
Right.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:02.580
Maybe he'd do even more
amazing things with that.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:09.090
Um, so I had to say my thing
first, because her is, is far more

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:11.850
spiritual and probably impactful.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:12.420
So this is.

00:43:13.425 --> 00:43:16.154
Laura is one of the, say it to you.

00:43:16.185 --> 00:43:18.225
So when I say I, it's not me, it's her.

00:43:18.345 --> 00:43:21.615
Um, so this past year
I've seen life change.

00:43:22.035 --> 00:43:23.625
I've seen people grow in their faith.

00:43:23.685 --> 00:43:26.565
I've seen people rally around
each other in their struggles.

00:43:26.805 --> 00:43:31.665
I've seen mountains move since saying
yes to inspiring hope church in

00:43:31.665 --> 00:43:36.285
July of 2020, God has continuously
grown my faith, my understanding

00:43:36.285 --> 00:43:37.995
of his word and my confidence.

00:43:39.255 --> 00:43:43.485
Uh, without Jesus moving in my life
over these last few years, I would have

00:43:43.485 --> 00:43:45.735
missed many opportunities to put my yes.

00:43:45.735 --> 00:43:46.395
On the table.

00:43:47.835 --> 00:43:50.475
The opportunity to plant a
church, the further his kingdom.

00:43:50.745 --> 00:43:51.345
Yes.

00:43:51.705 --> 00:43:54.915
The opportunity to help plan
details of the children's ministry.

00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:55.634
Yes.

00:43:55.995 --> 00:43:58.125
The opportunity to start a small group.

00:43:58.215 --> 00:43:58.665
Yes.

00:43:59.505 --> 00:44:01.065
The opportunity to lead worship.

00:44:01.125 --> 00:44:02.384
Whoa, sweaty palms.

00:44:02.384 --> 00:44:06.615
But yes, the opportunity to grow
in Christ through the discipleship.

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:07.860
Yes.

00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:10.830
The opportunity to direct a VBS.

00:44:11.009 --> 00:44:11.549
Yes.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.069
The opportunity to surrender to ministry.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:14.670
Yes.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:19.710
God has continued to teach me
to release control over my life

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.960
and the ideas I had for it.

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:27.390
Ooh, there's more, let me
click the read more button.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.430
It's streaming.

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:33.730
Uh, God has continued to teach
me to release control over my

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:36.970
life and the ideas I had for it
and to trust and abide in him.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.549
My love for Jesus has grown deeper.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.290
My marriage has grown stronger.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:46.540
My kids, well, they're still kids, but
they've gotten to see their mom grow and

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:50.350
what a Testament for them to be able to
have front row seats to what Jesus can do.

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:50.589
And so.

00:44:51.825 --> 00:44:52.545
This coming year.

00:44:52.545 --> 00:44:54.855
I cannot wait to see where God takes us.

00:44:54.885 --> 00:44:58.605
I know that if we continue to put
our yes on the table, he will give

00:44:58.605 --> 00:45:02.085
us more opportunities to serve more
opportunities, to glorify him and more

00:45:02.085 --> 00:45:03.555
opportunities to grow his kingdom.

00:45:04.095 --> 00:45:08.805
I'm excited for VBS kids, camps,
mission teams, new locations.

00:45:09.555 --> 00:45:14.355
I know that God is going to continue
moving mountains so that we can continue

00:45:14.355 --> 00:45:15.705
to do the job he has called us to do.

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:17.850
We get to live inspired.

00:45:17.879 --> 00:45:21.210
We get to share the hope of Jesus
with others, and I'm thankful

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:23.160
I get to do it with all of you.

00:45:23.759 --> 00:45:25.890
Happy one year anniversary, inspire hope.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:26.790
Yeah,

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:34.620
thanks Laura, for sharing
that through Orville.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.350
So this is the part where I
know many of you are like, Hey,

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:38.430
I'm ready to run out of here.

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:40.440
If you did not tell me you want to share.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.620
If you're a guest today and you want to
share, this is an opportunity to stand

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.060
up where you are and you can share.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:46.380
So if you want to, you
can raise your hand.

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.930
If you don't want to share, I'm not
forcing anybody, but it's an opportunity.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:49.260
So.

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:51.780
Last chance anybody else want to share?

00:45:52.259 --> 00:45:52.800
You want to share?

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.310
Okay, good.

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.900
You just stand over there and share.

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:55.320
Go for it.

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:55.890
This is great.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.259
Well, first I have new say
hi to my friend, Lauren.

00:45:59.445 --> 00:46:04.665
Because she's home and I miss her today,
but I wanted to thank you, uh, for, uh,

00:46:04.665 --> 00:46:09.555
you know, when Noah said he wanted to come
to this church, I initially as Todd and

00:46:09.555 --> 00:46:13.725
I, we were initially like, oh, he goes,
you know, he's goes for his mom and dad,

00:46:13.725 --> 00:46:19.155
you know, but it was such a blessing that
he wanted to do his church on his own.

00:46:19.695 --> 00:46:21.015
And you've been such a blessing.

00:46:21.225 --> 00:46:23.205
Uh, Matt was such a blessing at camp.

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.620
That was Noah reminded me.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:30.720
Cause just last week I said, ah, I
don't think I want to go to youth camp.

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.810
Cause it's, it's a thing that's
coming up and thinking about going.

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.540
And I'm like, I just don't think
I really want to go and do that.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.900
He's like, you know, mom, Matt
didn't want to go and look what a

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.340
blessing he wanted to be into me.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:41.430
And.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:46.350
I know, uh, you know, like I'll pray
about it, I guess, you know, it was like,

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:50.310
jeez, but I just thought that was anyways.

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:52.770
I just thank you all
for pouring in to Noah.

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:58.980
And as has his parents, we are so thankful
and Orville you and Laura are a blessing

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.660
and we do thank you both for that.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.170
And so.

00:47:02.265 --> 00:47:03.975
R and he loves you kids.

00:47:04.005 --> 00:47:05.025
He talks about you guys.

00:47:05.025 --> 00:47:07.455
He talks about all of you
and he comes home and shares

00:47:07.455 --> 00:47:09.195
everything, the testimonies.

00:47:09.195 --> 00:47:11.295
And so I just thank you all for that.

00:47:11.385 --> 00:47:11.745
Cool.

00:47:12.045 --> 00:47:12.465
Awesome.

00:47:16.485 --> 00:47:16.725
All right.

00:47:16.725 --> 00:47:18.255
Does anybody else want to share again?

00:47:18.645 --> 00:47:22.215
That's your opportunity once.

00:47:24.205 --> 00:47:25.075
Going twice.

00:47:26.215 --> 00:47:26.605
Okay.

00:47:27.565 --> 00:47:27.835
All right.

00:47:27.835 --> 00:47:30.925
So here's how we're going to sh uh,
in today, um, we're going to end

00:47:30.925 --> 00:47:36.384
today just praying for our community
and for the future of inspiring hope.

00:47:36.745 --> 00:47:39.865
And so, um, after we do that,
we're going to end it with

00:47:39.865 --> 00:47:42.355
worship and then, um, dismiss.

00:47:42.685 --> 00:47:44.634
Um, but here here's my challenge to you.

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:48.205
It's your first time to, if this is
your thousand time at this point,

00:47:48.205 --> 00:47:49.225
you've been with us that long.

00:47:49.555 --> 00:47:52.225
Um, I believe this, and this
is why we started this church.

00:47:52.225 --> 00:47:53.785
We believe guys called
us to start this church.

00:47:54.505 --> 00:47:57.445
God wants to do something in
and through each one of you.

00:47:58.635 --> 00:48:01.105
I've said this so many times, and
I hope if you've heard it a million

00:48:01.105 --> 00:48:03.685
times, you're you're now tired of
it, but that means you've got it.

00:48:04.315 --> 00:48:08.815
There is someone waiting on you
on the other side of your yes.

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:11.790
This year coming up.

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.470
I don't care if you're a part
of inspiring hope or not.

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:15.270
You're a part of a school
you're part of something else.

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:21.060
God is ready to use you to impact
the lives of someone else that

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:25.620
challenges me to leave out of here
saying, yes, God, I believe you.

00:48:26.009 --> 00:48:26.880
I trust you.

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.550
And you begin to discover that, right.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.070
We're here to help you discover
God's purpose in your life,

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.120
through relationship with Jesus.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.490
We'd love to talk to you more
about that after service.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:36.570
If you have questions.

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:41.160
Thank you so much for being part of
this, but I'm going to leave some prayer.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:44.850
You guys can pray alongside me and
praying for again, our community,

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:48.870
the future of inspiring hope, the
things that we have ahead of us.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.290
Um, God hears prayers.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:56.340
You guys aren't answer to the
prayers that we prayed so long ago.

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:59.640
So that's why we're going to pray today
for those who will show up in the future.

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.140
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:06.420
We know that you are so
important in our lives.

00:49:07.154 --> 00:49:08.445
You are the reason why we're here.

00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:10.875
You're the reason why we
have planted this church.

00:49:10.904 --> 00:49:13.725
And there, you're the reason why
we're going into the next year

00:49:14.205 --> 00:49:18.165
Lord with probably more questions
than we have answers, but we

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:19.515
know that you will be faithful.

00:49:20.115 --> 00:49:21.315
So Lord, we're praying for that.

00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:25.005
We're praying for the next location Lord,
where we'll meet in the next three months.

00:49:25.335 --> 00:49:26.925
Um, after this next three
months, Lord, I don't know.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.710
Uh, Lord, I don't know what person
will walk back into the store that

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:36.030
came today or what person to walk in
the door next week or a month from now

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:37.380
or a year from now, but what you do.

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:42.750
And because of that, Lord, I pray
that we, each one of us comes

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:46.560
prepared each week to minister
that person to love on that person.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:49.680
Lord, I don't know who you're gonna
bring into our lives in our job.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.820
Or in our community when we're
out around our neighbors, Lord,

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:56.310
I don't know who you're going to
bring in our lives, but you do Lord.

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:59.970
And because of that Lord today, we can
pray knowing that you can prepare our

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:04.260
hearts, our minds, our lives Lord, to
receive that person to love on them, where

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:08.400
they are in the midst of their brokenness
Lord in the midst of their lives.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.190
Lord, I pray that we are
preparing our hearts now to say

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:13.890
yes or the challenges ahead.

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:16.650
We know there will be challenges,
Lord, but here's the cool part.

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:18.150
You've never promised.

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:20.850
To remove those challenges,
but you promised your

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:21.870
presence in the midst of them.

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.710
Lord, that's the hope that we
have Lord, those who don't have a

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:28.319
relationship with you, Lord, the
hope that they have is in themselves.

00:50:28.589 --> 00:50:30.810
And at times, Lord, that's
going to continue to fail them.

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:34.290
And that's not a knock on them Lord,
but that's just more of a reminder Lord

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:37.799
that each one of us needs to the Lord
in the days ahead, when each one of us

00:50:37.799 --> 00:50:41.970
hits Lord of tough part in our life,
Lord, and really those of us that are

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:45.089
currently in that Lord, you are present.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:45.930
You're present.

00:50:46.995 --> 00:50:50.085
Well, help us provide peace
in the midst of chaos.

00:50:50.265 --> 00:50:57.075
Hope in the midst of uncertainty love
in the midst of filling unlovable

00:50:57.585 --> 00:51:01.245
forgiveness in the midst of filling
unforgivable God, your presence

00:51:01.245 --> 00:51:02.745
means so much to us in the future.

00:51:02.775 --> 00:51:06.045
So we are praying the Lord in
the days ahead that we go, that

00:51:06.045 --> 00:51:07.245
your presence goes with us.

00:51:07.485 --> 00:51:09.405
And if it doesn't Lord,
don't send us up from here.

00:51:10.095 --> 00:51:10.485
Don't do it.

00:51:10.485 --> 00:51:10.725
Lord.

00:51:11.145 --> 00:51:12.075
We know we'll fell.

00:51:13.485 --> 00:51:14.835
God, we're so dependent upon you.

00:51:15.885 --> 00:51:19.455
So Lord, we're praying for wisdom
and direction in the days ahead for

00:51:19.455 --> 00:51:22.695
our leadership Lord, we're praying
for each person in this room.

00:51:23.115 --> 00:51:25.905
Lord, if they don't know you, that
they come to faith in you, Lord, that

00:51:25.905 --> 00:51:26.985
they begin that relationship with you.

00:51:26.985 --> 00:51:27.225
Lord.

00:51:27.225 --> 00:51:29.415
If they already know you,
Lord, I pray that they lean in.

00:51:29.415 --> 00:51:31.125
They take a next step in their faith.

00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:34.995
God, you have so much more free each
person in this room, including me.

00:51:35.325 --> 00:51:40.035
And I pray that we seek that every day
and then days ahead, or we trust you

00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:44.475
because of your faithfulness in the
past, we trust you for your faithfulness.

00:51:45.795 --> 00:51:50.715
And we trust you the faithfulness
and the days ahead, God, your good.

00:51:51.915 --> 00:51:52.985
So Lord, we pray this in your hand.

00:51:52.985 --> 00:51:53.235
My name.

00:51:53.895 --> 00:51:54.435
Amen.

00:51:54.795 --> 00:51:55.365
Amen.

00:51:55.665 --> 00:51:56.625
Let's stand and worship.
