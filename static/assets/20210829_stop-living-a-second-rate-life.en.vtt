00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.840
i'm super excited about the text that we're in 
today and so i want to start off asking this  

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.240
question because i think that this will 
really speak um to where we're heading  

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.360
i hear myself in the background there 
orville so it must be live streams working um

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.720
is do you want to become a better version 
of yourself do you want to be better than  

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.760
who you are today question anybody anybody 
want to be better than who you are today  

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440
okay so at least most of us some of us just don't 
care we just want to go down a step i had a guy  

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.840
tell me last night we went to a gathering of some 
church planters all the families got together  

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.160
and uh he says man i'm just trying to live up 
to your standards i said man you got to drop  

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.560
down a couple of rings to get to me and rose to 
get to me and he said no no so it's just that  

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.760
reminder that i think at times um maybe we 
want to be better but it's words rather than  

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.760
actions we're not really doing anything to better 
ourselves and so let me ask this question what is  

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.600
one thing you want to be better at or better 
in or better as a person what's one thing  

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:16.080
somebody yell it out communicating okay what's 
one more thing what'd you say patience okay  

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.920
communicating in patience so now we know two 
people who want to get better at communicating  

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.840
and patience somebody tell me how you can 
get better at communicating and patience

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.600
what's some things you begin to apply to your life

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.600
stay patient while communicating put them 
together we've got it all together you guys  

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.120
need to work together on this where do you think 
we find our help in communicating better or in  

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.480
being patient it's logical logical statement

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.280
anybody

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.120
through prayer okay that's 
a good start right okay yes  

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.280
no that's good too yes put 
yourself in situations right yeah  

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.360
so the reason why i'm asking that question is 
every single time that we spend time with the lord  

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.760
we can become a better person we can become a 
better version of what god has designed each  

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.400
one of us to be a better version of what god has 
designed each one of us to be if we spend time  

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.880
with him right through his word through prayer 
through corporate worship through fellowship  

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.960
we can become a better person and so those are 
a couple of areas where you guys want to become  

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.120
better and so if that's something that you're 
really intentional about you can really go to  

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.720
the lord and he can help you become that better 
version of what you know he has a plan for you  

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.600
right and so whenever i think about this i don't 
know if you guys ever look around and you see  

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.800
somebody who does have patience or somebody that 
does communicate way better than you and you begin  

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.720
to envy them and you begin to wonder like god why 
can they communicate or why do they have patience  

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.240
and i don't i don't i i tend to struggle with that 
at times where i begin to look and go man somebody  

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.040
has this and i don't have this and my pastor 
reminded me this a long time ago he says you  

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.440
know you can only be a second-rate someone 
else but you can always be a first-rate you  

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.800
and when i think about that is 
you can only be a second-rate  

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.280
someone else but you can be a first-rate 
you that god's designed you to be  

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.920
see today as we look into the story of jonah 
we're gonna be in jonah chapter one we're gonna  

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.120
walk through three more verses and some of you 
may say are we ever gonna get through the book  

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.960
of jonah at that rate i don't know we might but 
we're going to cover three more verses uh four  

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.240
five and six but we're going to start at verse one 
and here's where i'm getting at with this idea is

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:54.160
jonah chose a second-rate life and i think many 
times we find ourselves living second-rate lives  

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:03.440
lives that god didn't plan for you but you chose 
but god's saying i have a specific plan for you  

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.120
and we are running from it just like jonah was 
running so let me kind of catch you up a little  

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.160
bit about what we talked about i said last week 
but it was actually two weeks ago since we did um  

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.160
our serve sunday last week as we started walking 
through the book of jonah and we learned a couple  

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.240
of things one is jonah was a prophet which i know 
there's a song with that i'm not going to sing it  

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.880
this week but jonah is a prophet which means 
this god would speak to him he would speak to  

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.240
people and people would either listen or reject 
it and that was up to them right but there came  

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.920
this one time when god told jonah what to speak 
and jonah chose not to because he didn't like it  

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.800
and so i don't know if you guys have ever not done 
something that somebody told you to do because you  

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.480
didn't like it but i know i have and my kids have 
told me that too which makes me pretty frustrated  

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.720
um but when we look at this this this book of 
jonah we know that there's key things we hear  

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.160
about we hear about the the big fish we hear about 
jonah running we hear about nineveh but the really  

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.240
the story of jonah is really about god um and 
here's really specifically it's about god's will  

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.080
which when you want to know what god's 
will is it's really god's plan for you  

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.800
so it's god's will and how we respond to it 
and it's also about the love of god and how  

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.720
we share it with others and so i want to jump in 
and read these verses and i'm going to catch you  

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.040
up a little bit about how we started a couple 
of weeks ago in these first couple of verses  

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.960
and then we're gonna jump into the other 
verses so if you found jonah chapter one  

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.760
and just so you know if you don't have a copy 
of god's word you said hey i don't have a bible  

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.680
there's two ways that you can get one one is when 
you leave today or if you want to get up right  

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.920
now back there on our next steps table there's 
a bible it's white grab it it's yours it's free  

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.720
if you don't have a bible and you don't 
want to go grab one just pull out your phone  

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.840
go to an app store and look up the youversion 
bible app that's my favorite bible app to use you  

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.920
can download it you can find the book of jonah 
really easily and then you can jump in with us  

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.360
but i just encourage you if you don't have a 
copy of it to get one before you leave today  

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.120
it'll be valuable for you so john chapter 1 verse 
1 says this the word of the lord came to jonah  

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.600
son of amitai get up and go to the great city 
of nineveh and preach against it because their  

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.360
evil has come up before me and jonah got up to 
flee to tarshish from the lord's presence and  

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.760
he went down to joppa and found the ship going to 
tarshish he paid the fare and went down into it to  

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:30.560
go with them to tarshish from the lord's presence 
but the lord threw a great wind onto the sea and  

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:37.360
such a great storm arose on the sea that the ship 
threatened to break apart the sellers were afraid  

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.840
and each one cried out to his god and they threw 
the ship's cargo into the sea to lighten the load  

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.480
meanwhile jonah had gotten or gone down into the 
lowest part of the vessel and had stretched out  

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.920
and fallen into a deep sleep and the captain 
approached him and said what are you doing  

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:02.320
sound asleep get up call to your god and maybe 
this god will consider us and we won't perish  

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.120
so last week or two weeks ago i keep saying last 
week two weeks ago when we jumped into this book  

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.480
one of the things that i i quickly wrote down and 
really how i titled that message was don't be too  

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.560
quick to judge i think it's easy to look at this 
story and say hey the word of the lord came to  

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:23.760
jonah and he ran what an idiot i wouldn't have 
done that i mean the word of the lord spoke to  

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:30.000
jonah if he spoke to me like that it'd be stupid 
to run but the quicker that we got into the story  

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.800
the more we realized that we saw ourselves in 
the story see jonah had a wrong attitude towards  

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.200
several things one was the will of god and the 
second thing that we we talked about was the  

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.160
word of god and so those two combined is really 
this idea is jonah didn't like the will of god  

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.520
jonah didn't like the word of god he didn't like 
what it said and so he chose to take it or leave  

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:58.240
it i don't know about you guys but there's times 
when i'm studying god's word and i'm wondering  

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.920
do i have to take this do is this true are we 
sure that this is what god's telling us to do  

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.640
i'm going to run i'm going to turn the other way 
i'm going to act like it doesn't matter i'm going  

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.720
to pick and choose so the other things that we 
learned is we learned that jonah had a wrong  

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.200
attitude towards his circumstances because see 
when he began to disobey his circumstances at the  

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:23.040
first seemed like things were okay he was sleeping 
i mean of all things uh i mean that's that sounds  

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.920
like it was easy for him to disobey god and the 
last one was he had the wrong attitude towards  

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:35.520
the lost people who didn't know god he really 
didn't see his need to go tell people about jesus  

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.840
at the end of this message a couple weeks 
ago i don't know about you guys but for me  

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.640
i was convicted because i began to realize i 
had the wrong attitude towards the will of god  

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:51.440
the word of god my situation and the loss of god 
it wasn't just jonah so whenever early on i was  

00:08:51.440 --> 00:09:00.160
judging i was quickly changing to man that's me 
at times i could easily be jonah in this story  

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:06.720
and so today we're going to really just even build 
off of that and see how jonah's attitudes lead him  

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:13.040
to living a second-rate life and sometimes our 
attitudes lead us to live a second-rate life  

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.040
and so again when we live a second-rated 
life again that's the life that god doesn't  

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.760
have planned for you god won't leave us that way 
that's really we're going to start off today god  

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:28.400
won't leave us that way we talked about this verse 
numbers 32 23 says this but if you don't do this  

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.440
you will certainly sin against the lord 
be sure that your sin will catch up to you  

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.840
and this is what the lord is saying 
is that if you are a child of god  

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:45.280
he will not let you sin successfully without 
drawing you back and so i want to read this if  

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.440
you want to go there you can but i want to kind 
of catch you up on this idea because i want to  

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.920
affirm that truth and this is in hebrews chapter 
12. and so if you want to go to hebrews chapter  

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.000
12 you can if you just want to stay where 
you at you can as well so hebrews chapter 12  

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:06.960
verses 5 i'm going to read 5-12 and this is 
where the lord talks about not leaving us  

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.320
living a second-rate life so he says this in verse 
5 he says and you have forgotten the exhortation  

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:21.600
that addresses you as sons my son do not take the 
lord's discipline lightly or lose heart when you  

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.680
are reproved by him for the lord disciplines the 
one he loves and punishes every son he receives  

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.240
enduring or to me it says 
endure suffering as discipline  

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.360
god is dealing with you as sons for what son 
is there that a father does not discipline  

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.920
but if you are without discipline which all 
receive then you are illegitimate children  

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.200
and not sons furthermore we had human 
fathers discipline us and we respect them  

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.200
shouldn't we submit even more to 
the father of the spirits and live  

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.480
for they disciplined us for a short time based 
on what seemed good to them but he does it for  

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:03.360
our benefit so that we can share his holiness no 
discipline seems enjoyable for a time but painful  

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:09.280
but later on however it yields a peaceful fruit of 
righteousness to those who have been trained by it  

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:18.080
so those verses really just affirm this idea of a 
child of god anybody that would say i follow jesus  

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.320
when we are living second-rate lives outside 
of the will of god god will not leave us there  

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.600
god will bring about discipline and again 
as a kid i hated discipline but as a parent  

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.680
i see the value in it in disciplining my 
kids because i understand the correction  

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:40.240
for my kids brings about fruit in their lives 
a valuable life a better life lived for god  

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.680
and so when we think about this that that there 
is someone waiting for you to live your first-rate  

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.280
life there's someone waiting on you to live 
your first-rate life and number one it's really  

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:58.080
god's plan for your life the world is waiting on 
the church to live their first-rate life to live  

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:04.480
a life that is a light to the world live a life 
that is drawing people to him that hears about  

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:11.520
hope it hears about peace that hears about grace 
and truth and love and god is asking us to stop  

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.200
living that second-rate life and so what does 
it look like how do we see this with jonah's  

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.480
life what does it look like what does god do to 
interrupt our disobedience right to interrupt  

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:28.000
our disobedience or second-rate living well for 
jonah he began to destroy jonah's idols so god  

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.080
destroys our idols and so let me ask this question 
what is an idol does anybody know what an idol is

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.680
something that you place before god so in the 
old old times again you study old testament times  

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.600
you'll see them talk about images like literally 
create these images where they would worship them  

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:50.640
well we say hey we don't have those idols anymore 
right but they may be what's in your pocket or  

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.480
they may be what's on the tv or they may be 
your child's activity and so on and so forth  

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.960
is see for jonah he put his trust in a couple 
of different things right he put his trust in  

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.760
his ability to run so he had the power and the 
ability to outrun god which is kind of funny but  

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:13.280
at times i wonder if i say the same things he put 
his trust in the ship he put his trust in the crew  

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.600
and the distance that god would that he could 
create between him and god and anything that could  

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.880
distract him from his calling and so god made sure 
that the very thing that jonah put his trust in  

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.000
fell apart and this is what it says at verse 4 but 
the lord threw a great wind into the sea and such  

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.680
a greatest storm arose that the ship threatened 
to break apart he was breaking apart and creating  

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:39.840
a storm in the life of jonah to stop him from 
living the second-rate life the life that god  

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:45.440
did not have planned for him and god does the same 
thing for us and so let me let me ask this i kind  

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:51.120
of started saying some of those but what are what 
can maybe you don't have to admit your idols today  

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.680
but what can become an idol in our lives why don't 
we name some what can become idols in your life  

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:06.480
work it's a good one what else social media 
let's keep going other people ooh food

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.080
family sports man we could probably keep going 
on and on and on so there's all these things  

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:20.640
that become idols and so we we understand this 
jonah being on a ship in general is not a sin  

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.880
the crew being on the ship it's not a sin and 
sailing on a ship is not a sin but it was the  

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.600
direction he was heading and what that ship 
was causing him to do which was run from god  

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:38.800
so is sports a sin absolutely not but if we're 
choosing to be consumed by sports rather than god  

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.880
and the will of god it becomes an idol in our 
life which is sin second-rate living same thing  

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.200
happened for jonah right same thing happened for 
jonah so for you there could be a thing a person  

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.280
or a place that you have confidence in rather 
than god one of the things i throw on there is  

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.640
money um sometimes it could be our home again it 
could be our friendship it could also be substance  

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.200
the things that that we add into our lives 
thinking that that's what's going to keep us sane  

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:10.000
and so here's the thing that i know when it 
comes to this idea of knowing man when do i  

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.400
know that i'm living a second life because 
sometimes it's difficult anybody ever drove  

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.960
one of the newer cars i don't usually drive new 
cars but i happened to be in oklahoma when we went  

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.600
back a couple weeks ago and my sister let us drive 
her car around and she told me she says now i want  

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.200
to let you know this when you get in the car it's 
going to be different there's going to be these  

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.200
sensors that come on anytime you go over the line 
it's going to beep at you and the light's going  

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:37.120
to flash or if somebody's driving by you and also 
when you're in cruise and somebody is slowing down  

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.320
in front of you the car will automatically 
slow down see that made me think there's times  

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.520
in my life where i wish that's what it was like 
knowing man i'm living a second-rate life god's  

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.320
slowing me down i'm living a second-rate life 
this light's going off but i started thinking  

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.200
doesn't god do that in some ways so let 
me ask this question what do you believe  

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.880
god places in our life to help us know we're 
not living the life that he's called us to live  

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.960
what does he place in our life other 
believers that's great what else

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.160
conviction that's another one right the holy 
spirit of god lives inside of us so it should  

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.520
draw us to conviction which means something's not 
right with this situation that's good what else  

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.920
what was that the word absolutely 
anything else you guys can think of

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.480
i mean the only other thing i can say is 
circumstances right there's times where  

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.520
something happens and you go oh man this isn't 
right something's not right right and that's  

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.160
probably going back to conviction right 
but i think at times is are we even aware  

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.880
of what a first rate living could be sometimes 
i think we think we're living that first-rate  

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.280
life because we never truly experience what 
god's plan or what god's plan could be it's  

00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:02.960
because we begin to neglect his word we get 
begin to neglect other godly relationships  

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.160
people to be able to speak wisdom into our life we 
become numb to situations things like that right  

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.280
but i started thinking about this has there ever 
been a time where maybe you were more on fire for  

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:18.560
god than you are right now and maybe you've just 
got to the point of complacency or you just kind  

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.400
of let life go and you just let the motions happen 
and all of a sudden it's two years down the road  

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.320
and you're doing the same thing you haven't really 
shared the gospel and maybe you've been in and out  

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.080
of the word maybe you've been at church or not and 
it's come to this point where you know you're not  

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.320
living the life you've been called to live that 
first straight life that god has planned for you  

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.160
i know for me there's times where even 
as a pastor i go through those seasons  

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.400
and i it's just it's almost like this it's 
you guys know this you go to the ocean  

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:49.600
and you go to swim and you put down your stuff 
and you go get on the water and you have fun 15  

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:56.640
20 minutes later you look up and your stuff's not 
there where is it anybody know it's way over there  

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.880
because you begin to drift the current takes you 
down and you didn't even realize it see some of us  

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.480
may be living at that moment where today and this 
is the the part i love about god here's what i've  

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.840
been praying because god's been speaking directly 
to me that today's message is what you need  

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:21.360
to recognize you've drifted there's something more 
for you than the second rate light for your living  

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.200
and that today's a day that you need to begin 
to deal with that and here's the cool part god  

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.840
has never left your side god is saying i'm here 
i've always been here i've been here when you  

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:38.000
drifted and i'm ready to reach my hand out and 
help you get back up to where your stuff is to  

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.880
where my plan is for your life and i think that's 
just so encouraging when we think about that  

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:50.640
god won't let us stay where we are right he'll 
put things in place maybe days like today with  

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.800
this message to get our lives back in line with 
him i think that's really cool that god loves us  

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.960
that much god desires for us to live a life with 
purpose and you know i don't know about you guys  

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.400
um but when i start thinking sometimes 
about what is god's plan for my life  

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.000
and there's been a lot of big moves us 
moving to cincinnati was like a big move  

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.200
to say okay we made a big step god i mean isn't 
that enough but it wasn't just you make a step  

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.440
of faith and then you stop you continually make 
steps of faith and so for me at times it gets  

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:29.520
scary because to live a first-rate life to live a 
life that god's called us to live just like jonah  

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.480
he's gonna have to turn the other direction and 
he's gonna have to go to people that he may not  

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.600
like and he may have to preach the message 
that he's not excited about preaching and  

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.720
he may go to a land that is desolate he may go 
to a land that is destructive i don't know what  

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.520
turning back and living a first-rate life looks 
like for you but it may be difficult god's never  

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:54.720
promised life to be easy he's promised life 
with him present despite your circumstances  

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.440
so yes it can be scary but we go back 
to and i love where we started this  

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:07.200
how do we begin to know how to live a 
first-rate life how do we do it community  

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:15.520
following jesus actively living out our faith 
alongside other believers trusting the lord  

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.480
because that's who we are as a church that's 
why we have a church and the church is not just  

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.840
sunday morning the church is look around this 
is the church this is why we have each other  

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:31.760
to challenge each other to go live our lifestyle 
for jesus see i see jonah in this situation and  

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.080
jonah didn't have anybody around him other than 
people who didn't know the lord what if jonah just  

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:42.160
would have had a friend next to him maybe his 
his story would be different i don't know but  

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.160
here's one of the things i wanted to mention is 
at times when we see storms come into our life  

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.880
we can get frustrated that god would 
allow that storm to come in our lives  

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:55.280
why lord why would you do this i mean i don't 
know about you i've asked that question before  

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.360
why would you allow the storm to come into 
my life we thank god are you punishing me  

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:07.120
but here's the truth going back to 
hebrews god's discipline is actually love  

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.240
because he doesn't leave you in 
that condition if you saw someone  

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:20.080
walking off a cliff because they had their 
head turned wouldn't you scream and say stop  

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:26.720
wouldn't you run and tackle them even if they got 
bruises on their legs and their arms so that you  

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:32.560
could save their life see that's what god's doing 
god is running after you and he doesn't care what  

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:39.440
it takes to get you to live the life that he says 
is best for you that's how much god loves you  

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.120
god sees so much potential in you that he 
won't leave you in your second great condition  

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.880
we should be very afraid though when god doesn't 
pursue us and you're saying wait wait there's  

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.920
times where god just lets us live our lives 
however we want yeah when we absolutely reject him  

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.760
when we absolutely reject him and we say no and 
what i'm talking about here so you understand this  

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.080
i truly believe if you've given your life to 
christ that you cannot lose your salvation now  

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.840
again depending on who you are i don't know your 
stance on that here's my conviction with this god  

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.800
says that he is the one that gives us salvation 
and if he gives it the only way that we can lose  

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:23.520
it is if he took it away we can't do anything 
to lose our salvation so here's the clear part  

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:30.000
though if we choose to reject god i don't believe 
we ever truly accepted god if we choose to reject  

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.520
god i don't truly believe we ever truly accepted 
god so when god disciplines us he's discipline us  

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:40.160
as children if god's not disciplining us we are 
not his children that's what he's saying here  

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.120
and he's saying you know at times and this is in 
romans 1 16 through 25 and i don't have time to  

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.240
read it but one of the things that it says here 
in verse 25 of romans it says they exchanged  

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:57.600
the truth of god for a lie and worshiped and 
served what was created rather than the creator  

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:06.960
as people have given themselves over to creation 
not the creator and so when god is bringing storms  

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:12.720
into your life it's a sign of love not hatred 
same thing for jonah so here's the other thing  

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.480
our second-rate living who does it affect

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:24.560
i think at times i remember as a kid my mom 
and dad smoked and i'm not against smoking so  

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.160
if you're smoker that's not what i'm i mean i 
am but i'm not like saying hey you're a sinner  

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:34.560
if you smoke but what i am saying this they said 
well this doesn't bother you yet they were the  

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:40.560
ones where in the back seat were choking over 
their cigarette smoke this is only affecting me  

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.720
many times in our lives our second rate 
living we think well it only affects us  

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:53.920
it's not true let's see in the story of jonah how 
that's not true let's look at verse 5. so verse 5  

00:23:53.920 --> 00:24:00.160
says the sellers were afraid and each cried out 
to his god they threw the ship's cargo into the  

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.680
sea and lightened the load and then meanwhile 
it says jonah had gone to lay down to the lowest  

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:11.840
part of the vessel and then stretched out to fall 
asleep see jonah didn't care he was able to sleep  

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:18.800
he didn't care who he you know brought 
into this he was sound asleep so the  

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.240
sellers were afraid they even cried out 
to their own idols right their own gods  

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.040
they ended up throwing their cargo into the sea 
to try to save their lives and jonah's lives  

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:38.320
the cargo was meant to be sold so they gave up and 
lost all of their cargo because of jonah living  

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:46.640
a second-rate life their lives were in danger 
because of jonah's second-rate living they had  

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.760
lost all these things and one of the interesting 
things is they tried everything else they could  

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.400
rather than going to the one true god and maybe 
it's because they didn't know the one true god  

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.840
they did everything they could in 
their own hands to try to fix this  

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:05.200
what what about us if we're not living a 
first-rate life that god's called us to live  

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.920
who are we affecting i want you to think about 
that when you don't live your life out the way  

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.960
god's planned who are you affecting so let me give 
you some scenarios i decided to create a couple of  

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.600
these i don't know if these are true or apply 
to you but obviously i'm i'm encouraging you to  

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:30.400
seek the lord in what does apply to you so dad if 
you're a dad in this room if you don't treat your  

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:37.440
wife your kid's mother the way that god has called 
you to as christ loved the church who's affected  

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.840
well one your spouse because 
she's not seeing christ in you  

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.200
if you have a son it's your son 
learning how to treat his future wife  

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.840
if it's your daughter your daughter's seeing 
how i guess she should be treated in her  

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.480
future relationship so that's a that's a quick 
one i mean that's pretty easy to apply so  

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.320
man if we're not living our lives out the way 
god's called us to us as husbands we're affecting  

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:09.440
so many people because of our secondary living let 
me give you a second one substance if you focus on  

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.960
getting drunk or you're focused on something 
that that gives you your fix whatever it is  

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.640
and you're saying oh this doesn't affect 
anybody else ask any kid that grew up in a house  

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:28.080
that their father or their mother was a drunk and 
they'll tell you different they'll tell you it  

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:35.920
is drastically effective meaning they affected 
their family tremendously yeah let me give you  

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:41.280
another one here what about this what about just 
not living your life out for jesus how does that  

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:47.360
affect those around you if you don't prioritize 
what it means to live your life out for jesus  

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:53.040
your first rate life who does it affect well if 
you have kids number one your kids will follow  

00:26:53.760 --> 00:27:00.080
you and how you live your life out for jesus 
your co-workers your other family members  

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.680
your neighbors those whoever activities 
you're a part of if you aren't living your  

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:12.160
life out for god you are affecting whether 
they experience the true love of god so  

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.400
if it makes sense here and guys this is where 
i believe that god has given us a clear word  

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.800
from jonah's life is man living our 
lifestyle for jesus is not just a personal  

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.440
it's a personal decision but 
it's not just a personal effect  

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.600
sometimes we get it all right which means every 
day you study your word and every day you pray  

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.640
but you forget living your life out in a way that 
honors people or honors god around other people  

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:45.600
and so it can affect other people i think 
too many times we live as our life as though  

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.120
it doesn't matter but here's what 
i do know and so you guys know if  

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.840
you know the story of jonah well enough 
you'll say hey but doesn't it work out  

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.440
and let me read these verses so because 
we'll get to these verses later but  

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:01.600
in verses 14 down i'm going to read these it says 
so they speaking of the settlers after they threw  

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:06.080
jonah off the ship it says so they called out to 
the lord please lord don't let us perish because  

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:11.120
of this man's life and don't charge us because 
of the innocent blood for you lord have done  

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:16.240
just as you pleased and then they picked up jonah 
and threw him off and the sea stopped raging and  

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:20.800
the men were seized by great fear of the lord and 
they offered sacrifices to the lord and made vows  

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:27.360
so if you want to read this text and you want to 
go hey so my direct disobedience to the lord as a  

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.600
second-rate life can lead people to faith in jesus 
because these people i mean they saw the lord  

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.080
nowhere let me just be clear 
nowhere in the word does it say  

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:44.960
to live a disobedient life so somebody can come to 
faith in jesus but does it happen does it happen  

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.080
where somebody who lives that disobedient life 
other people experience god absolutely but they  

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:54.320
experienced god because of the lord disciplining 
jonah and they just happened to be in the area  

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.240
so by the grace of god these people got to 
experience god and i'll give you just a little  

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:04.080
bit of a life experience or example with this is 
um we're not proud of it but brittany married me  

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:10.800
as an unbeliever she was a believer i was an 
unbeliever and look at where we're at i mean can't  

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.600
god do that to anybody that marries an unbeliever 
he could her sisters have asked that question to  

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:23.120
her um with some some guys that they were going 
to marry and didn't work out um and we just told  

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.040
him hey we could promote hey yeah i'd work out 
i mean it worked for us but we didn't we said no  

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.120
because here's the thing that we share with 
them we could have avoided a lot of hurt  

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:37.360
and a lot of brokenness if we would have got 
that relationship right at the beginning so  

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.240
don't count on your second-rate living as though 
god's just gonna miraculously use that to bring  

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:47.840
people to faith in jesus it's it's not it's not 
valuable to think that so here's the here's the  

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:52.400
last thing that we're going to talk about is who 
does god use to speak to us about our second-rate  

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.400
living a lot of times you know we talk about 
the other believer we talk about the word of god  

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.720
but have we ever thought that it could be 
somebody who doesn't know jesus that actually  

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.640
really gets our lives back on track and this is 
where we see this in verse six it says the captain  

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.120
approached him and said what the heck are you 
doing sound asleep that's basically what he said  

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.000
i bet he was probably yelling calling him a fool 
i don't know but it sounds pretty crazy he says  

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:23.120
get up and call to your god and maybe this god 
will consider us and we won't perish see god uses  

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.320
sometimes the lost world around us those who just 
don't know jesus around us to really speak to us

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.280
and i think that the reason why they do is there's 
there's two reasons is one they're just they've  

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:41.680
got logical sense of understanding the condition 
that you're in is desperate but maybe the reason  

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:47.120
why they're speaking to you in such a way is 
because they're negatively being affected thinking  

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.960
going back to the last point sometimes we're 
negatively affecting people who don't know jesus  

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.640
and they're trying to speak truth in our 
life and we don't want to hear it because  

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.240
we're not a follower of jesus and god's 
like no i'm using them to speak to you  

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.000
so jonah wasn't just physically sleeping but he 
was spiritually sleeping he needed to wake up  

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.720
and so god used this captain to speak to him 
and he used these words he says get up and arise  

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:17.280
or call out to your god and when you look at 
really in the bible this word arise or get up  

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:23.280
it's generally used in a calling of god for 
people to get up and properly represent him  

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:29.200
so god used someone who didn't even know 
him to speak to jonah's life and say get  

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:35.120
up and represent me the way you should get up 
and arise and represent me the way you should  

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.880
see i think of ephesians 5 14 we walked through 
the book of ephesians recently and it says this  

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.760
it says get up sleeper rise up from the dead and 
christ will shine on you that's exactly what that  

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:51.120
seller was saying to jonah see our community 
our co-workers our friends our families are  

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.880
asking each one of us to get up and arise and 
live the life that god's called us to live not  

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:02.400
a second-rate life just getting through not just 
trying to make it on grace and what i mean by that  

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:08.960
is a lot of times we just justify our disobedience 
with grace when god is saying that's not your best  

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:17.680
it's not your best i remember this and i'm i'm i'm 
coming to a close here so you guys know when when  

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:23.840
i met warren uh which is the guy who allowed us to 
be able to make a connection here at pathway great  

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:30.240
guy used to be a pastor here locally he told me 
that this principal told him this this statement  

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:39.200
one day warren where's the church in the schools 
and when warren told me that i began to thank god  

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.960
because god's called us here to impact this 
community through the schools that's was  

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:50.560
our hearts desire but i just think about this it 
took maybe somebody who has lost a lost principle  

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:57.520
asking where's the church for us to really get the 
picture of man why aren't we living our lives out  

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.640
in the schools why aren't we 
living it out in other places

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.240
so i don't know about you guys but i know 
whenever i think about what does it look like  

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:13.360
to be the church it's to live a first-rate life to 
live within the will of god and the purpose of god  

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.840
that he has for you so i'll go back to this and 
so you know hey do we uniquely figure this out  

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:22.000
no we just use the word of god to figure out who 
we are as a church as a church we have committed  

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:30.000
to inspire hope by helping people by helping you 
discover your purpose through a relationship with  

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.920
jesus the only way that you'll know what god has 
planned for you is if you pursue a relationship  

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:42.080
with jesus that's where it starts that's where 
it ends that's the middle that's the quarter  

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:48.800
way that's the three quarters way it's all way 
through jesus and i love this as it ends verse six  

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:55.440
the seller says this maybe this god the one 
true god will consider us and we won't perish  

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.880
how many people that we live around 
is searching for the one true god  

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.840
to move in their life to 
save them from their storm

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.640
we have the answer we have the ability to live 
the life that the world needs to see the question  

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:20.000
is will we live it that's the question i ask 
you today will you live it will you allow god  

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.760
to use you to live a life that brings honor to him 
and brings people to jesus and so you know this  

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:36.000
and this is just kind of a challenge we don't work 
for salvation we work from salvation so if you're  

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.760
wondering well ben are you telling me because 
i'm not living this first-rate life that that  

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:44.320
i'm not saved because i'm not doing enough that's 
not what i'm saying because the only way that you  

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:49.760
can live a first-rate life is because of what 
christ did christ has done everything for you to  

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.920
be able to live the life he's called you to live 
and if you begin to depend upon yourself so that  

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.560
justifies you before the lord you've missed the 
point you don't work for salvation you work from  

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:04.560
it which means as you've given your life to jesus 
now god begins to use his power in you to go work

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:12.000
so don't let this weight of living a first-rate 
life rely on your shoulders it's really on  

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.040
jesus working in and through you through a 
relationship with him so how do you respond  

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.920
to divine interruptions let me just end with 
this first thing that we learn from this is  

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:27.920
don't get mad if you are in a storm maybe god's 
using this message to to draw you to conviction  

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:33.680
don't get mad don't get mad the storm is a 
way of god getting your attention he's got a  

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.920
better way for you to live we should respond with 
thankfulness we should respond by taking his hand  

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:46.080
during the storm and allowing him to 
help us begin to live the life that he  

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.680
has planned for us to receive his grace 
and mercy and take the next right step  

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.400
what is the next right step here in just a moment 
we're going to have a time of invitation and  

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:58.800
every church has some form of a time of invitation 
and i don't think we explain it well enough what  

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:04.880
is the purpose of invitation it's inviting each 
person not just people who don't know jesus but  

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:11.920
each person to take a next right step so you get 
a time to just consider lord how did this message  

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:17.360
speak to me how did the conversations i had 
between people and their conversations speak to me  

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.040
and so here's just a couple ways that maybe god's 
speaking to you and ways to follow through with it  

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.240
number one salvation maybe you've come to the 
realization that you haven't given your life  

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.840
to jesus and if if you haven't don't freak out 
as though oh gosh i've been found out or i just  

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.240
no this is actually a good thing because 
you recognize your need for jesus  

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:44.240
at here at inspire and hope we celebrate people 
who need or want or desire to come to faith in  

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:49.600
jesus and you can do that today through coming and 
talking with me my wife brittany will be over here  

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.360
i'll be in the back during invitation you just 
come back there and say hey can you you tell me  

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:59.520
what does it mean to follow jesus um i would love 
to talk with you um maybe here's one is baptism  

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.680
you know a lot of times we we give our lives to 
jesus and maybe it's not this one special moment  

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.200
where we recognize that we've given our lives 
to jesus but we've never followed through in  

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:12.880
believers baptism and what is what is believers 
baptism it is baptism after salvation again  

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.720
i've had this conversation with people hey i got 
baptized as a child well did you give your life  

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:23.600
to jesus as a child and you got baptized 
after or did you give your life to jesus  

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:28.880
later on in life but you were baptized before why 
does it matter it's a matter of obedience it's not  

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.920
a matter of your salvation whether you're saved 
it's a matter of obedience to the lord so maybe  

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:37.360
your next right step is to get baptized on the 
right side of your salvation and that is honoring  

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:42.000
to the lord and that's a way for you to publicly 
declare i want to follow jesus in every area of my  

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.160
life and this is a great first step so if you 
have questions about being baptized come talk  

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:52.320
to me after service we can do that that's a great 
thing that god honors and we celebrate as a church  

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:57.680
but here's the next one is maybe it's none of 
those things and you just are wondering hey ben  

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.280
what what is my next step here's where i'm at my 
faith i'm not going to have all the right answers  

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.640
but i'm willing to walk with you and talk with you 
about maybe a next right step maybe that's a time  

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.960
to get into inspire group maybe that's the time 
to begin to serve the lord where you live maybe  

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.040
that's the time to where you get more dedicated 
to your time in the word i can help with that  

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:22.960
that's what i'm here for is to help you follow 
jesus better but i know this every one of us has  

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:29.440
a next right step during this time of invitation 
ask the lord what it is and respond with yes  

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:38.880
let's pray lord jesus you are god and we are 
not and lord today we recognize our need for you  

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:43.840
more than ever because lord the storms 
in our lives sometimes are there just to  

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:48.320
to grow us in our faith lord but sometimes the 
storms in our life are to draw us back to you  

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:55.440
and lord we just pray that you give us guidance 
through your word today lord through conviction  

00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.160
maybe through another believer maybe through 
someone who doesn't know you lord may you give us  

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:07.680
what we need to make that step of obedience 
towards you to live the first rate life you  

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:14.160
have planned for us in your will to help others 
know you and to help us know you more god we thank  

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:19.520
you so much that you speak to us through your word 
and the lord that you give us a group of people to  

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:23.520
come together to encourage one another to do life 
even though we know at times we are not living the  

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:28.320
life maybe you called us to live but but others 
to come alongside us to encourage us in our faith  

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.040
but god i just pray that if there's someone in 
this room that's struggling to take that next step  

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.560
if there's someone in this room that's struggling 
to take this next step lord of salvation that you  

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.640
help them stand up and have the faith to say yes  

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:46.720
lord don't let them leave today before they make 
that decision lord we love you and we thank you  

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:50.960
again for this time and what you're doing in 
our church and in each one of us here lord today  

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:58.080
and we just give you honor and praise and glory 
for it we pray this in your heavenly name amen
