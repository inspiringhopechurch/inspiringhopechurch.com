00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:43.840
um

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.840
yes

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.840
um

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.800
i guess i would say is um you know church service 
my people come to her services it's like okay  

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.640
we're going to have music we're having somebody 
who's going to preach right so those two things  

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.400
are very important right here but i think one 
element that is missed sometimes it's fellowship  

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.840
connecting and so wanting to give space to do 
that in the middle of service before service after  

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.960
service that's one of the things we talk about 
every morning on sunday lunch we come in as a team  

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.960
at nine o'clock and we talk about the importance 
of connecting because god has designed us to  

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:20.880
connect and to encourage one another and to pray 
for one another and so i love being with his face

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.400
what would i say is that this gives you 
opportunity to even process maybe what god is  

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.920
talking about um invites you into walking through 
this text and so we have been walking through the  

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.840
book of ephesians so if you've got a bible you go 
to ephesians chapter 6 um starting in verse 10 if  

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.040
you don't my encouragement is two things on your 
way out we have bibles on our next steps table  

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.720
number two download the the holy bible app 
or the you version that's one of the greatest  

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.120
apps to keep with you to bring them to you if 
you don't have a bible and don't have a phone  

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.840
i'm going to have i believe behind you so you'll 
see it behind me um before we jump in i just want  

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.640
to mention this as i just was thinking through 
this week um and we're moving today just to be  

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.280
honest i'm just really excited about what god is 
doing and what god is going to do in the days to  

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.840
come i'm excited to be working with this mission 
team this week it's going to be a great weekend

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.040
maybe that's for you remember you're reflecting on 
what god has done for you um and so this is what  

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.400
i've heard this is you know in my belief that 
god's going to continue to do amazing things in  

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.400
our church we're still new right we just launched 
three months ago it's this idea that god has so  

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.560
abundantly pursued me called me and saved me if he 
has done that right individually and god has done  

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.960
that for me that you can do exceedingly abundantly 
more than i can ask for thank you that's actually

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.920
where he talked about what he desires god 
desires to do exceedingly abundantly more  

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.560
than we can think and so it's that belief that i  

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.040
have to remind myself that god 
is doing something and god's

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.720
i was talking about this again to our 
team earlier but ephesians chapter 6 at  

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.400
this point is concluding the book we've been 
in this book since january um but it's just  

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.520
paul saying his word finally so he's concluding 
the same chapter i've told you all these things  

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.520
finally hold on to these things and this is what i 
believe he's going to share with us today and next  

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.200
week until we finish the rest of this this chapter 
is this idea that we don't fight for victory  

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.080
i'll say that again we don't fight for victory 
we fight from victory so let me explain that a  

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.040
little bit everybody knows that anybody goes into 
a battle let's just even get into the sports world  

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.120
um you watched the fights last night maybe i don't 
know if he did it once last night each one of  

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.720
those guys went into fights and if you don't know 
what i'm talking about it's mma they fight anyways  

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:55.680
they win in both of them to fight for victory one 
came out victorious if we are following jesus we  

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.720
walk into everything before we start how's that so 
because it's not dependent upon us it's definitely  

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.800
through jesus on the cross and that idea is so 
important especially as we walk into the biggest  

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.360
tips because what we're going to realize is every 
person is in a battle every day every person is in  

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.920
a battle every day whether you're right or not 
you'll walk into one and it's about for your  

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.680
life for your soul uh for what your your desired 
purpose is in this this world and in this life  

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.960
and the question is who's going to win see 
god's already one it's whether we believe it  

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.760
we proclaim it we put on our full armor as we'll 
talk about and we walk into life victorious or  

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.400
whether we allow the enemies to pass that's on 
us god's already given us accepted and followed  

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.080
through and so in these final verses paul's not 
introducing anything new what i love about this is  

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.680
when you walk into this book and paul is sharing 
things like this let me just kind of share this  

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.160
paul shared this in the first three chapters 
god has done everything for you he has given  

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:10.560
everything to you salvation life security power 
love grace mercy unity with other people then he  

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.360
talked about hey this is what it looks like with 
other people and relationships we talked about  

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.000
what it looked like in unity marriage and with 
your kids and with your job which was last week  

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.880
so all these things kind of come to this point 
we're also not talking about anything new  

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.800
in the verses we're going to cover he's 
actually affirming to use these verses to  

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.120
really encourage us and so all of these verses 
that we're going to cover in the final chapter  

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.880
6 some of you may have heard the armor of god 
right and i know that the youth of the youth did

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.040
until next week so hold on and the 
reason why is because we need to know  

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.960
who we're fighting if we're going into battle we 
need to know who we're gonna find so let's take  

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:03.760
some time to read this again ephesians chapter 
six um starting in verse 10 13 it says this  

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:12.960
finally be strengthened by the lord and by his 
vast strength put on the full armor of god so  

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.000
that you can stand against the skins of the devil 
for our struggle is not against flesh and blood  

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.360
but against the rulers against the authorities 
against the cosmic powers of this darkness against  

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:29.040
evil spiritual forces in the heavens for 
this reason take up the full armor of god  

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:35.040
so that you may be able to resist an evil day and 
having prepared everything to take your stand so  

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:44.640
let's take some time to pray lord jesus um we are 
the lord just asking for you to to help us as we  

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:50.640
read the word i pray that our hearts and our minds 
are open to what you have shared this word we know  

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:57.440
that your word is truth and uh something that we 
can apply to our lives or help us see it and um

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.880
so questions anybody ever had a 
dream where you went to school

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.840
here's the thing here's something

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.600
but what i'm trying to to help get in the process 
this idea is god is giving us a full armor to put  

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.720
on every single day ever since then we're 
going to talk about what that foreigner is  

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:51.440
but he's giving us this to protect us against 
but again there's times and i'll just there's  

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.960
times i get in the midst of my day and i look 
down and i realize i did not invite god but not  

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:03.360
invite this armor into my life and so because 
of that all saying hey don't miss this this is  

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:09.840
so important remember this every single day so he 
starts off here i love that and finally really is  

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:16.640
paul summarizing everything he just said you know 
he's saying just make sure that you do this right  

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.640
and i love this word he says to be strengthened by 
this vast strength you know i think about this um  

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.520
those of you who know me i work out right 
through the race and i start thinking my kids  

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.080
tell me this all the time hey dad show me your 
muscles right and i'm strong right to my kids  

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.000
but that's not anything compared to god's 
vast strength you know that's like laughable  

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.280
to think that i'm strong enough apart from god 
to really defeat the enemy that is in my life  

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:52.800
and my strength isn't even comparable to god's 
strength and he says this vast strength is really  

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:59.760
it's a great extent of quantitative terms right 
so he won't run out and i i think about this  

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:06.080
over and over again because in the middle of my 
workouts i run out of energy yesterday i was going  

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.400
to work out with tea and outside i couldn't do 
more push-ups like i was done i ran out of power  

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:20.000
and strength but see god has faster god doesn't 
run out of strength and see that's encouraging  

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.200
we should be encouraging to you as well as 
in the midst of the battles that we face  

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:36.320
maybe in school maybe in our homes to pay for jobs 
physically in our marriages whatever it is god has  

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:42.640
the ability to overcome with his bachelor so 
whenever you ran out of strength he asked he's  

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:51.040
just hitting his heart i love that idea of this 
vast strength and so his strength um can withstand  

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.680
attacks and so let me ask this question i 
know this may just be a practical question  

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:02.880
but i want us to all get this idea who needs god's 
strength so you tell me who needs god's strength  

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.840
right that should be an easy answer 
everyone needs to have strength  

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:17.520
how many people who think that they're strong 
maybe they think they're strong enough to handle  

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:24.000
them around do you think that they still need 
that strength here here's the thing though have  

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.520
you ever gotten a situation where you had it 
all figured out you didn't even tell anybody  

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:37.840
see that's us rejecting someone else's 
strength that's us rejecting god's strength

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:49.680
it's only those who realize they're weak who will 
ever receive god's strength see that's the part i  

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.960
love about god god doesn't force anything on us 
see a lot of times we think of god as this god  

00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.160
that forces us into these situations this is what 
we have to do no absolutely not you don't have to  

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:05.440
you get to you have the opportunity to it's your 
choice but god so loves you that he's extended  

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.320
everything to you we're talking about embrace love 
and mercy right every one of us whether we realize  

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:18.960
they're not um need god see we were born into sin 
right sin is anything that we think say do we're  

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.720
so you know we're pretty much doing that 
throughout the day whether we probably recognize  

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:30.320
that or not so we're right at that point we have 
been separated from god but god said that's not  

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.360
good i'm not happy with that separation he 
says i'm going to send my son jesus to die  

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.040
on a cross for you because the only 
way to be forgiven of those sins  

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.360
is to be punished for them and whether that 
must be punished god said i'll punish my son  

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.000
jesus who will receive all the punishment 
of your sins and my sense of the rest of our  

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.880
lives that we have right and at that moment 
god says i've extended this gift to you  

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.560
to receive my son as the replacement of your 
understanding right to be forgiven of your sins  

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:06.800
and to be able to receive this strength but day 
after day even believers day after day will reject  

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:13.920
his strength because this is what they say i'll 
come to you on the big things but i got it anybody  

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.360
ever said that i mean maybe not out loud but we 
know you thought i know i thought god i'll invite  

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:26.400
you in on the big things but that's not who god is 
god says that he works greatest in jesus right and  

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:32.800
so we need to realize this before we can even move 
forward is why do we even need strength from god  

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.920
well because we have an enemy that is pursuing 
us an enemy that wants to defeat us and uh  

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.200
when you start talking about the enemy 
in the bible i didn't kind of go really  

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.520
there's an enemy called the devil and there's 
all these principalities and those things  

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:57.840
the truth is there is it's 
hard to compromise but it is

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.960
when i get sick i don't want to go to the 
doctor because i don't need to go to the doctor  

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.960
when i have a project i need to do i'm going 
to do it on my home because i don't need help  

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.160
except friday i asked me because 
i didn't know what i was doing  

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.680
but most of the time i'm saying i 
don't know how to do these things  

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:28.880
you know where that's got me alone really sick 
and further behind my projects it's not healthy  

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:36.480
so we're looking at this who needs strength 
whether they realize that they're weak or not  

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.680
everyone needs got strength because we have an end 
we're all in a battle and we're in a battle with  

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:51.280
one victory i like winning games i am competitive 
well so does god he wins every time i love that  

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:59.360
so how do stand against all the things that paul 
talks about here let's look at verse 11 here so  

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.520
again so he says finally be strengthened by the 
lord revise that strength in verse 11 says this  

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.000
then put on the full armor of 
god so that you can stand against  

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.680
the schemes of the devil and so this idea of 
standing right we know that when you're in  

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:21.840
i don't sometimes you get knocked down but god 
says he wants you to stand in the greatest ways

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.920
what is that well here's what we 
realized is he talks about this  

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.360
schemes right he says you should put 
on this whole arm so that you can  

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.480
stand against the schemes the devils you 
anybody know what the word schemes means

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.560
it's good anybody else

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.240
basically he's right he's 
working ways to try to treat you  

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.960
consistently so in order to be able to reject the 
schemes of the devil which is this what little  

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:16.000
battles that are going on in our lives in order 
to reject that we have to put on the full armor  

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.760
of god and so here's i'm going to mention these 
things but we're going to come back next week

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.960
these are the armors that he talks about is how 
we are strengthening this threatening on this  

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.680
armor is the belt of truth the breastplate of 
righteousness the sandals of the gospel of peace  

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.800
the shield of faith the helmet of salvation 
and the sword of the spirit why didn't he  

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.720
just say things easier than that i don't 
know but he wanted to get this imagery  

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:44.960
of this armor and i think of you 
know i'd rather honor i think

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.240
right i mean this is logical i'm trying to build 
this case in my head so as you guys can hear me  

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.880
share today as a pastor i spend time studying 
god's word you know how does this question  

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.880
what makes sense to me or do you think it's 
totally different than how i'm presenting it  

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.760
you're going into a football game you'd be 
crazy not to put on all these protections  

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.720
right the shields these cards all these 
things so if we're going to defeat our enemy

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.080
and it's the same idea with the lords that's 
when you put these things on you feel stronger  

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:48.080
you realize you have the ability to be all the 
things that you have in your life but the only  

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:55.840
way we'll realize that we need this honor is if we 
understand that we have anything right so who is

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:14.080
harry potter the one who shall not be named i'm 
like why don't you just say his name like who  

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.960
cares like he can be named it's not gonna change 
anything right it's good to name your enemies and  

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:26.480
sometimes we don't because he realize behind he 
wants to scheme against us right so his name is  

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.520
the devil and so if we're going to fight for 
victory we need to learn to walk in that truth  

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.920
right but we have victory every battle we want 
but god's already defeated the devil we need to  

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:43.920
be strengthened by god's power right and when 
we're fighting it's important to understand  

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:50.720
our enemy any good commander going to bow is 
going to study how his enemy fights because  

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:56.400
then he knows how to do thinking so us it's good 
for us to know so let's look at our names right  

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:04.400
here in verse 12. this is where it kind of is 
okay this is real and the truth is so it says  

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:10.000
this for our struggle is not against flesh and 
blood but against the rulers and against the  

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.720
authorities and against the cosmic powers of this 
darkness against evil spiritual forces in heaven

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:23.520
first thing we address who are in this amount 
so somebody tell me who is not our enemy

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:35.280
each other because i'm telling you this i've 
been in enough rights arguments with my spouse or  

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:42.400
someone else and we have to kind of laugh after i 
don't know why because we realize it's even trying  

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.880
to fit us against each other because that's not 
god's design god's design is not for us to like

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:06.640
and i think back to whenever paul was talking 
about marriage whenever you do get married he says  

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:12.560
you're one right you're one and what that means 
is at that point if someone wants to look at you  

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:17.120
you shouldn't be two different people that 
you should be one and you should not be  

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.520
departed if that makes sense and so 
as couples just a thing here as you're  

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:27.280
fighting each other you're actually fighting 
yourself like that's really how paul explained  

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.920
you're fighting each other you're arguing with 
each other you're you're fighting yourself so  

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.520
here's what paul does he says i'm going to 
take a step up you're not fighting against  

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.520
other people you're fighting against all these 
things that are controlling these people right so  

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:47.120
when you look at a person you say hey i'm 
frustrated both of you need to go to the  

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.360
lord right remember this study that i said 
when it comes to your marriage go to the lord  

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.960
and come back together and we'll talk a 
little bit more about that is as we kind of

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:16.800
should before each other because if not they're 
distracted from the real enemy so this is this  

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:23.760
other idea is sometimes we're fighting the 
wrong battles so step out there some of you have  

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.120
arguments and fights with your boss 
some of you having with your teachers  

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:37.760
or other friends and you're arguing with them 
you're so frustrated and the truth is right and  

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:43.200
the enemy's trying to divide and we all need to 
realize in this moment hey let's stop fighting  

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:49.120
each other let's invite god into this conversation 
and let's deal with it in a way of defeating any  

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:55.040
knowing that we have victory over wherever that 
was and it talks about this this is interesting  

00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.320
when we look at this is um it's different 
when you look at it from the perspective of  

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.440
people right when we think okay paul's speaking 
to this text to believers so between two believers  

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:12.480
we shouldn't be fighting but what do you do if 
somebody else has another lord what do you do  

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.720
maybe it's maybe it's you maybe you don't know 
the word maybe somebody else knows the word  

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:23.040
how do you not fight against each other well 
it's this idea again that anybody that doesn't  

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:29.920
know christ is controlled by the enemy and this 
is where ephesians 2. this is this is a tough one  

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.360
there's anything for me to think back to i want 
to bring this ephesians 2 you guys want to go back  

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:42.320
there verses 1 through 4. those who before christ 
um this is how we lived or if maybe you don't know  

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.400
christ this is how you're living and this is god's 
word and i know sometimes it's tough to come here  

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.640
expense and this is something i want to talk 
through but he says this before christ he says  

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.920
and you were dead in your trespasses and sins in 
which you previously lived according to the ways  

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:01.040
of the world according to the ruler of the power 
of the earth and the spirit now working in this  

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:06.000
opinion we all too previously lived among them in 
our fleshly desires carrying out the inclinations  

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.960
of our flesh and thoughts and were by nature 
children under that as the others were also  

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:18.560
here's what those verses say anybody apart from 
christ is actually controlled by the devil within  

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:26.560
him right he's on that side he's working against 
god and it's not that idea that's where we all  

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:32.320
have to stay is that idea of really god saying 
that is where we were controlled so when we  

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:37.920
allow the enemy to to divide us so it's 
believers we're going back to our old nature  

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.640
we're allowing the enemy when we're going back 
to the other side but how do we handle it if  

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.960
someone doesn't know christ here's the thing 
the same way our enemy is not that person  

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.560
our enemy is satan he's the devil he's the 
one that's trying to control and manipulate  

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.280
situations so we love people i don't care what 
the relationship is with jesus or not love him  

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:02.640
we're not here to be creative and this is one 
of the greatest things that i mentioned here  

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.120
is sometimes our fightings look different right 
when it comes to someone we don't know if they  

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:12.800
know christ or not um maybe we should be careful 
how we post on social media if we don't know  

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.760
where someone is at and i mentioned social media 
because that's one of the greatest places i think  

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.240
a lot of us feel in power right now you probably 
don't know what twitter is instagram right fill  

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.960
out power to say what you want and then all of 
a sudden you realize you know what my that's

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:45.040
familiar with the adventure movies this is going 
to be a great one ready for this do you remember  

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.480
where some of the avengers were controlled 
by their minds were controlled and it was  

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:56.240
tough for the other adventurers to fight against 
them because they knew that it wasn't truly them  

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.240
fighting them it was the person who's controlling 
them if that makes sense to you or maybe you don't  

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:06.400
know avengers i'm sorry you missed the reference 
but it's important because i think about this  

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.840
guys that's exactly what it is when we're fighting 
against people rather than against the true enemy  

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:19.040
of the devil we're missing the point and we need 
to to understand that god is giving us the power  

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:26.000
of faith so that's the first thing that's not 
that easy is each other right but then he goes on

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.520
then he goes on he says um you know again all 
these principalities and these authorities and  

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:40.080
these cosmic powers which are so um outside of my 
brain continue to comprehend it god clearly gives  

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:45.040
us the details of who we're going to need right 
um so let's just kind of walk through this leader  

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:50.640
is the devil you know he has many different names 
but the devil means accuser another name is satan

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:02.800
um a couple of different places in the bible 
talks about who he is he's a tempter in matthew  

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:08.640
4 3 he's a murderer and a liar in john 8 44 
he's compared to a lion in first peter 5 8  

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.360
and a serpent in genesis 3 1. so the enemy plays a 
lot of different roles and has a lot of different  

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:20.800
i guess things that is recognized as him but the 
one thing that we do know that this is important  

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.480
is in the beginning satan was a creative being 
right so he's not god he's not all-knowing he's  

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.600
not all controlling and i think at times 
we allow the enemy to say he's everywhere  

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:38.000
we can control god know god allows things to 
happen to you but it's for a greater purpose  

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.840
to test you or to bring you back to him and 
so nowhere that the enemy goes is available  

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:52.640
for you to give you strength right we'll talk 
about this honor and so how does god accomplish

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:56.720
so much

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.240
how does the devil accomplish so much across 
the whole world and this is where we look at  

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:09.920
there's multiple helpers where it mentions you 
right it's not just one if you go to revelation  

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.000
i think it's revelation 12 he talks about whatever

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:25.440
so he has other people on his team but there's 
still a bigger army and a bigger guy who  

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:31.600
defeats our enemy and so he calls them rulers 
and authorities and cosmic powers and darkness  

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.440
uh and this is the enemy that we're 
against right where are they located  

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.840
in the heavens or in the spiritual 
rounds that we cannot see  

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:43.440
so i don't fully understand all of them i don't 
really understand but i do understand this  

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:48.160
whenever i am battling it's not against you 
it's not against my brothers and sisters  

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:54.320
it's against the dead that's against anything that 
we sometimes can't physically see but he's better  

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:01.840
so it's not um again another person i think 
that's important for us as we go through when  

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.560
we walk through this armor and then the next 
few weeks is that we understand that we are in  

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:14.720
a battle not with each other right but that with 
another enemy so how do we fight against i think  

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.320
that's the the thing how do we fight against our 
treatment and before we get into the full armor  

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:25.840
of god we really see that god reminds us that 
it is the floor for god that will completely  

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:32.400
control or be able to resist so he says that in 
verse 13. for this reason take up the harmony so  

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.520
that you may be able to resist an evil day and 
having prepared everything to take your stand  

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.800
see whenever i think about this is paul is 
affirming something you hear somebody say it  

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.680
once right i'll give you a great example my 
son when we had something hot on the stove  

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.080
i was going to tell him hey watch 
out don't touch anything on the stove  

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:58.560
but because i know my son i know he's three i 
typically tell him about two three four nine times  

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.760
to make sure he does because i don't want him to 
touch the stuff see paul did the same thing right  

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.160
he said be strengthening the lord his father and 
put on this form of god right then he talks about  

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.800
who the enemy is it's the devil and it's all these 
principalities and all these things and he says  

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:19.680
for this reason take up the form of god it's paul 
affirming that is the only thing that will defeat  

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:25.920
sin is taking up the form of god satan must be 
a strong ending we have to take before right not  

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:31.200
just partial honor and i think that's the part too 
at times it's like we'll pick up the shield but we  

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.640
don't need anything else no god's saying before 
complete honor of god and he uses those schemes  

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:41.600
to write against us these cunning acts and this 
is where he's talking about to be able to resist  

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:49.760
so one of the sadie's greatest tactics is the 
twist truths anybody remember when jesus uh  

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:55.040
after he was baptized into the lives of 40 days 
40 nights didn't eat anything and then the enemy  

00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:00.800
came and said he came and he began to try to 
tempt him to seek him with what remember what  

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:08.320
the bible the word and jesus said basically you're 
twisting this let me give you the truth and so he  

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:15.840
quotes that truth to me and basically that life 
right this is the greatest way that the importance  

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:22.480
it takes a little bit of truth and you'll twist it 
so god has given us the word of truth and this is  

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:29.600
something i think i've encouraged you before and 
now get in order don't just take my word for it  

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:35.840
get in the word because god individually wants 
to listen he wants you to know the word and as  

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.960
you know the word and anything that i share you 
can come up to me and say hey something doesn't  

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.800
sound right and we can sit down and talk about 
it because i'm glad to be on the counterweight

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:55.120
so when we are listening to others filter 
it through the word of truth so that's just  

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.600
one of the things we're going to talk about 
about the truth next week but like that's  

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.720
one of the things that he uses where he 
likes to deceive us and twist these truths  

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.960
so god has given us everything we 
need to defeat the speeds of the devil  

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.800
and we're going to talk about all those 
things i know we've made a lot of time  

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.560
today and just walk through every bit of the 
armor so take time this week to read through  

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:20.400
all the armor that god gives us to be able 
to stand against our enemies the question is  

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:27.840
do we all have enemies yes we do they're 
not our flesh and blood but really true

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.320
i think one of the hardest things to 
realize we started watching the chosen  

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.000
series last night if you guys haven't 
watched that it's a really good series  

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.640
but it was this moment where mary had 
went back to our former way of life  

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:57.040
she became not married mother mary she came to 
jesus this instance where she said i can't do it  

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.040
this is what mary said she said i can't do it 
and jesus looked at her and said no you can't  

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:07.200
but i can't um he says i don't request 
muslims she said well basically

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.520
where i realized how much god loves us like just 
that picture of watching that part of the episode  

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:30.160
god loves everyone with so much and we sometimes 
complicate what it means to come into faith in  

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.360
jesus as though we have to bring a perfect 
record to god and if we don't i can't give  

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.000
my life to jesus that was me for a solid year of 
my life until i realized i'm never going to be  

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.240
good enough i've got to come to jesus bro just 
like mary did on the show that we're watching  

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:50.880
and i have to say i'm sorry and i have to ask 
about it god you know he's not going to hang

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:09.760
mission is to inspire by helping people 
discover god's purpose for their life  

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.800
for a relationship with jesus we really 
believe god has a specific purpose for you  

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:21.840
for you not just for this church but for you that 
will only happen through a relationship with jesus  

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:27.600
and so as we take time to go through this type 
of invitation usually sing a song it's not just  

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:32.160
for us just to sit there and sing a song watch at 
least in the song it's really for us to consider  

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:37.520
what god is speaking to us and i wanted to 
share some truths that i know god speaks  

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:43.680
to us through his word god loves you he created 
you he desires a personal relationship with you  

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:51.280
he ran after his greatest creation even 
though he's in the history he provided a way  

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:59.280
for us to be saved to live in the 
future we don't fight before we fight  

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:06.720
letting this foreign stop say your wrestling 
was maybe the way that you've been living  

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:11.600
and you are christ's father today's day a great 
day repentance asking god for you that's what it  

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.960
means to jesus you don't fully know what that 
means you don't have to know all the answers  

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:32.720
you just have to realize this if you don't 
mind just take a minute there close your eyes  

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.360
mention a few things for you to ask the 
lord before we go to this kind of invitation

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:45.200
if god has given you everything to 
overcome your enemy and your dating battles

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.960
then you need to ask this question

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:57.840
and i just i just challenge you ask the lord 
right now in your heart lord have i certainly

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:08.000
maybe in your heart god will answer that and 
say yes or no here's another question lord  

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.840
have i ever asked for you to forgive my sins

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:29.600
so i don't know what god spoke to you 
in those moments maybe god said yes  

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:37.120
to everyone else maybe there's a couple work i 
did here's my encouragement for you if you haven't  

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:43.840
given your life to jesus and surrendering your 
life if you haven't ask for forgiveness if you  

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.400
haven't allowed god to fight your battles today is 
the day of the salvation today is the day of jesus  

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.320
here's what i want to offer 
is during this time invitation

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.720
i just want to talk to anybody who 
needs prayer i want to talk to anybody  

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.600
that needs just encouragement i want 
to talk to anybody that needs to give  

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.040
their life to jesus desires to talk more 
about what that means in the life of jesus

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:17.040
because i know the god who loves me who 
saved me so desires to know you personally  

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:24.480
and so when i pray just stay with me

your life to jesus just come talk to us  

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:35.840
so lord jesus thank you lord for 
today uh lord i have today maybe  

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.440
just a tough text lord to even think through 
and process through that we would even need  

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:45.200
this vast strength words to be our enemy in 
the devil and that there is even such a thing  

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.480
as an enemy that has principalities and powers 
and things that we just don't fully understand  

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.440
but lord we know that word is true that we 
understand that we do have an enemy that's greater

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:05.920
than um we're just the person sitting next to 
us that we may be frustrated so lord you haven't  

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:11.760
left us though without the ability to overcome 
this thank you lord for a full honor of god  

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.960
and lord i pray for each person this reward if 
they've given their lives to you lord that they

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.520
what they need to do or maybe it's repentance 
or maybe it's just reminding themselves to  

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:30.480
pick up a couple of pieces of armor a day put 
them on we're not praying for the person's room  

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:34.400
for this wrestling through what it means 
to give their lives to jesus and that they  

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.040
take time their expectation to come back 
and talk to me and talk to to bring me  

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.440
um and just say hey i have questions we're going 
to pray for that person today they're bold enough

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.600
there's nothing something that's 
the word we just pray all these

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:16.800
things you
