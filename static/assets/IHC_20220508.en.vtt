00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.880
And we do, like at times we'll just
do a topic or an idea or a theme.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.000
Um, and so the question is why do
we walk through books of the Bible?

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.575
And the, and the thing is for
me, You don't skip anything.

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:16.845
So there's always the texts that you're
like, ah, you know, we could skip this.

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:20.025
This may not be valuable for us right
now, or, and that doesn't mean much to

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:24.735
me, but for us, it allows us to go over
everything and to be able to learn things.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:28.365
And so today is an interesting text and
it's not that it's a bad text itself.

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:31.814
We're going to talk a lot about, uh, how
to minister to widows within the church.

00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:33.915
What sort of thinking, how many
widows do we have in our church?

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:37.335
From my count zero widows, our church.

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:40.395
Now we have, um, a lot of women
in our church, but no widows.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:41.385
So now w what do we do?

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:42.585
How do we take this knowledge?

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:44.265
Well, for us, it's one learning.

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:47.055
We might have widows in our family
because it does address how we handle

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:48.885
taking care of widows in our family.

00:00:48.885 --> 00:00:53.115
But it also, it sets us up for success
to remember, as we have what it was

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:55.965
in our family or in our church, how
do we handle taking care of them?

00:00:55.965 --> 00:00:58.425
And so we have some things we can
learn today, but I say all that to

00:00:58.425 --> 00:00:59.715
say is, you're going to find this.

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:01.295
Bible reading right?

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:05.105
Every day that you read sometimes
if you've ever got to, is it the

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:08.615
book of numbers where all it is,
is these names genealogies, right.

00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:10.655
And you're like, or these
numbers, and you're like,

00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:12.245
what's the purpose behind this?

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:16.685
And it's always this reminder that
it's in there to build usually a case.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:17.735
If you're talking about all the geneal.

00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:22.455
It's helping you see the
lineage of Jesus, right?

00:01:22.455 --> 00:01:24.404
The goal is to the point to Christ.

00:01:24.404 --> 00:01:27.434
And so all these things that we have
in the Bible are beneficial for us.

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:28.664
So that's one thing I want to talk about.

00:01:28.664 --> 00:01:33.854
The other is something that I can get you
get caught up into in days like today and

00:01:33.854 --> 00:01:35.955
really what we've been dealing with the
last couple of weeks and what we'll deal

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:40.934
with in the weeks to come is, uh, Paul
is writing to Timothy in this portion

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:45.244
of the text to talk to the church about
how the church should conduct itself.

00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:49.655
People of God should live
their lives out for him.

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:53.165
Well, what we can really get caught up
in, and this is one of the things I know

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:56.585
over the last couple weeks, and I'll
even think about today's text is we work

00:01:56.585 --> 00:02:01.265
really hard on becoming better people,
but we're doing it for the wrong reasons.

00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:04.805
So we try to become better people
to try to justify ourselves to God.

00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:07.115
When in essence, that's not
what Paul's talking about.

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:10.745
Our justification before the Lord
is what Jesus did for us by grace

00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:13.865
and mercy, which means we can't
do anything to earn God's love.

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:14.275
God gave.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.630
To us.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.859
And we accepted that.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.859
But the things that we learn about
how we should conduct ourselves as

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:25.019
really what we talk about is how we can
help ourselves look more like Christ.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.130
God has saved us through Jesus
to experience a life that is

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.179
more and more like Christ.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.060
And that will help us now fall away
from our faith, not be deceived by

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.190
false teaching, which is what we've
been talking about in this text.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.019
Here's the other key part so that we will
model and display the life of Christ.

00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:44.895
To those around us.

00:02:45.615 --> 00:02:51.345
And I talked about this last week
is we are basically showing people

00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:53.105
around us, what we truly believe.

00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:57.734
By how we act now, sometimes we
say something and we do the exact

00:02:57.734 --> 00:03:00.285
opposite and you hear that being
somebody being a hypocrite usually.

00:03:00.315 --> 00:03:00.615
Right.

00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:02.295
And you hear that within the churches.

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:05.385
Oh, that church or those people are
filled up full of hypocrites wise.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.484
Cause typically what the church
will do is it will say one

00:03:07.484 --> 00:03:08.625
thing and it will live another.

00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:11.715
So Paul is trying to drive the church.

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:15.375
He's telling Timothy to tell
the church, lead us, match our

00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:17.595
conduct to the message of the God.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.250
So today we land where we are with this
idea of how to conduct ourselves in the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.110
church in a couple of different ways.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.440
One of those is, and how we will
conduct ourselves in the church

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.870
towards younger and older believers.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.260
But then we'll also talk about how we
should conduct ourselves in meetings.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:35.790
The needs of widows.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.270
And so just to kind of catch you up
just in the last week, um, we've been

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.630
talking about the importance again, of
how we conduct ourselves in this area.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.740
One because of how we display the gospel
to those around us too, because it

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.540
builds one another up by how we live.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.270
So if, if we're living worthy
of the gospel, those in the

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.630
church are inspired or encouraged
to live their lives that way.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.630
And then he makes this statement
at the end of chapter four,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.490
about how we should evaluate.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.690
Our conduct because it may reveal
a false belief in our life.

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:07.299
So we know we talked about this.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.779
We are consistently, uh, around false
teaching, whether we know it or not,

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:14.829
and this is what we always want to know.

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.860
We, we think false teaching
will display itself.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.149
Clearly.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.010
That is not true.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.620
It will usually be covered in some form
of truth, which means we start believing

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.240
something because will that person.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.390
So it's gotta be right.

00:04:31.049 --> 00:04:34.289
Or that person, you know, he's got
a couple of degrees he's right.

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:34.979
Or she's right.

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.919
Or, you know, and so we, we start
thinking, things are true when

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.760
they're covered really with that
truth, but there's, there's,

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:42.900
there's false teaching under it.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.109
So I say all that to say is we
need to evaluate our lives and

00:04:46.109 --> 00:04:49.830
how we're conducting it so that
we know, Hey, is this truth.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.570
And when we evaluate it, we evaluate it
against the word of God and whether it

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.930
would represent Christ well, and when
we do that, it allows us to realize.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.710
Push out the false truths and align
our lives with Christ so that we

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.520
are displaying our lives in the way
that would be worthy of the gospel.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.000
Right.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.060
And so we're going to continue that
theme to those two things we had talked

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.360
about is, uh, how we address older people
and younger people in the church, how

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.740
we conduct ourselves towards widows.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.430
But I want to ask this just, and
it's going to be a little bit

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.100
more of a question that I want
to drive a little bit deeper.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.150
It seems like Paul is taking a
big section check section of this

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.980
to talk about our conduct in the.

00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:31.295
And how we really even conduct
ourselves just around one another.

00:05:32.075 --> 00:05:37.175
Why do you think Paul would spend so
much time speaking that to the church who

00:05:37.175 --> 00:05:39.635
should have the spirit of God inside them?

00:05:39.635 --> 00:05:39.875
Right.

00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:41.705
So if we have the spirit of God
inside of us, which means Christ

00:05:41.705 --> 00:05:44.585
inside of us, we're in the church,
the church is a good place to be.

00:05:44.585 --> 00:05:47.945
Why is he spends so much time
about how we should conduct

00:05:47.945 --> 00:05:49.055
ourselves around one another?

00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:50.225
Why do you think that's true?

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.610
Yeah.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.050
And how we were treat each other.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.420
We'll actually even be more of a
reflection of how we'll treat others.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.980
If we can't treat one another, well
here, how are we going to do out there?

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.140
And I've asked this question.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.290
If you've been a part of a church that's
ever had issues where it seems like

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.010
people are biting at each other and
fighting, or there's, there's some kind of

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.740
conflict there's conflict in the church.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.050
It needs to be dealt with why?

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.110
Because if we can't deal with it here,
we ain't gonna be able to deal with it.

00:06:25.245 --> 00:06:27.645
So it's so important that
we deal with it here, right?

00:06:27.645 --> 00:06:29.594
Because it really reveals our true heart.

00:06:30.525 --> 00:06:34.005
And so we want to make sure that our
conduct matches that of Jesus had

00:06:34.005 --> 00:06:37.935
displays to those around us in the
church and in our lives who Christ is.

00:06:37.935 --> 00:06:38.775
So let's jump in this text.

00:06:38.775 --> 00:06:39.945
So we're all in the same place here.

00:06:40.335 --> 00:06:44.805
We're going to be in first Timothy
chapter five and we're covering the

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:47.805
first 16 verses a lot, but we'll
break this down and I'll go quick.

00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:48.854
I promise to not keep you too.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.320
And I also promise that the
guys won't be back there longer

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.490
than they have to as well.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.990
But here's what it says, starting
in verse one, it says don't rebuke

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.690
the older man, but exhort him as a
father, younger men, as brothers, older

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.670
women, as mothers and younger women
as sisters with all purity, he says

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.950
support widows who are genuinely in.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.180
But if any widow has children or
grandchildren, let them learn to

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.440
practice godliness towards their own
family first and repay their parents

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.470
for this pleases God, the widow who
is truly a Nene and left all alone has

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.570
put her hope in God and continues night
and day in her petitions and prayers.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.150
However, she, who is self-indulgent
is dead even while she lives, command

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.440
this also that she will, uh, that she
will be, or that they will live above.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.980
But if anyone does not provide for his own
family, especially for his household, he

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.740
has denied the faith and is worse than an.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.310
No widow is to be enrolled in the list
for support, unless she is at least

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.990
60 years old has been the wife of one
husband and is well-known for good works.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.340
That is if she has brought up children
shown hospitality, wash the Saint's

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.960
feet, help the afflicted and devoted
herself to good work, but refuse to

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.770
enroll younger widows for they are
drawn away from Christ by desire

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.580
that they will want to marry and will
therefore receive condemnation because

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.720
they have renounced their original.

00:08:16.755 --> 00:08:20.625
At this same time, they also learned
to be idle going from house to house.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:24.914
They are not only idle, but they are
gossips and busybodies, same things.

00:08:24.914 --> 00:08:29.685
They shouldn't say therefore, I want
younger women to marry, have children

00:08:29.715 --> 00:08:34.755
manage their households and give the
adversary no opportunity to accuse us for

00:08:34.755 --> 00:08:37.275
some have turned away to follow Satan.

00:08:37.755 --> 00:08:40.875
And if any believing woman has widows
in her family and let her help them

00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:45.405
let the church not be burden so that
it can help the widows and genuine.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.360
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.380
We just ask Lord that you open our
hearts and minds, Lord to what you want

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.160
us to know today, Lord, what we can
apply to our lives and what we can use.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.880
Um, Lord, towards being a
church that represents you.

00:09:00.209 --> 00:09:03.870
Um, Lord, not only to one another,
but to those outside of the church.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.430
And so we pray this in your holy name.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.440
So the first thing that Paul
addresses and chapter five is how

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.170
we should conduct ourselves towards
the older and young believers.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.330
And I'm going to kind of group the
older, young believers together.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.650
We're not going to spend a ton of time
on this, but we see here where he talks

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.590
about the older men and the older women.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.600
So really what Paul is saying.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.480
He wants us as a church to be respectful.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.770
And he's speaking to Timothy as well.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.130
Right.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.950
But he's saying as a leader
and as people in the church,

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.240
we should be respectful to all.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.730
Believers, no matter the age.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.709
So with the older people, right.

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:42.120
Since Timothy was younger, it
would be easy for him to ignore.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.730
And so we all know this there's
there's these clicks, right?

00:09:44.819 --> 00:09:46.740
Nobody wants to call
it out, but typically.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.020
People tend to hang out with
people of the same age or the same.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.280
Hey, we have kids.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.790
So when we begin to do that,
sometimes what happens is we begin

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.560
to prefer one group over the other.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.550
We begin to distance ourselves from
an older generation or a younger

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.410
generation, because they're not like us.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.050
They're not cool or they're immature.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.230
So what Paul is saying is everybody
has benefit in the body of.

00:10:10.275 --> 00:10:13.995
Don't show preference to one or
the other because of your age

00:10:13.995 --> 00:10:15.314
or because of what you like.

00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:22.545
And so he says here to not rebuke older
men, but to exhort them as fathers, right?

00:10:22.574 --> 00:10:25.935
Don't be rude to them in speaking, even
to mothers, because he says this older

00:10:25.935 --> 00:10:27.885
woman as mothers, don't be rude to them.

00:10:27.885 --> 00:10:31.005
Don't don't pick on them,
don't leave them out.

00:10:31.035 --> 00:10:34.665
But show respect, encourage them as
though they are your father and mother.

00:10:35.025 --> 00:10:38.895
And this is what I would say here is
understanding the older generation.

00:10:39.615 --> 00:10:41.235
Has lived a longer life.

00:10:41.265 --> 00:10:42.915
They have more experience.

00:10:43.395 --> 00:10:48.225
So what I would say is we need
more Dave and Stephanie's right.

00:10:48.225 --> 00:10:50.535
We need more people to
come into our lives.

00:10:50.655 --> 00:10:51.765
More people like you guys.

00:10:51.765 --> 00:10:54.525
And I'm not calling you out as like,
as though like only old people.

00:10:54.525 --> 00:10:57.375
But I would say we are a church that
lacks an older generation that I would

00:10:57.375 --> 00:10:59.865
say we crave for more older generation.

00:11:00.195 --> 00:11:04.995
Not because we just want to be
diverse in that we really believe

00:11:04.995 --> 00:11:07.065
that the church as a body gains.

00:11:08.145 --> 00:11:09.315
From the older generation.

00:11:09.345 --> 00:11:11.505
So that's what Paul is challenging.

00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:15.255
Timothy don't build a church that only
reaches a younger generation, even though

00:11:15.255 --> 00:11:18.585
we need to reach a younger generation,
we need to be a church that reaches

00:11:18.915 --> 00:11:20.865
and includes the older generation.

00:11:20.925 --> 00:11:22.125
So respect them.

00:11:22.305 --> 00:11:22.665
Right.

00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:26.285
So that's a good side,
but here's the other side.

00:11:26.405 --> 00:11:30.465
And I'm now starting to get to this age
where I might start thinking the younger

00:11:30.465 --> 00:11:35.715
generation, is this an immature group
of generation, which sounds so funny.

00:11:35.715 --> 00:11:38.310
Cause I'm like, I know,
I love you Carlene.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.300
I love you Carlene.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.140
Right.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.760
But why is he saying, look at
the younger generation and look

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.410
at them as brothers and sisters?

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.260
Well, when I think of the
younger generation at times,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.800
I think of immaturity, I think
of maybe weak in their faith.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.520
And sometimes what I would say is
they could come across annoying.

00:11:57.329 --> 00:11:58.050
I love you guys.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.360
So here's what's happening.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.020
So you understand this, the word
of God is speaking to my heart

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.370
to say, Hey, they have benefit.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:06.100
They have.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.300
It's important to, to love them as my
brother and sister, which means this it, I

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.260
don't have any younger brother or sister,
but if I did, I know this is a younger

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.750
as the youngest child, they loved me.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.330
They supported me no matter how young
I was now, they were a little bit

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:26.100
rude to me and probably for a good
reason, but we should treat them.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.890
What I would say is they need more
tender, lover, care, love, and care.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.590
Sometimes they need to
be brought up built.

00:12:32.715 --> 00:12:34.335
And so we need to not look down on them.

00:12:34.335 --> 00:12:36.075
We should treat them as
brothers and sisters.

00:12:36.585 --> 00:12:38.505
So Paul is urging us, right.

00:12:38.505 --> 00:12:44.385
And Timothy to conduct ourselves in a, in
a way that is honoring right to, to, to

00:12:44.385 --> 00:12:47.625
the Lord and the way that we serve them
and care for them in the church, no matter

00:12:47.625 --> 00:12:49.425
how old or how old they are, how young.

00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:50.595
Right.

00:12:50.775 --> 00:12:52.695
We should not play favorites.

00:12:52.935 --> 00:12:54.105
So that was his challenge in here.

00:12:54.105 --> 00:12:55.905
So that's a quick excerpt there.

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:58.365
Paul's making sure he's addressing this.

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:01.425
And so now we're going to transition
to this idea of how we should conduct

00:13:01.425 --> 00:13:03.525
ourselves towards widows in the church.

00:13:03.525 --> 00:13:03.765
Right?

00:13:03.765 --> 00:13:07.275
And here's the key theme to
this verse three and verse

00:13:07.275 --> 00:13:09.345
16 is the key idea to this.

00:13:09.795 --> 00:13:10.785
And here, I'm going to read those to you.

00:13:10.785 --> 00:13:13.395
Verse three says, Timothy, basically.

00:13:13.395 --> 00:13:15.785
I want you to support
widows who are genuinely in.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.960
And then he ends that portion of it.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.730
In verse 16, he says, let the church
not be burdened so that it can help

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.530
widows who are in genuine need.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.800
So the reason why he's writing this text
is he's saying the church is supposed to

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.280
meet the needs of the church specifically.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.740
And if you'll even go into James 1
27, it talks about that we should

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.230
minister to widows and orphans.

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:43.800
Right?

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.230
And so that's a, that's
a ministry in itself.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.969
So as a church, we want
to be able to do that.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.250
But what he's saying is we need to
meet the needs that are genuine.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.319
And I would even say that as
a church, we're going to dive

00:13:55.319 --> 00:13:56.069
a little bit more into that.

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:57.660
What is a genuine need in the church?

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.260
How do we do that?

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.579
And so Paul doesn't leave us hanging here.

00:13:59.579 --> 00:13:59.939
Right?

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.400
So let's talk about the first
group that he talks about.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:02.579
Right?

00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:03.900
So he's talking with the older widows.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.040
How do we.

00:14:06.405 --> 00:14:08.324
Conduct ourselves towards
the older widow widows.

00:14:08.505 --> 00:14:12.735
So we know this, if you've studied enough
in the book of acts, book of acts six is

00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:17.475
whenever the, they appointed the apostles
appointed deacons to meet the needs of

00:14:17.475 --> 00:14:20.505
widows because they were not being met.

00:14:20.505 --> 00:14:22.275
The needs were not being met well.

00:14:22.305 --> 00:14:23.444
And so they appointed these deacons.

00:14:23.444 --> 00:14:26.625
So they wanted to make sure that
they had a ministry for, so Paul's

00:14:26.625 --> 00:14:27.944
continuing that thought, right.

00:14:28.515 --> 00:14:33.105
But when we think about this and he
says that we want to meet genuine needs.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.480
Paul is saying to be
careful with our resources.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.080
And I wanted to bring this up as a
church, one of our key values, as

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.300
we talk about wise generosity, as
we were thinking through what is,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.440
what do we want to be as a church?

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.530
One of the things I wanted to be as
a church is to be generous, which I

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.950
think is a great thing, but I think
there's wisdom in it, which means this.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.890
We need to meet the needs
that are not being met in our.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:57.130
Right.

00:14:57.209 --> 00:14:58.560
There's things that already been met.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.800
Let's let those continue to be
mad, support those people, but

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.180
let's meet the things that are not.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.420
And so you see us going into different
avenues where we feel like that there

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.140
are gaps in our community, and now we're
not looking to somebody else to meet

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.310
those needs, but we're meeting those.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.969
But I would also say that within
our church for one another, as

00:15:14.969 --> 00:15:17.459
we see opportunity to serve, we
need to look for those that are.

00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:22.395
And coming out of a church background
in Oklahoma, I was approached, I

00:15:22.395 --> 00:15:24.495
was over benevolence at our church.

00:15:24.915 --> 00:15:29.295
I was approached weekly with
needs that would come in and

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:30.165
there would be a request.

00:15:30.225 --> 00:15:31.725
And there'll be a couple of
questions that I would ask.

00:15:31.725 --> 00:15:35.895
Number one, is this a one-time need or
an ongoing need of as an ongoing need?

00:15:35.895 --> 00:15:38.415
We said, Hey, could we
give financial counseling?

00:15:38.985 --> 00:15:42.105
You know, can we help you
find a job most of the time?

00:15:42.135 --> 00:15:42.555
Not all.

00:15:42.555 --> 00:15:46.095
Most of the time we were a response
back is it is a consistent.

00:15:47.385 --> 00:15:51.585
And we're unwilling to get a job and we
don't want financial counseling to me.

00:15:51.585 --> 00:15:53.385
I would go back to, there's not a genuine.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.050
That's hard to tell somebody,
no, why isn't it a genuine need?

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.640
Because they're refusing to get a job.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.820
The refusing counseling that
may help them be able to attain.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.580
We were willing to help along that
if they would take that journey.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.140
But most of the time they're not.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.660
So that's exactly where Paul's
talking about here, right?

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.000
Is that we need to meet genuine needs.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:16.260
So he sets up these qualifications
to say, how do we know if we should

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.090
meet the genuine needs of widows?

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.080
And so he uses this and specifically
in verses four and eight.

00:16:23.334 --> 00:16:26.905
He says to meet the needs of widows who
don't have other people to support them.

00:16:26.905 --> 00:16:31.314
So verse four says, but if any widow
has a child or grandchildren, to

00:16:31.314 --> 00:16:34.735
let them learn to practice godliness
towards their own family and repay

00:16:34.735 --> 00:16:39.055
their parents for this pleases God,
something to kind of note here.

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:43.435
Paul is also dealing with an a time
with context is important a time

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:45.265
where there was not social security.

00:16:45.925 --> 00:16:47.875
There was not this ability for retirement.

00:16:48.354 --> 00:16:49.854
So Paul is speaking to a time when.

00:16:50.564 --> 00:16:53.985
Majority of widows once they lost their
husband and they could not meet their

00:16:53.985 --> 00:16:57.584
own needs, had a genuine need not today.

00:16:57.885 --> 00:17:02.505
So, you know, if there's widows out there
that does not able to meet their genuine

00:17:02.505 --> 00:17:05.115
need, even though they have some security
doesn't mean, well, we say you have social

00:17:05.115 --> 00:17:06.135
security, you can meet your own needs.

00:17:06.315 --> 00:17:08.744
We still need to meet
those needs as Sharon.

00:17:08.774 --> 00:17:10.155
This is where I want to speak to you.

00:17:10.635 --> 00:17:14.534
You may not even be thinking about this,
but you may have widows in your face.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.180
And maybe you didn't understand
that part of your role as a Christ

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.829
follower is to help meet those needs.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.930
And we understand that's difficult.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.120
Oh, maybe I didn't know that
that was something for me is

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.140
how does this apply to me?

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:30.160
Maybe there are some widows in my family
that I can begin to meet those needs.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.620
And so he's speaking
directly to that group.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.270
So it doesn't relieve that burden.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.090
So here here's the reason why I
want to read John 1335 is one of my

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.810
verses that I've shared a lot, but it
says this, it says by this, everyone

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.520
will know that you are my disciples.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.230
If you love.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:49.350
Speaking of what Paul's addressing in
the church is that we model what it

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.760
truly means to be a follower of Christ
is by the way that we take care of

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.570
widows in our family, by the way we
take care of widows in our church, we

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.110
are showing other people who Christ is.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:05.010
And I've said this, I've used
this word a lot, this idea behind

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.750
permeate or perfume, right.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.470
You know, this, when grandma walks in the
room, you know, she's here because you've,

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.060
where's that tea that Dick perfume.

00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:18.165
So think about this when the church
is doing a good job of ministry, not

00:18:18.165 --> 00:18:20.205
only the widow's needs, and this is
why I want to dive a little bit deeper

00:18:20.205 --> 00:18:22.755
for our church, because we may not be
able to be meeting that need right now,

00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:27.255
but meeting the needs of one another,
it becomes something that's talked

00:18:27.255 --> 00:18:31.185
about outside this church, and it
permeates the air where somebody says,

00:18:31.245 --> 00:18:32.535
I want to be a part of that community.

00:18:34.285 --> 00:18:40.055
Paul is saying, if we do a great job,
Of ministering to one another, we

00:18:40.055 --> 00:18:42.365
will influence the world for Christ.

00:18:42.665 --> 00:18:48.275
It will invite them into the room to be
taken care of and be a part of helping

00:18:48.275 --> 00:18:51.575
take another period care of other people
because of what Christ has done for us.

00:18:52.325 --> 00:18:54.725
So that's so important that we see that.

00:18:54.725 --> 00:18:58.175
So verse eight though is very direct
and this is what verse eight says it

00:18:58.175 --> 00:19:02.135
says, but if anyone does not provide
for his own family, especially for

00:19:02.135 --> 00:19:06.185
his own household, he has denied the
faith and is worse than an emblem.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:07.770
Wow.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:08.940
That's a tough one.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.950
It's really challenging believers to
say, if new you neglect your family's

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.110
needs, you're worse than an unbeliever.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.690
And I want to ask this question
because I think it's important.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.390
We hang out here for a minute and make
sure we're all on the same page with this.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.940
Why do you think it's worse for a
believer to not meet the needs of

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.150
their family than an unbeliever who
doesn't meet the needs of their family?

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.690
Somebody answered that.

00:19:37.925 --> 00:19:39.905
What's that you should know better.

00:19:40.925 --> 00:19:43.505
See the difference between a believer
and an unbeliever is the believer has

00:19:43.505 --> 00:19:46.475
the spirit of God living inside him,
which has conviction right with the

00:19:46.475 --> 00:19:52.415
conviction and the word of God to guide us
towards meeting the needs of the church.

00:19:53.465 --> 00:19:57.185
But when they neglect the spirit
of God and the word of God and

00:19:57.185 --> 00:19:58.925
choose not to obey his word.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:02.699
Then one who is an unbeliever who
doesn't have the spirit of God who

00:20:02.699 --> 00:20:06.629
doesn't have the word of God that doesn't
know any better and see that this is

00:20:06.629 --> 00:20:08.100
something I want to stop right now.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.360
And I want to dive back out into it.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.620
If you have sin in your life as
a believer and you're refusing

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:19.080
to repent of it, it is worse than
an unbeliever refusing to repent.

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:22.979
Why an unbeliever may have not come
to the conclusion with the word of God

00:20:22.979 --> 00:20:24.209
and the truth of the God in their life.

00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:27.735
Now again, they're still accountable
to their sin, but I would say this as

00:20:27.735 --> 00:20:32.535
an a believer, if we're refusing to
repent, we know it, we recognize it.

00:20:32.535 --> 00:20:33.375
And we're refusing.

00:20:33.735 --> 00:20:36.825
It is though we are rejecting
what Christ has done for us.

00:20:37.185 --> 00:20:38.655
That is a challenging statement guys.

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:42.045
And I, I, I want you to see this
to not miss that whole picture with

00:20:42.045 --> 00:20:45.255
that, but it is true when we're
speaking obviously to family and

00:20:45.255 --> 00:20:46.185
something else I want to mention.

00:20:46.185 --> 00:20:50.445
This is, as we do, as families, as we do
meet the needs of widows or other people

00:20:50.445 --> 00:20:53.145
in our family, here's a challenge to you.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:55.750
Don't complain about it.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.840
You ever hear the statement
when you complain about doing

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.360
something for somebody, but
you're like, Hey, I'm doing this.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.600
You're looking for a pat on the back
and you're looking for sympathy.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:06.220
You've lost your reward.

00:21:06.429 --> 00:21:07.750
You've lost the benefit of it.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.010
So when you meet these needs,
do it with the joy, do it as

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.600
though you are serving the Lord.

00:21:13.629 --> 00:21:14.710
The Bible talks about that.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.500
Do everything as though
you do it unto the Lord.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:18.970
I'll tell you this.

00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:20.500
That's why I can scrub toilets.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.399
I don't like cleaning beds.

00:21:22.845 --> 00:21:26.055
But when I'm, I'm cleaning toilets
and I'm washing sinks and it's not

00:21:26.055 --> 00:21:30.795
all the time, but when I do, you know,
what I would think of this is serving

00:21:30.795 --> 00:21:32.385
the Lord by also serving my wife.

00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:35.835
So sometimes we do things
that are difficult and hard.

00:21:35.835 --> 00:21:40.815
It doesn't mean that things are difficult
and hard, you know, that, that, you

00:21:40.815 --> 00:21:42.015
know, you wish it wasn't, but it is.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.410
But it's because you're doing it
to serve the Lord through that.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:46.770
Right.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.800
So don't complain about it
because you'll lose your reward.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.260
And I just, I've been around
several that have done that and

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.510
that I just, I laugh sometimes.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.160
So he goes on here, right?

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.570
The qualifications was one widows who
don't have other people to support them.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.780
Number two is widows
who are faithful, right?

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.400
Let's look at verse five through seven.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.420
It says this.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.320
It says the widow who is truly
in need and has left all alone.

00:22:11.415 --> 00:22:15.735
Has put our hope in God and continues
nine day and your petitions and prayers,

00:22:17.835 --> 00:22:22.755
Paul saying that there's going to be
widows that have needs all over, but

00:22:22.755 --> 00:22:26.355
women who are committed to Christ
women who wouldn't I'll give him,

00:22:26.355 --> 00:22:28.035
give this Galatians six, 10 says this.

00:22:28.035 --> 00:22:31.515
It says, therefore, as we
have opportunity, let us work

00:22:31.515 --> 00:22:33.285
for good for all, if we can.

00:22:33.885 --> 00:22:37.395
But Paul's saying, but especially for
those who belong to the household of.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.110
These are women.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:45.990
He's saying that meet this qualification
or women who love Jesus, who are basically

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.960
committed to him day in and day out.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.110
And so does that sound harsh right?

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.750
To only be committed to
those women and to help them?

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.560
Here's what he'll say is he's saying
that when you meet their needs,

00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:59.790
they're not going to waste it away.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.480
They actually have a genuine need
because they're relying on the Lord.

00:23:03.929 --> 00:23:04.980
I always tell people this.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.685
I love whenever people talk about,
Hey, You know, we're praying right

00:23:08.685 --> 00:23:12.284
now for God to move big financially
in our life or for health.

00:23:12.465 --> 00:23:12.915
Why?

00:23:12.975 --> 00:23:16.725
Because I hear them dependent
upon the Lord, not on our sources.

00:23:17.445 --> 00:23:19.935
So in that a lot of times when
I see people are waiting and it

00:23:19.935 --> 00:23:22.514
depended on the Lord to meet a
need, I want to help meet that need.

00:23:24.165 --> 00:23:27.915
But whenever we tend to look other
directions, it really would say is,

00:23:27.945 --> 00:23:30.794
would they, even if I can help them,
would they even give God glory?

00:23:31.185 --> 00:23:34.155
And that's where Paul is sitting here,
but then we go on to verse six and seven.

00:23:34.155 --> 00:23:35.445
This is another tough part.

00:23:35.445 --> 00:23:39.900
He says, however, She who
is self-indulgent is dead.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:44.040
Even when she lives, command this
also that she will be above reproach.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.520
So Paul's pretty direct of
who shouldn't receive help.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:48.630
And here's what he's saying.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:52.350
She should not be, self-indulgent
a person who would receive help

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.480
and then seek her own pleasures.

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:59.880
And her own will over God's is one that
should not receive support as a widow.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:04.140
And so it's, it's, it's tough sometimes
when we say, Hey, we have to make.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:06.600
On who deserves help or not.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.740
When we're talking about the
church and this is not that Paul

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.440
doesn't love the person who is
struggling in those situations, we

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.090
should still minister to families.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:20.010
But we talk about this minister in
ways that doesn't cause them to be

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:24.420
dependent upon you as church, as a
church in Oklahoma, when I dealt with

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:28.080
benevolence consistently, if we were
to help every family that came in,

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:29.850
they will become dependent upon us.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.510
The church hinder the resources to be
able to meet the needs that need to be.

00:24:34.514 --> 00:24:38.085
And they would have been hindered because
they would've been dependent upon us.

00:24:38.175 --> 00:24:38.985
They would not.

00:24:39.254 --> 00:24:44.385
And we'll see this later, they would end
up caught themselves in sin, idleness and

00:24:44.385 --> 00:24:46.095
things that would not be honoring to God.

00:24:46.754 --> 00:24:50.415
So verse five, again, says that she has
to be a woman who depends upon the Lord

00:24:50.415 --> 00:24:53.985
continually and prays and intercedes for
those needs so that God can meet them.

00:24:54.405 --> 00:24:55.665
So then we jump to verse nine.

00:24:55.665 --> 00:24:56.895
What's the next qualification?

00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.905
Well, verse nine says
the next qualification.

00:24:59.715 --> 00:25:00.405
To be on the list.

00:25:00.405 --> 00:25:03.525
It says no widow is to be enrolled
in the list for support, unless

00:25:03.525 --> 00:25:04.935
she's at least 60 years old.

00:25:05.415 --> 00:25:07.125
Why would Paul say this?

00:25:08.295 --> 00:25:11.235
Well, we'll see later on that he's
going to address younger women

00:25:11.235 --> 00:25:12.135
who don't need to be on the list.

00:25:12.135 --> 00:25:16.305
It's because younger women can
remarry and receive support there.

00:25:16.605 --> 00:25:18.735
So a woman of sixties,
probably not going to remarry.

00:25:19.245 --> 00:25:22.205
And so there's a likelihood at this
point that because she's not gonna

00:25:22.215 --> 00:25:24.524
able to receive for support from her
kids, that she doesn't have any kids

00:25:24.795 --> 00:25:27.795
and she can't remarry, she's going
to need support from the church.

00:25:28.095 --> 00:25:32.085
So he uses that verse and he says,
Hey, this is probably the age range

00:25:32.085 --> 00:25:33.975
in which they're going to need help.

00:25:34.035 --> 00:25:34.455
Right.

00:25:34.905 --> 00:25:35.925
Um, but he has.

00:25:36.889 --> 00:25:39.860
Um, he's talking about this word
enrolled in, uh, we're going to talk

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.409
about this in just a minute with the
younger one, but this warden role is

00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:46.250
that these ladies would not be enrolled
just to sit there and receive support.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.280
But most of these women would
actually be part of the church.

00:25:49.429 --> 00:25:53.360
They would actually commit to
being a widow for the rest of

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.800
their life to be able to minister
alongside the apostles in this work.

00:25:58.905 --> 00:26:03.104
Um, so then the next qualification,
I'm at the verse 10, and

00:26:03.104 --> 00:26:04.455
so at least 60 years old.

00:26:04.814 --> 00:26:08.354
And it says, uh, the has
been a wife of one husband.

00:26:08.625 --> 00:26:09.044
Right?

00:26:09.495 --> 00:26:11.324
So here's another question, right?

00:26:11.324 --> 00:26:13.304
Why would he say a wife of one husband?

00:26:13.784 --> 00:26:17.534
Well, there's another key and this
is speaking directly to women who

00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:21.344
have chose divorce, not because of
abuse, but because they chose to

00:26:21.344 --> 00:26:23.024
leave the person who could support.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:27.150
For selfish reasons for
sinful reasons, right?

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.460
We're Paul's not directly talking
to the women who need to get

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.750
out of situations that are bad.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.220
Paul's also not talking to women who
have lost a husband in death, remarried

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.510
and lost another husband and death.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.230
He's really talking about women
who would be typically you would

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:44.550
call the ones that are always going
around marrying consistently and

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.860
divorcing from a sinful standpoint.

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:51.840
So he's saying women who have not, I
would say this women who have taken.

00:26:52.905 --> 00:26:55.965
Uh, the woman he's talking about,
or the woman who would have taken

00:26:55.965 --> 00:27:00.135
marriage for granted, um, and not
seeing it as a sacred from the Lord.

00:27:00.764 --> 00:27:04.274
And then he goes on in verse
10, widows who had been known

00:27:04.274 --> 00:27:05.685
for good words in verse 10.

00:27:05.685 --> 00:27:09.524
He says it is well known for good works,
that if she has brought up children

00:27:09.764 --> 00:27:11.834
shown hospitality, wash the Saint's feet.

00:27:11.834 --> 00:27:14.294
I love that one, ladies, you
better start washing feet to make

00:27:14.294 --> 00:27:15.465
sure you get on the list later.

00:27:16.395 --> 00:27:19.574
He's given us giving examples, by the
way, he's not given an exhaustive list.

00:27:19.574 --> 00:27:21.735
So, you know, I'll continue
reading here in versus.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.780
Um, uh, help the afflicted and
devoted herself to every good work.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.140
Um, and so you see this,
he gave these examples.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.720
And so if you just want to kind of
know, he's getting some of the examples,

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.010
not everyone that would qualify.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.900
That's why at the end, he
says devoted to good works.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.980
But if he says brought up children write
her own or orphan sees, she's shown

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.890
hospitality to other people by letting
them stay in her home or providing them.

00:27:44.655 --> 00:27:47.055
He's washing the believers,
believers feet, which means

00:27:47.055 --> 00:27:48.255
this she's humbly served.

00:27:48.255 --> 00:27:49.065
Other believers.

00:27:49.425 --> 00:27:52.275
She's helped the afflicted, the
ministry of the need, the homeless,

00:27:52.275 --> 00:27:55.725
the hungry, the sick, and she's devoted
to good works right works that are

00:27:55.725 --> 00:27:57.585
unto the Lord and other believers.

00:27:58.365 --> 00:28:02.685
So the resources given to these widows
were based upon not only their need, but

00:28:02.685 --> 00:28:06.645
also their past commitment to the Lord
and their future commitment to the Lord.

00:28:07.215 --> 00:28:10.095
So I, I say this again,
why are there stipulations?

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.139
Because number one, you
can't meet all the needs.

00:28:13.139 --> 00:28:16.889
The church only has a limit amount
of resources, but to those, if you

00:28:16.889 --> 00:28:19.379
were to be everybody's need, that
would become dependent upon you.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.480
And they wouldn't even be
coming with the right heart.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:25.680
And I think there's a way to address those
who you don't meet the needs that you

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.360
come alongside them to talk about how.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.070
So then he talks about younger widows.

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:33.250
This is the ones that we
would say are less than 59.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.470
So Hey, if you're in this room
and you're less than 59, I

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.670
guess you're listed as younger.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.690
Um, I would say he was actually
directly speaking to younger

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:43.000
widows probably even than 59.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:43.900
Okay.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.640
Um, but he's saying that you should not
enroll these ladies to be cared for.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.410
So here's why he re saved, refuse.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:52.490
To be cared for.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:57.320
So in verse 11, it says this, um, it
says, but refuse to enroll younger widows

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:01.429
for when they are drawn away from Christ
by desire that they'll want to marry.

00:29:02.209 --> 00:29:05.090
So naturally younger widows
would want to remarry.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:08.540
So this is what Paul's not saying again,
and this is why I think it's important.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.350
We walk verse by verse.

00:29:10.785 --> 00:29:14.415
Paul's not saying, Hey, you have
to marry what he's saying is

00:29:14.415 --> 00:29:15.585
you'll be drawn away to marry.

00:29:15.945 --> 00:29:21.225
So he's actually pointing to that to
be enrolled to this list is to commit

00:29:21.225 --> 00:29:25.875
to being a widow for life it's to
commit to when you're a widow you're

00:29:25.875 --> 00:29:29.145
receiving your needs be met, but you're
also committed to the Lord's word.

00:29:29.385 --> 00:29:31.185
And he's saying if you're
young, there's a good chance.

00:29:31.889 --> 00:29:33.540
That you won't succeed at that.

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.290
You're going to desire to
be able to go and do that.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:38.909
And so he says, I encourage you later on.

00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:40.139
He says, I encourage you to marry.

00:29:40.139 --> 00:29:40.649
Right.

00:29:41.159 --> 00:29:45.750
But then in verse 12, he goes
on and he says, and so they'll

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.850
just be a versa in verse 11.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:51.810
So Christ by desire, they may want
to Murray and then therefore receive

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:54.300
condemnation because they have
renounced their original pledge.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:55.260
And again, that's that.

00:29:56.325 --> 00:29:59.205
To be a part of helping the
church in their agreement

00:29:59.205 --> 00:30:00.615
to be committed as a widow.

00:30:01.395 --> 00:30:03.705
But then he goes on to verse
13 and that's the same time.

00:30:03.705 --> 00:30:06.435
They will also learn to be
idle going from house to house.

00:30:07.095 --> 00:30:10.995
Um, they'll not only be idle, but there
there'll be gossips and busybodies

00:30:10.995 --> 00:30:12.375
saying things they shouldn't say.

00:30:13.065 --> 00:30:15.254
So here's what he's saying
to those younger women.

00:30:15.285 --> 00:30:17.385
If they were getting their
needs met, they would spend more

00:30:17.385 --> 00:30:19.695
of their time in simple acts.

00:30:20.695 --> 00:30:22.875
There's consistently, even in
the prophets that talks about

00:30:22.875 --> 00:30:23.985
idleness and you guys know.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.870
When you get idle time, which we
just learned, mothers typically don't

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:33.030
get, but when you get idle time, it's
when sin usually starts creeping in.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.760
And if you've never dealt with
that praise, God, I'm so thankful.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.570
You've never dealt with that.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.330
But then the moments where I've
had idleness sin creeps in.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.690
So Paul saying, Hey, don't
enlist these women because we

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.880
want to save them from being.

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.930
And leading to sinful acts and
he gave some examples most likely

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.610
because he'd seen that happen, right.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:54.900
Gossiping and going around and telling,
telling things they shouldn't be telling.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.760
So the goal again was not just, um, so
that they could meet needs, but also so

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.220
that they could prevent them from sin.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:07.740
So then in verse 14, he says, therefore,
I want younger women to marry, have

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.450
children manage their households and give
the adversary no opportunity to accuse.

00:31:13.655 --> 00:31:17.775
So, this is where Paul encourages women
to marry, encourages them to marry.

00:31:18.135 --> 00:31:19.215
He doesn't command them.

00:31:19.215 --> 00:31:21.254
And this is something I
want to be careful about.

00:31:21.435 --> 00:31:22.155
He doesn't command them.

00:31:22.155 --> 00:31:24.765
He encouraged them because he's
saying, Hey, that's probably a

00:31:24.765 --> 00:31:26.565
better route for you to avoid sin.

00:31:27.075 --> 00:31:31.485
Can a woman choose to not
remarry and commit herself?

00:31:31.605 --> 00:31:32.445
Absolutely.

00:31:32.895 --> 00:31:33.765
That's honorable.

00:31:34.155 --> 00:31:35.504
So, so that's not what he's saying.

00:31:35.504 --> 00:31:38.025
And I always want to be clear in that
when we're talking through some of these.

00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:43.034
But he's also speaking to wanting
to meet the needs in the church.

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:46.095
And these women most likely could have
met their own needs at their young

00:31:46.095 --> 00:31:49.304
age, by not only marrying, but some
other works that they could have done.

00:31:50.294 --> 00:31:55.335
So why is Paul again,
suggesting to get married?

00:31:55.935 --> 00:31:57.885
Verse 15, really points to this.

00:31:58.395 --> 00:32:01.695
He says verse 15 for some, have
already turned away to follow Satan

00:32:02.655 --> 00:32:03.855
women who were not getting married.

00:32:04.695 --> 00:32:07.005
We're going off and doing sinful things.

00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:09.945
And what we read, even read into
this verse a little bit more, some

00:32:09.945 --> 00:32:14.175
of them were probably getting caught
in sexual immoral things because

00:32:14.175 --> 00:32:15.885
they were drawn to these things.

00:32:16.335 --> 00:32:17.895
And so why were they
drawn to these things?

00:32:17.895 --> 00:32:21.255
Because they had more time on their hands
because they weren't getting married and

00:32:21.255 --> 00:32:22.575
that's why he's encouraging them to marry.

00:32:23.115 --> 00:32:23.985
And Paul talks a lot about that.

00:32:23.985 --> 00:32:27.045
If you can't control yourself, go
get married so that it isn't sin.

00:32:27.855 --> 00:32:31.215
And so he's actually here to
help those who are younger with.

00:32:32.295 --> 00:32:35.565
To actually there, there he's
helping and some can come across

00:32:35.565 --> 00:32:36.495
and say he doesn't care for them.

00:32:36.495 --> 00:32:40.784
He absolutely does, but he's encouraging
them to not enroll because of this.

00:32:41.355 --> 00:32:45.105
And then verse 16, he says, if
any believing woman has a widow

00:32:45.105 --> 00:32:46.545
in her family, let her help them.

00:32:46.575 --> 00:32:49.905
So he's pointing back to as families,
we need to meet these needs.

00:32:50.175 --> 00:32:53.325
He says, because let the church
not be burdened so that it

00:32:53.325 --> 00:32:55.514
can help widows ingenuine.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.240
I think through this, and I know
what we're sitting here saying,

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.740
okay, what does this mean for us?

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:02.010
One?

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.949
We need to remember it because
we're going to need it one day.

00:33:04.949 --> 00:33:06.929
But I just think this is also as a church.

00:33:06.929 --> 00:33:10.080
We can learn that we need to meet
genuine needs in our community

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.129
and in our church family.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:16.110
And we need to not get distracted by
things that maybe people who would take

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:19.649
them and waste those resources away, or
our time away should not receive them.

00:33:19.649 --> 00:33:22.139
Not because you don't love
them, you actually do.

00:33:22.139 --> 00:33:24.510
And there's a way to walk
with them alongside that.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.469
But to also.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:31.380
I would say this empower believers to
actually do what God's called them to do.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.920
And this is where we would say as
families, I started asking myself this

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.400
question, how can I look at my family?

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.130
Not just my family here now in
Ohio, but all my family back

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:44.910
home and say, is there a family
members that I can help meet needs?

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.990
You know, that I feel like that that's
a command on our lives as believers

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:50.940
to help meet our family's needs.

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:52.350
It's honorable.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:53.180
It is good.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.120
And so really that's where Paul
saying, even at the end, is he saying

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.970
women, you can help meet these needs.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.620
And it's not saying the husband's
not gonna meet these needs.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.830
What is saying is typically in
that day, the husband's working.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:11.370
So how he's helping his wife meet those
needs is he's actually helping provide

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:12.780
to do, be able to meet those needs.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.200
Right.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:16.710
So as we kind of finish up today
here, here's what I would say.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.680
What is our take home was.

00:34:21.014 --> 00:34:26.295
I would say this just in that first
section, we shouldn't play favorites or

00:34:26.295 --> 00:34:29.745
treat people different because of their
age, whether you're younger or not.

00:34:29.745 --> 00:34:30.014
Right.

00:34:30.045 --> 00:34:34.034
We should treat family, uh,
with respect, love, and care.

00:34:34.545 --> 00:34:34.784
Right?

00:34:34.784 --> 00:34:39.045
Number two, we see here is that
we should take care of widows who

00:34:39.045 --> 00:34:40.755
have a legitimate need, right.

00:34:40.965 --> 00:34:44.534
Ones who don't have believing relatives,
who can do it once who have served the

00:34:44.534 --> 00:34:46.065
Lord and are committed to the Lord, right?

00:34:46.065 --> 00:34:47.115
Their character backs that up.

00:34:48.935 --> 00:34:53.885
But what do we know, or what do we do now
that our church doesn't have widows yet?

00:34:54.635 --> 00:34:57.965
This is my challenge for you is,
is even for me, is what do we do

00:34:57.965 --> 00:35:00.965
if we're walking through this text
and again, you're going, I don't

00:35:00.965 --> 00:35:02.345
feel like I have a take-home today.

00:35:03.365 --> 00:35:07.265
I think we would say we now know
we're accountable as a church on how

00:35:07.265 --> 00:35:08.765
to take care of widows in our church.

00:35:09.095 --> 00:35:11.765
I would also challenge us in this, and
this is why I want to bring this verse.

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:17.100
And James 1 27, it says pure and
undefiled religion before God.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:21.660
The father is this to look after orphans
and widows in their distress and to

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.850
keep oneself unstained from the world.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:28.620
I believe that as a church that we
can take a day like today, and we can

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:32.490
remember that we have a responsibility,
not only for widows, but for orphans,

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.040
for those who have needs in our church.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:41.340
That should be a reminder to us
to see people in need and meet.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.700
Because if it's genuine,
then we need to do it.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.640
We're called you that as a church,
as an individual, that may be

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.779
something that you're being called to.

00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:50.759
And so we're going to have an
invitation here in just a minute.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:53.640
And during this invitation, I always
give you guys something to consider,

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.610
and this is an opportunity to take
what you've heard today and say, okay,

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:57.930
Lord, what are you speaking to me?

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:00.570
And again, this may be one
that you're sitting here going,

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.860
what does this mean for me?

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:06.810
And I really want to challenge you to,
to personalize this as an individual, and

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:09.600
then look as a church, what we're doing.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.350
So the number one.

00:36:11.115 --> 00:36:14.774
I think during this time of invitation, we
need to seek the Lord in our lives, right?

00:36:15.015 --> 00:36:20.085
To see if there's any widows or
families members in need that you can

00:36:20.085 --> 00:36:22.274
help meet that need the genuine need.

00:36:22.634 --> 00:36:25.964
If you're wondering Ben, how do
I know if it's a genuine need?

00:36:26.355 --> 00:36:28.904
You know what the Lord's promise
and James one five, if you'll

00:36:28.904 --> 00:36:30.524
ask for wisdom, he will give it.

00:36:31.035 --> 00:36:35.055
So you seek the Lord, you seek the
Lord for peace to meet that need.

00:36:36.045 --> 00:36:38.774
And then if you say, Hey, this
person doesn't have a genuine.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.280
But they seem to be the
one that's always needy.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:46.140
Maybe God's calling you to come alongside
them and say, Hey, we want to help.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.970
But here's our concern is that
maybe you're not putting your

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.080
full effort to be able to help.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:55.440
And so we want to come alongside
you and help by also one showing

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.230
you who Jesus is and caring and
long walk working alongside you.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.230
But we can obviously see how
the Lord leads us to meet.

00:37:02.085 --> 00:37:06.795
Number two as a church, we can be ready
in the future to meet widow's needs.

00:37:07.095 --> 00:37:11.295
And I would even say challenge ourselves
to look not only in the needs of our

00:37:11.295 --> 00:37:16.125
church, but also the needs of our
community alongside other churches, to

00:37:16.125 --> 00:37:21.135
be able to meet their needs as a church,
we need to be wise in our generosity, but

00:37:21.135 --> 00:37:25.275
we need to be generous with our resources
because that's why we've been given them.

00:37:26.025 --> 00:37:27.645
And then the last one is
what I would challenge you

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:30.465
to as asked the Lord to help.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.050
Us as a church, conduct ourselves
in a way that represents

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:35.610
Christ to the world around us.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:38.550
This is the whole theme that
we've been talking about.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:39.690
How do we conduct ourselves?

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:45.540
Not to justify ourselves before the Lord,
but to say, Hey, I want to make sure that

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.930
I'm not being one living one way insane.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.450
The other, I also want to
model to those around me.

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:55.950
And so maybe to you today, you
need to, to reflect and say,

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:57.180
do I need to get my life back?

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:01.830
In line with the word of God to reflect
Christ the way he's called me to reflect.

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:05.370
And if so, take some time to
ask God to forgive you, give you

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.020
that heart to surrender to him.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:11.580
But here here's the last thing that I
want to say on a day like today, you

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:16.800
could say, man, is this really pointing
anybody to their need for Jesus?

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.420
100%?

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:19.050
Yes.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.930
I believe that even in a room this
size, you may wonder, oh, everybody in

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:26.220
here has to, I've already given them.

00:38:27.255 --> 00:38:31.335
Absolutely not there's people in this
room that may be wrestling with, Hey,

00:38:31.335 --> 00:38:32.895
have I truly given my life to Christ?

00:38:33.465 --> 00:38:34.815
Do I even know who Jesus is?

00:38:34.815 --> 00:38:38.745
Like, I've been trying to do
everything right, but I've been

00:38:38.745 --> 00:38:40.245
trying to do that out of my flesh.

00:38:40.275 --> 00:38:43.635
Not really out of God, living inside
of me and guiding me, maybe that's you.

00:38:43.635 --> 00:38:48.135
And if that's you, my encouragement
today is to not let another day go by.

00:38:48.825 --> 00:38:51.705
We, we believe every one of us believe
we're going to wake up tomorrow.

00:38:51.885 --> 00:38:52.215
There's no.

00:38:53.475 --> 00:38:57.075
Why not choose today as your
day to give your life to Christ?

00:38:57.615 --> 00:39:01.125
To, to what I would say is to begin
to explore what it means to know him

00:39:01.125 --> 00:39:05.065
personally and begin to live for him.

00:39:06.024 --> 00:39:09.924
And also what I would say this to
begin to apply his love and his mercy

00:39:09.924 --> 00:39:11.125
and grace to your life every day.

00:39:11.815 --> 00:39:15.024
If you haven't done that, you're
missing the greatest thing.

00:39:15.024 --> 00:39:19.615
If you're only coming every week and
hearing messages that tell you how to

00:39:19.615 --> 00:39:21.055
be a better person, you're missing the.

00:39:22.065 --> 00:39:26.234
We're wanting to point you to
Jesus who changes our life.

00:39:26.504 --> 00:39:30.645
And when he changes our life, it's not so
that we just do all these things, right.

00:39:30.645 --> 00:39:33.194
It's really for us to just know Jesus.

00:39:33.555 --> 00:39:35.984
And then as we know him, we
reflect that to the world.

00:39:36.194 --> 00:39:38.265
And when we see life
change, we celebrate it.

00:39:39.285 --> 00:39:43.125
I've seen so many people in our
church life's changed because

00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:43.754
they've given their lives to.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.380
And I would challenge
you to choose that today.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.420
If you haven't given your life
to Christ, you may be asked

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:50.440
this question, how do I do it?

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.970
How do I give my life to Christ?

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.470
It's not a formula.

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:55.840
It's not these like nine words.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.250
I say, it's an attitude of heart.

00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.820
It's literally asking the Lord to
forgive you of your sins, recognizing

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:04.330
your need for God in your life,
inviting him into your life.

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:08.890
And beginning to walk in faith with him
every day in a relationship with him.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:10.240
So it's that simple.

00:40:11.785 --> 00:40:13.375
But I would say this don't do it alone.

00:40:13.645 --> 00:40:16.195
So this is why during invitation
here in a moment, Broxton to

00:40:16.195 --> 00:40:18.295
come up, I'm going to pray.

00:40:18.355 --> 00:40:20.575
And I sit in the back and I seen
the bag every week and I think

00:40:20.575 --> 00:40:21.855
I've had one person come to me.

00:40:21.865 --> 00:40:23.275
I don't over the last year,
so maybe I need to start

00:40:23.275 --> 00:40:24.325
staying in somewhere different.

00:40:24.745 --> 00:40:27.295
I usually find people come to me
after service and that's fine.

00:40:27.295 --> 00:40:30.505
I find some of you will talk to
me in, in my home and that's fine.

00:40:31.515 --> 00:40:32.265
Whatever you do.

00:40:32.265 --> 00:40:36.705
Don't leave today before you deal with
salvation for you deal with whether

00:40:36.705 --> 00:40:37.845
you've given your life to Christ.

00:40:38.025 --> 00:40:42.585
Come talk to me back here during an
invitation, come talk to me after service,

00:40:42.795 --> 00:40:45.555
whatever it is, please don't leave today.

00:40:45.555 --> 00:40:47.745
Before you give your life to Christ.

00:40:47.745 --> 00:40:50.055
You're asked questions about what it
means to give your life to Christ,

00:40:50.805 --> 00:40:54.855
but if that's not you today, I still
ask during this time of invitation

00:40:55.154 --> 00:40:56.174
to consider what the Lord spoke.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:03.000
Say yes to Jesus, repent of sins and leave
out of here, living your life for Christ

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.250
so that the world can know who he is.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.180
So I'm going to pray for us and then
we'll have a time of invitation.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.340
So Lord Jesus, we thank you for today.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:15.300
Lord, we thank you for this text to
guide and direct us as a church Lord,

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.890
because Lord, we need your wisdom
on how to conduct ourselves Lord.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.290
In today, you specifically
talk to us about how.

00:41:23.085 --> 00:41:26.895
Um, treat those Lord that are
older or younger than us Lord and

00:41:26.895 --> 00:41:28.904
how we should not neglect them.

00:41:29.685 --> 00:41:32.235
Lord, how each one of them plays
an important role in our lives.

00:41:32.805 --> 00:41:37.335
Lord, we were reminded today of the
importance of ministering to the

00:41:37.335 --> 00:41:42.795
needs of widows Lord in our church
and Lord, when that time comes that we

00:41:42.795 --> 00:41:43.964
have the ability to meet those needs.

00:41:43.964 --> 00:41:48.165
Lord, I pray that we do it in such a God
honoring way that we are ready for it.

00:41:48.694 --> 00:41:52.145
Lord, I even challenged each one of us
as individuals and add collectively as.

00:41:53.055 --> 00:41:54.375
That we seek you today.

00:41:54.885 --> 00:41:57.015
And we say, Lord, how can we be better?

00:41:57.495 --> 00:42:00.585
And meeting the needs in our church
and even meeting the needs in our

00:42:00.585 --> 00:42:04.845
community with the resources that you've
given us or to meet the needs of our

00:42:04.845 --> 00:42:08.745
community to help lives be changed
so that they can know who you are.

00:42:09.315 --> 00:42:12.225
So Lord, give us the wisdom for that Lord.

00:42:12.225 --> 00:42:14.355
Also, I just pray for
the person in this room.

00:42:14.355 --> 00:42:18.075
Lord, the person in this room that's
considering giving their lives to you.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.320
Maybe afraid to, to admit their need
for you, Lord, I pray that today they

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.490
have the boldness to say yes to you,
Lord, that they do come back and talk

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:29.880
to me if it's after service or during
invitation Lord that they come and ask,

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.170
Hey, how do I get my life to Jesus?

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:34.710
Or, or they come tell me that they gave
their lives to Jesus or give them the

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:38.700
boldness to do that because that's why
we're here for more and more people to

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:43.950
know you and more and more people to begin
to live a life that experiences your love,

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:45.510
grace and mercy every day and show them.

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.919
So Lord, we love you and we praise you
and we pray this in your holy name.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:50.790
Amen.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:51.299
Amen.
