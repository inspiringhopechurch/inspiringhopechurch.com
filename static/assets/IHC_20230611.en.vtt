00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.300
You know what I mean?

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.790
Um, see, somebody got it.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.300
Somebody got it.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.800
I was waiting for the
one person to get it.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.430
Uh, first question, I wanna make
sure, did everybody get one of these?

00:00:11.435 --> 00:00:12.240
Anybody need one?

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.530
It's, uh, sermon notes.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.100
Wanna make sure?

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.330
I think we caught most people.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.130
I wanna make sure you need one.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.970
There's more up here.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.990
Okay.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.360
All right.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.940
So we are on the last.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.580
Week of our series, we have been talking
about Shalom, shalom, and shalom.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.919
Shalom is finding God's perfect peace.

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.420
So when you put those two words together,
it's peace, but it's peace on top of

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.010
peace, which is God's perfect peace.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.839
And so it's finding God's perfect peace.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.620
In the midst of our mental struggles.

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:48.390
Um, what we find is as we've been talking
through this series, we've had all

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.120
these different subjects we've talked
about that we struggle with mentally.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.800
And so it's anxiety and depression and
worry and, uh, negative thinking and.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.100
Trauma.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.780
And today we get to talk about burnout.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.360
And all these things are typically
topics or subjects that are difficult

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.200
to talk about in the church.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.390
And the reason why, and I'll just
give you this great example, if

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.910
you've ever been around them, maybe
you're this person, you, and maybe

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.840
you think this way, I don't know.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.870
Um, but when we begin to talk about
mental struggles, if you start to share

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.950
that I have anxiety, the first thing that
you'll typically hear from a Christian is.

00:01:19.065 --> 00:01:20.025
We shouldn't have anxiety.

00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:20.804
We're Christians.

00:01:20.804 --> 00:01:21.975
We have the spirit of God inside of us.

00:01:21.975 --> 00:01:24.795
And again, the Bible says that we
shouldn't have anxiety, we shouldn't

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:27.765
be anxious for nothing, but in all
things through prayer and supplication,

00:01:27.765 --> 00:01:31.935
like so we understand the word
of God, but what happens when we

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:33.345
know we shouldn't have anxiety?

00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:36.735
The Bible and God says, don't
have anxiety, but we have anxiety.

00:01:37.455 --> 00:01:42.285
In the Christian world, typically if you
have anxiety and you know those things.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.580
There must be something wrong with you.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.870
You have some unrepentant sin, you
know, you just need to give it to God.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.979
You just need to give it to God.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.520
And we can say that about
depression and worry, and we can

00:01:53.524 --> 00:01:54.420
say that about all these things.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.720
And the truth is, and again,
so you know, as a pastor, 100%,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.289
everything that we struggle with
mentally, we should give it to God.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.910
Everything we struggle with
mentally, God understands and

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.500
wants us not to struggle with that.

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:11.325
But what happens when we still struggle
with it, even though we don't know?

00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:14.865
And so that's why we've been talking about
this because I believe this is the place

00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:15.705
that we should talk about these things.

00:02:15.705 --> 00:02:19.125
If the church is not the place, we
can talk about our mental struggles.

00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:20.565
I don't know where it is, guys.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.380
I don't know where it is.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.640
And so why I, I answered this question
and the reason why I'm kind of rehashing

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.640
this is cuz we're at the end of our
series is why did we start this series?

00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:34.080
And I tell people I believe that
it was because of coming out of my

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.950
mental struggles as a pastor and as
a Christian, as just a person, that I

00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:40.200
just felt like I can't be the only one
that's struggling with these things.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.020
And so, uh, I'm gonna either talk
about it and you guys are gonna

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.700
minister to me while I'm preaching or.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.990
We all find that we all
struggle with these in some way.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.640
And I found over time that all of us
have struggled in some ways, right?

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.579
And so I think this has been
encouraging for us, hopefully,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.630
that we can seek God's word, uh,
and find some healing through it.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.130
And so if you're wondering, hey, what.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.320
What did you preach on in the past?

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.430
I wasn't here for every week.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.600
You can go to our website, inspiring
hope church.com/uh, watch, I

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.350
believe is what it is, and you
will find all of our past sermons.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.310
Um, and so you guys know, uh, this
sermon series is based off a series

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.970
that I had learned and listened
to from a pastor in Oklahoma.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.270
And that church really helped me
be able to take everything that I'm

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.030
preaching today and bring to you
through God's word, bring it into

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.440
our context and our circumstances.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.380
And so I'm thankful for them in walking
through this because there's a lot

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.670
of professionals that they consulted.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.720
You're gonna hear me mention some
words today that I wouldn't have

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.620
been able to figure out on my own.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.320
So I hope that, again,
I'm thankful for them.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.420
I'm hopeful this has been
encouraging to you guys.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.030
So I really just wanna
start with this question.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.290
Uh, have you ever came to a
point in your life where you felt

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.030
like you were always on edge?

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.690
Um, maybe where you feel like
you couldn't take any more?

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.210
Maybe if you were like
me, maybe you hit a wall.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.190
Life became too much.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.830
Um, maybe you just felt the pressures of
life mounting to a point where you just

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.680
feel like you're going to crumble anybody.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.480
Okay.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.600
Um, I think a lot of us has
probably come to that point.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.740
And the thing that I want you to
know today is you are not alone.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.769
I think that's something that
all of us need to take home.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.800
We have an enemy that is
gonna consistently try to

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.600
tell us that we are alone.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.250
And so you are not alone.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.520
Um, and so what we find is there's a lot
of people in this church, there's a lot of

00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:30.090
people in our community that are dealing
with these same things, but they're

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.550
afraid to admit that they're struggling
with these things for fear of judgment,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.660
for fear of thinking that they're weak,
they're not strong enough, and especially

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.000
in the Christian world, because Christians
should have it all figured out, right?

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.245
I mean, We should be.

00:04:43.245 --> 00:04:45.825
I'm telling you, just as a pastor
and maybe as a Christian for you,

00:04:45.825 --> 00:04:49.095
you start wondering, I'm supposed
to have this all together, right?

00:04:50.325 --> 00:04:51.255
I don't think that's true.

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:53.505
We're a broken people.

00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:55.695
Just like anybody that doesn't know
Jesus or knows Jesus, we just have a

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.675
hope and the one that isn't broken, he
was broken for us, but he's now knew.

00:05:01.755 --> 00:05:03.555
That's the one we seek in
the midst of our brokenness.

00:05:03.555 --> 00:05:05.925
So this is a place where we can
be real and we can be broken.

00:05:06.315 --> 00:05:09.135
And just so you can even know this,
again, this is statistics, but 2021,

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.224
they did a survey with workers and
they asked this question for those

00:05:12.224 --> 00:05:16.275
who are working, how many of you
feel burned out with your jobs?

00:05:16.275 --> 00:05:18.735
And over 50% of the people said at
that point they were burned out.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.844
Now that is, just think about this.

00:05:20.055 --> 00:05:23.685
That is only work that
they were burned out with.

00:05:24.135 --> 00:05:26.805
Now let's add in home life.

00:05:27.405 --> 00:05:32.025
Personal life, personal struggles, and
that burnout rate is a little bit higher.

00:05:32.325 --> 00:05:33.885
Again, those are the people
that are answering surveys,

00:05:33.885 --> 00:05:35.085
people that are gonna be honest.

00:05:35.385 --> 00:05:37.875
And so again, for us, we understand that.

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:41.655
We understand that the combination
of all these things has led to,

00:05:41.745 --> 00:05:43.335
to burnout in many of our lives.

00:05:43.605 --> 00:05:46.485
Um, and I just wanna kinda
describe what one counselor says.

00:05:46.485 --> 00:05:48.285
Burnout is, he describes it this way.

00:05:48.285 --> 00:05:53.625
It's a reflection of our inability
to balance all the competing demands.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.469
We struggle with, I'm
gonna say this again.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.200
Burnout is a reflection of all of
our inability to balance all the

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.880
competing demands that we struggle with.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.060
So lemme just give you some of those
competing demands that we have.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.380
We have the social pressures that
we face, that we feel like, that

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.400
we have to be there for everyone.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.380
If you're anything like me, we feel like
we have to be there for our family and

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.729
be there for our, our, our jobs and, and
for our extended friends and everything.

00:06:18.675 --> 00:06:21.615
We wanna live up to not only the
expectations that we have on ourselves,

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:24.765
but the expectations that we believe
other people have as, as a parent or as a

00:06:24.915 --> 00:06:27.735
child, or as a coworker, or as a friend.

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:32.025
We tend to wanna be available
or we are available 24 7.

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:34.335
And if you're on social media,
you feel like you're always

00:06:34.935 --> 00:06:37.845
hooked up and, and available and
talking and sharing your stories.

00:06:37.845 --> 00:06:42.285
And we wanna come through as though
we're positive and we wanna be able to

00:06:42.285 --> 00:06:45.765
serve, and we wanna be able to give, and
then just add in the financial pressures

00:06:45.765 --> 00:06:46.665
that we're living in in this world.

00:06:46.665 --> 00:06:46.965
Right.

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.490
We have all those pressures of
needing to meet bills and, and

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.990
pay all these things for kids.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.460
And if you know, I'm just
not talking about kids.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.580
If you don't have kids right now
taking just care of life in general,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.780
um, then you just add that to, for
me, I would just put this one in.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.599
Those who do have kids, all the
kids activities every now of

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:05.940
the week on top of everything.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.520
Then there's the one that
we don't talk about much.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.360
It's the spiritual guilt.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.230
See, we have all these other things
that are competing for all of our life.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.210
And then this is spiritual guilt because
what happens is God should be first

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.910
in our lives, and we know that those
of us who maybe have given our life,

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.120
Christ, if you don't know that, that's
fine, but we typically know that, but

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.630
it becomes 10th on the list and we
only make it to number five every day.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.890
You, you hear what I'm saying?

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.670
Like the spiritual guilt is, but it should
be number one, but I never get to it.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.570
I never get to it, and I feel so
bad and I'm feel so guilty, and I'm

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.160
not living up to God's expectation.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.860
Then it just sets in, right?

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:48.120
I think many of us probably feel this
way at times, and we find that now that

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.220
we know that over, you know, 50% of
people associate with those same things.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.210
Here's what I find.

00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:55.230
Misery loves company.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.480
I think it's good to know we are not the
only ones, and now what I mean by we, it's

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.520
the person that you're looking at in the
mirror because sometimes you believe, why

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.100
am I just not able to handle this load?

00:08:08.445 --> 00:08:12.405
Why, and that's what
the enemy likes to do.

00:08:12.405 --> 00:08:16.034
So we're gonna talk about today
that we have a way to overcome it.

00:08:16.034 --> 00:08:17.115
Why do we do this?

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:20.294
And, um, how we can continue
to, to move forward.

00:08:20.294 --> 00:08:22.515
And so I wanna pray for us, and
then we're gonna kind of dive in

00:08:22.515 --> 00:08:23.625
and kind of break this thing down.

00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:24.224
So let's pray.

00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:28.844
So Lord Jesus, because we know your
Lord and we're submitting to you and

00:08:28.844 --> 00:08:32.204
what you want to teach today and how you
want to move in our lives, Lord, today

00:08:32.294 --> 00:08:36.885
I'm praying for all the distractions
in our lives, Lord, to just go away.

00:08:37.245 --> 00:08:42.375
I'm praying, Lord, for the hearts of those
who have come in burdened and maybe on the

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:46.575
brink of burnout or dealing with stress,
or maybe they're in the midst of burnout.

00:08:46.575 --> 00:08:48.825
Lord, I'm praying that today
they will hear your voice

00:08:48.825 --> 00:08:50.175
and they will find freedom.

00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:51.345
They'll find peace.

00:08:51.555 --> 00:08:52.785
They'll find shalom.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:53.205
Shalom.

00:08:53.775 --> 00:08:57.105
Lord, I'm praying that you move
in a mighty way because only

00:08:57.105 --> 00:08:59.595
you can, and so Lord, we just
pray this in your heaven name.

00:08:59.925 --> 00:09:00.215
Amen.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.410
So I wanna talk a little bit about
stress, and I wanna talk about burnout

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.620
because they're two different things,
but stress leads to burnout, right?

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.680
And so we wanna kind of break those
down and see the differences because

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.630
every one of us has stress in our lives.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.490
So the first thing we
wanna talk about is stress.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.790
So stress is generally short lived.

00:09:18.245 --> 00:09:18.485
Right.

00:09:18.485 --> 00:09:20.405
It's related to a
temporary project or event.

00:09:20.405 --> 00:09:22.895
So I wanna kind of give you
this idea of, think of a work

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.485
project that is due next week.

00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:27.305
You're stressed about getting that done,
but there's an accomplishment point at the

00:09:27.305 --> 00:09:28.895
end of seven days, you'll have that done.

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:32.735
There's stressed about a new job
or a broken down card that's gonna

00:09:32.735 --> 00:09:33.995
get fixed in a couple of weeks.

00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:36.635
And so those things are stress.

00:09:37.199 --> 00:09:39.510
Typically there's an ending
point, so we would call those.

00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:42.089
Is there, the end of it is in in sight.

00:09:42.089 --> 00:09:47.819
It's a short term, but burnout
is chronic stress that never

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.140
feels like it will ever end.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:54.480
It persists for a long time over
and over and over again, where we

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.250
begin to look at the stress in our
life and we see no end in sight.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.410
We may feel at those points that there's
just like nothing else you can give yet.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.570
The world, those around you expect you
to wake up tomorrow and to do it all over

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.550
again to try to meet those expectations.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.670
So this is where we find ourselves
dealing with burnout, right?

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:18.720
And if you find yourself dealing
with that, I always say, good news.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.180
The Bible addresses this and
how the Bible addresses this.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.480
Sometimes it doesn't specifically say,
Hey, burnout, but what it says is, here's

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.230
somebody in the Bible who's walked through
a difficult, stressful season in their

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.960
life and this is where they went wrong.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.090
And this is where God showed up.

00:10:33.885 --> 00:10:35.445
So the good news, we get to do that today.

00:10:35.595 --> 00:10:37.995
Uh, and if you were here with us
about six, seven weeks ago, we

00:10:37.995 --> 00:10:40.695
actually started a little bit with
this story, with the story of Elijah.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.060
And so, um, we're gonna be,
um, in, oh gosh, I'm gonna

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.100
look First Kings Chapter 19.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.170
So if you wanna turn there
first, Kings Chapter 19.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.140
I'm gonna give you some background
on Elijah and a little bit

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.760
about what he has been doing.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.450
So again, first Kings chapter 19
verses we'll be up behind us as well

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:58.620
if you don't have a Bible with you.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.720
Um, but Elijah, we, again, we've discussed
this story, but when we think about this

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:09.090
background of Elijah, and we talked about
this a couple weeks ago, Elijah was a man.

00:11:09.525 --> 00:11:13.905
Following God, and he was used
by God in some mighty ways.

00:11:13.905 --> 00:11:17.295
Yet when we begin to look at his
story, he dealt with anxiety.

00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:22.814
He dealt with depression, he dealt with
exhaustion, and he dealt with burnout.

00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:25.995
And when we begin to look at Elijahs
story and we think about all that

00:11:25.995 --> 00:11:28.064
God did through him, I'm just gonna
kinda walk through some of this.

00:11:28.064 --> 00:11:30.855
Number one, he was a prophet
of God, so God spoke to him.

00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:34.335
And there was a time where he addressed
a king and he says, you know what?

00:11:34.395 --> 00:11:37.215
This is the people of Israel,
God's people of the time.

00:11:37.215 --> 00:11:38.235
And he says, you know what?

00:11:38.415 --> 00:11:41.175
Your people have continued to send you,
continue to leave your people to send.

00:11:41.175 --> 00:11:43.215
And so there's going to
be a drought in the land.

00:11:44.085 --> 00:11:45.375
And so what did Ahab wanna do?

00:11:45.375 --> 00:11:46.725
The king, he wanted to kill him.

00:11:46.725 --> 00:11:47.805
And so what did Elijah have to do?

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.825
He had to run and hide.

00:11:49.425 --> 00:11:51.735
And as he was running and
hiding, and as this drought was

00:11:51.735 --> 00:11:53.985
coming on, God provided water.

00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:57.705
But God not only provided
water, he provided food.

00:11:58.545 --> 00:11:59.835
You know how God provided food?

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.980
By Ravens dropping food down.

00:12:02.295 --> 00:12:03.045
Where he was at.

00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:03.705
Crazy.

00:12:03.705 --> 00:12:04.035
Right?

00:12:04.035 --> 00:12:04.425
Crazy.

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:07.095
So God was providing for this guy.

00:12:07.455 --> 00:12:11.295
Then at the end of this drought, God
decides to bring all these prophets of

00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:15.435
Bell, which is the prophets that the King
of Ahab was following, which was wrong,

00:12:15.765 --> 00:12:17.775
and he brought them all together and King.

00:12:18.245 --> 00:12:20.285
Ahab said, okay then what are we gonna do?

00:12:20.285 --> 00:12:21.214
How are we gonna fix this?

00:12:21.214 --> 00:12:22.954
And so Elijah says, you know what?

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:27.185
Have the, the prophets of Bell begin
to call out to their God and we're

00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:28.925
gonna have this offering out there.

00:12:28.925 --> 00:12:30.875
And if your God will come down
and consume that offering,

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.765
then that God bell is the God.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:37.324
But if I pray and I call on our God
the one true God, and if he comes

00:12:37.324 --> 00:12:40.084
down and consumes this offering,
then he is the one true God.

00:12:40.084 --> 00:12:42.875
And so, as we all know, if you've ever
read the story, it's all in there.

00:12:42.875 --> 00:12:43.865
Just go and read it.

00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:45.785
But basically we figured this out.

00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:47.615
Is that the one true God?

00:12:48.194 --> 00:12:50.385
Comes down and consumes
the fire when Elijah prays.

00:12:50.925 --> 00:12:56.505
And so Elijah was part of helping all
these prophets, uh, basically be murdered

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.755
because they were false prophets.

00:12:59.084 --> 00:13:01.485
And that sounds really bad,
but they were horrible people.

00:13:01.935 --> 00:13:05.505
So right after then, Elijah
begins to pray and the drought.

00:13:05.955 --> 00:13:07.095
Is now gone.

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:08.564
Rain begins to pour.

00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:12.375
And the next thing that we see here in
this text, and I wanna read this here,

00:13:12.675 --> 00:13:16.455
uh, just the first couple of verses it
says, Ahab, which is the King of Israel

00:13:16.455 --> 00:13:20.295
at this time, is basically saying this,
he says he told Jezebel, which is his

00:13:20.295 --> 00:13:23.925
wife, the Queen, everything that Elijah
had done, which Elijah had pretty

00:13:23.925 --> 00:13:25.395
much ruffled some feathers, right?

00:13:25.785 --> 00:13:28.064
And how he had killed all
the prophets with the sword.

00:13:28.485 --> 00:13:33.405
And so Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah
and said, may the Gods punish me and do

00:13:33.405 --> 00:13:39.465
so severely if I don't make your life like
the one of them by this time tomorrow.

00:13:40.245 --> 00:13:41.355
So here's what we see.

00:13:41.655 --> 00:13:45.045
Elijah, a prophet of God
that has been used mightily.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.055
God has showed up provided for him.

00:13:47.295 --> 00:13:50.175
Yes, there's been a lot of stressful
situations, but Elijah has showed up.

00:13:50.805 --> 00:13:52.365
That's how all Christians
should be, right?

00:13:52.365 --> 00:13:55.814
We should just be strong and courageous
and just do these a mighty things.

00:13:55.814 --> 00:13:57.555
And you know, I think through
the spirit of God, that's

00:13:57.555 --> 00:13:58.935
exactly what Elijah was doing.

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:01.574
But there came a point, and
here's the funny part guys.

00:14:01.755 --> 00:14:04.545
All it took was one woman and he was done.

00:14:05.535 --> 00:14:06.915
So women, you're very powerful.

00:14:07.485 --> 00:14:07.785
Okay.

00:14:08.535 --> 00:14:10.395
And nobody else said amen other than you.

00:14:10.395 --> 00:14:10.635
Okay.

00:14:10.665 --> 00:14:11.295
Thank you brother.

00:14:11.564 --> 00:14:11.835
Okay.

00:14:12.405 --> 00:14:17.595
Um, and so what we see here is it
wasn't this one threat by Jezebel.

00:14:17.715 --> 00:14:18.885
Here's what we know.

00:14:19.365 --> 00:14:25.935
Burnout is all of them compounding
at the same time repetitively.

00:14:26.445 --> 00:14:29.685
So this is just the one that
kind of pushed him over the edge.

00:14:29.895 --> 00:14:32.115
And this is where we kind of
pick up to this story where

00:14:32.295 --> 00:14:34.185
he basically began to crumble.

00:14:35.235 --> 00:14:36.705
You guys know what it's like to crumble?

00:14:36.705 --> 00:14:37.455
I'm gonna read more of the story.

00:14:37.455 --> 00:14:38.895
You guys know what it's
like to crumble, right?

00:14:38.955 --> 00:14:41.685
When we think about life, I'm just gonna
kinda give you a scenario here, right?

00:14:42.105 --> 00:14:45.285
We're dealing with stress at work,
and this is what you say to yourself.

00:14:45.585 --> 00:14:47.295
I'm okay, it's fine.

00:14:48.105 --> 00:14:51.135
But the problem is, at the end of
your workday, you got a call from the

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.415
principal that your child got in trouble.

00:14:53.445 --> 00:14:56.395
You get there and you're told by the
principal at how poor of a parent you is,

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:58.485
and you are, and how bad your child is.

00:14:58.905 --> 00:14:59.505
It's okay.

00:15:00.255 --> 00:15:00.795
I'm fine.

00:15:01.215 --> 00:15:02.235
On the way home.

00:15:02.295 --> 00:15:03.375
Your car breaks down.

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:07.560
And you can't get home and you have
to call a friend to get you home.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:08.430
It's okay.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.360
I think I'm okay.

00:15:09.719 --> 00:15:10.290
It's fine.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.620
Then you go to the doctor a week
later and you find that you need

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.790
more testing, and then you begin
to realize maybe I'm not okay.

00:15:18.329 --> 00:15:21.150
And the thing that we realize is that all
these things that come into your life and

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.979
your story may be a little bit different.

00:15:23.295 --> 00:15:23.595
Right.

00:15:23.775 --> 00:15:26.655
You think of all the things that begin
to compound it over and over and over.

00:15:26.655 --> 00:15:30.285
The expectation to wake up and go
to work and get past that stress

00:15:30.345 --> 00:15:34.455
and to raise your kids right, and
to fix the car, and to go figure out

00:15:34.455 --> 00:15:35.895
your own personal medical issues.

00:15:36.045 --> 00:15:38.325
And the list goes on and on and on.

00:15:38.325 --> 00:15:40.365
And again, we've, we've been there.

00:15:40.365 --> 00:15:44.505
We, we live in a society where it seems
like there's never an end in sight.

00:15:45.974 --> 00:15:49.185
We may look at what Elijah's
going through here and all that.

00:15:49.185 --> 00:15:51.584
He went through and may say, well,
it's not as bad, maybe bad as him.

00:15:51.584 --> 00:15:53.744
Or maybe we feel like
ours is worse than his.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.125
And we've talked about this before.

00:15:55.305 --> 00:15:57.614
We do not compare.

00:15:58.574 --> 00:15:59.655
We wanna know why we don't compare.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.444
And we go, well, you shouldn't be that
bad because my life's worse than yours.

00:16:02.444 --> 00:16:03.765
Or, you know, vice versa.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:04.964
We wanna know why we don't compare.

00:16:05.175 --> 00:16:10.694
Because what you're going
through is real, your emotions.

00:16:11.565 --> 00:16:15.315
The burnout in which you're walking
through is real to you, and for me to

00:16:15.315 --> 00:16:18.795
judge whether my life's worse than yours
and you need to suck it up and figure this

00:16:18.795 --> 00:16:23.235
out, I'm telling you that's not my place
because God cares right where you're at.

00:16:24.105 --> 00:16:26.235
So let's look at Elijah's
story a little bit more, right?

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:29.265
So what happens after
Jezebel makes this threat?

00:16:29.265 --> 00:16:31.455
So let's say look at
verses three through five.

00:16:31.845 --> 00:16:32.355
It says this.

00:16:32.355 --> 00:16:34.455
Then Elijah becomes afraid.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.620
And immediately ran for his life.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.280
And when he came to Beersheba
that belonged to Judah,

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.780
he left his servant there.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.480
But he went on a day's journey
into the wilderness and he sat

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.840
down under the broom tree and he
play, prayed that he might die.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:55.590
And he said, I have had enough Lord take
my life from no better than my father's.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.480
So the question is, how does our
bodies respond to stress and burnout?

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.280
I wanna talk a little bit
about that before we dive

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.440
even further into this story.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:09.300
So, We see that our bodies begin to
respond in three ways, and this is again,

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.010
professionals begin to tell you this.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:15.450
Professionals will tell you what happens
to our lives and our bodies physically.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:20.100
When we're going through stress,
we end up being more fatigued.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.770
And again, you guys may even
start seeing these things in your

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:27.210
life begin more fatigued, low on
energy, finding it difficult to

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:28.590
recover from a normal day's work.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:34.200
You may look and say, six months
ago I worked 45, 50 hours a week.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:34.890
No problem.

00:17:36.045 --> 00:17:40.335
Now I can barely get through a day without
needing to take a nap when I get home.

00:17:40.455 --> 00:17:42.555
What's going on then?

00:17:43.245 --> 00:17:44.325
We can't sleep at night though.

00:17:44.325 --> 00:17:45.105
You're tired.

00:17:45.375 --> 00:17:46.335
You feel like you can't sleep.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.535
You feel like you're up all night.

00:17:47.535 --> 00:17:48.375
Your mind's running.

00:17:48.915 --> 00:17:51.375
Maybe your body begins to
ache and you have headaches.

00:17:51.375 --> 00:17:55.105
So really basically what's happening
is you're feeling the stress and your

00:17:55.295 --> 00:18:00.885
body and what happens in our society
when this happens, people start coping

00:18:01.754 --> 00:18:04.215
by choosing alcohol or choosing.

00:18:04.995 --> 00:18:06.465
Let me just tell you one of my weaknesses.

00:18:06.645 --> 00:18:10.965
Food when I'm stressed, and
then those things compound

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.005
and add to all of our burnout.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.639
We begin to struggle.

00:18:14.639 --> 00:18:16.740
So physically is one of
the ways that we respond.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.750
Number two is mentally right As we
continue experiencing stress and all

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.000
these multiple things going on, this
is where I'm gonna get a little bit

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.930
technical again, learning from some
professionals, this is what they say.

00:18:27.935 --> 00:18:30.480
Our amygdala enlarges was an amygdala.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.320
That's the almond shaped thing
in our brain that tells us

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.000
when we should respond, right?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.399
When there's trouble around,
it begins to be alarm alarm.

00:18:38.399 --> 00:18:39.300
So think about this.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:45.705
If you think you see a bear, Out in the
woods, it's triggering and saying, run.

00:18:46.365 --> 00:18:46.665
Okay?

00:18:46.844 --> 00:18:51.824
But when it enlarges, meaning, the more
and more that we stress, it's always on.

00:18:51.824 --> 00:18:53.354
Here's how I want you to think about this.

00:18:54.524 --> 00:18:58.665
What happens when you press the gas
all the way down when it's in neutral,

00:18:58.875 --> 00:19:00.165
it revs up and you hear go, eh.

00:19:01.604 --> 00:19:03.975
Eventually what happens is
gonna blow your motor up.

00:19:04.995 --> 00:19:10.274
What happens in this moment is
mentally we are a full blown.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:16.260
Wide open and at some point
it's gonna break and many of us

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.460
are riding that red line again.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.159
If you know tachometer, you know a little
bit more of this stuff, but it begins that

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:23.850
red line and we're pushing that red line
and we're holding wide open, hoping we can

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.070
make it without completely burning out.

00:19:26.385 --> 00:19:29.985
So that happens, but then it
allows fear to come in, right?

00:19:29.985 --> 00:19:33.315
We're more vulnerable to fear and it
makes us wanna run from our lives.

00:19:33.555 --> 00:19:34.665
Here's another big word.

00:19:35.055 --> 00:19:36.405
This is something else
that happens mentally.

00:19:36.405 --> 00:19:38.745
Our prefrontal cortex tends to weaken.

00:19:38.865 --> 00:19:41.745
This is the part of, of our brain
that helps us make decisions.

00:19:41.745 --> 00:19:44.085
I'm telling you I have, this
makes total sense to me.

00:19:44.925 --> 00:19:46.455
This makes it.

00:19:46.995 --> 00:19:49.185
We become less confident
in decision making.

00:19:49.455 --> 00:19:54.045
It comes to the point where we're unable
to make some of the smallest decisions.

00:19:54.105 --> 00:19:57.135
If somebody says where you wanna go eat,
I know that's one of our biggest fights

00:19:57.135 --> 00:20:02.535
in marriage, but sometimes we don't even
wanna make that because it's exhausting.

00:20:03.045 --> 00:20:04.995
We don't even wanna make the
decision what clothes we wear.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.550
It becomes exhausting for some.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.990
They even lose their memory and they
become difficult to focus, and we

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.320
become difficult to focus because
we have so many things in our minds.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.900
We can't focus on one
thing, so that's mentally.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:23.820
The last thing is emotionally, as we
continue to battle stress, we become

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.640
less motivated to do anything, right?

00:20:26.879 --> 00:20:27.960
We feel like a failure.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.580
We begin to isolate ourselves.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:33.105
We start saying, I don't like my job.

00:20:33.495 --> 00:20:35.655
I don't like my marriage,
I don't like my friends.

00:20:35.655 --> 00:20:36.675
I don't like my life.

00:20:37.335 --> 00:20:40.635
And then as a believer, we
begin to be discontinued with

00:20:40.635 --> 00:20:42.165
God and we start blaming him.

00:20:42.945 --> 00:20:46.065
So the question is, and typically
what we ask ourself, this

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.325
question is, how did we get here?

00:20:47.925 --> 00:20:48.915
How did we get here?

00:20:49.005 --> 00:20:52.875
If this is the response, if any of this
starts to resonate with some of y'all,

00:20:53.955 --> 00:20:55.845
the question is how did we get here?

00:20:56.235 --> 00:20:57.015
What happened?

00:20:57.825 --> 00:21:01.035
I've been asking that same question
for the last three years, and just

00:21:01.035 --> 00:21:04.005
so you guys know, it seems like this
at, at this point, if you've been

00:21:04.005 --> 00:21:07.485
here for all this series and you're
seeing your pastor up here talk about

00:21:07.485 --> 00:21:10.785
every week, well, pastor Ben, it
seems like you've dealt with anxiety.

00:21:11.535 --> 00:21:14.925
Have you dealt, it seems like you've
dealt with depression and, and you've

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:18.465
dealt with worry and you've dealt with,
you know, all this negative thinking

00:21:18.465 --> 00:21:20.415
and, and you've dealt with some trauma.

00:21:20.865 --> 00:21:22.335
And this week you're telling
me to deal with burnout.

00:21:22.335 --> 00:21:23.535
You're a pretty messed up pastor.

00:21:25.515 --> 00:21:30.175
I say the same thing in the mirror every
morning, and he, here's the thing, I,

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.655
I don't just claim it to try to relate.

00:21:33.195 --> 00:21:36.165
I've gone through it and, and
we talked about it last week.

00:21:36.585 --> 00:21:42.825
There's a reason why, because God
wants to use that story to allow me

00:21:42.825 --> 00:21:46.545
to be able to relate with those around
us, because I'm not the only one.

00:21:47.565 --> 00:21:48.855
So I've been asking the same question.

00:21:48.855 --> 00:21:51.075
Why the last three years?

00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:54.375
It seems like come
summertime, I'm burned out.

00:21:55.005 --> 00:21:55.965
I dunno if anybody else can relate.

00:21:55.965 --> 00:21:57.795
There may be a different
season of life for you.

00:21:58.125 --> 00:22:00.585
It's just I'm done and I'm exhausted.

00:22:01.215 --> 00:22:02.475
And I ask the same question.

00:22:02.775 --> 00:22:03.255
Why?

00:22:03.945 --> 00:22:05.595
Why do I keep doing this?

00:22:05.865 --> 00:22:09.645
And this is where we get the opportunity
to come right back to Elijah and

00:22:09.645 --> 00:22:12.765
see what led him to this point.

00:22:13.215 --> 00:22:16.245
And so this is the thing, three thing,
three mistakes that Elijah made.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.320
That many of us make
when it comes to burnout.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.470
Number one, we run
ourselves into the ground.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:28.110
So obviously Jezebel says this,
Hey, I'm gonna kill you if you

00:22:28.115 --> 00:22:29.970
basically live till tomorrow.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:30.930
Like, it's not gonna happen.

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:31.530
I'm gonna kill you.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.460
And so what does he do?

00:22:32.465 --> 00:22:36.840
He says, then Elijah became afraid
and he immediately ran for his life.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.330
We run ourselves into the ground,
and the reason why we run ourselves

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.150
into the ground is because we have
this thought in our minds that

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.560
we have to do everything right.

00:22:45.075 --> 00:22:48.435
Everything and, and something I'm trying
to encourage myself and remind myself of,

00:22:48.795 --> 00:22:55.065
if there is more on your to-do list than
you have time for, then there is something

00:22:55.065 --> 00:22:56.265
on there that God didn't put there.

00:22:57.885 --> 00:23:01.155
And when that happens, we need
to ask and evaluate, Lord,

00:23:01.815 --> 00:23:03.675
what is it that I put on there?

00:23:04.965 --> 00:23:06.495
So we run ourselves.

00:23:07.995 --> 00:23:08.925
Ragged basically.

00:23:09.105 --> 00:23:11.295
And so we look at this
where we see he ran.

00:23:11.295 --> 00:23:12.705
It says he ran all the way to be Yeshiva.

00:23:12.765 --> 00:23:18.465
And if you were to look at this on a map,
many believe this was over 100 miles.

00:23:18.525 --> 00:23:19.695
That's four marathons.

00:23:19.845 --> 00:23:21.045
We don't know how many days it took him.

00:23:21.465 --> 00:23:25.485
I'll just tell you this, I run outta
breath running into the fridge, 100 miles.

00:23:25.725 --> 00:23:29.835
He had to be exhausted, so
he ran himself to death.

00:23:31.185 --> 00:23:34.155
And it's easy to do that when we
think about all the activities

00:23:34.245 --> 00:23:35.055
that we're involved in.

00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:39.315
The while we're neglecting our
emotional, physical, and spiritual needs.

00:23:40.425 --> 00:23:43.065
Number two, we try to
do it all on our own.

00:23:43.065 --> 00:23:47.295
Let's see here where Elijah made the
next mistake he ran for his life.

00:23:48.765 --> 00:23:51.285
And then it says, when he came
to Beersheba that belonged to

00:23:51.285 --> 00:23:53.265
Judah, he left his sermon there.

00:23:54.225 --> 00:23:56.955
See, in this moment,
Elijah's like, you know what?

00:23:56.955 --> 00:23:57.915
I need to cut the fat.

00:23:58.665 --> 00:24:00.375
I need to get rid of anything
that's holding me back from

00:24:00.375 --> 00:24:01.605
continuing to run from this woman.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:07.980
What he forgot was that servant
was somebody who co-labor with him.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.200
Yeah, somebody that was a friend.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.570
Somebody that could
remove some of the burden.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.720
Somebody that on this long track of
journey that he was on and all the

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.330
stuff he was walking through that he
could just talk through things with.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.190
He left the only person that could
encourage him in this moment.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.440
So we try to do it on our own.

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.750
And so why do you hear me say almost every
Sunday you need to be in an inspire group.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.210
You don't know the
importance of inspire groups.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:37.140
It's not to give you one more thing
to do on your list that burdens you.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:41.940
I think if, if that's a burden
to you, you're missing the point.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.070
Inspire group's, not a burden.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:48.930
It's an opportunity to not
leave your friends on the side

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:49.560
and say, I don't need you.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.770
I'm just, I'm just telling you, when
you choose not to live in community,

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:54.150
you're saying, I don't need you.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:55.650
I got this.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.890
God said he created the body of Christ.

00:24:59.639 --> 00:25:02.070
I love Sunday mornings, but Sunday
mornings is not enough for me.

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.020
I don't get to hang out with y'all enough.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.760
I would love to spend time in
a room where we just hang out

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.260
and we catch up and we talk.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.459
So that's my plug.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.750
Go to an Inspire group.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:14.730
Yes.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:15.030
Thank you.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.100
See, there's one person
that's, that's all about that.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:17.820
That's just great.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.830
I need to have you around
a little more often.

00:25:20.129 --> 00:25:20.459
Okay.

00:25:21.495 --> 00:25:25.575
So we find it more difficult right when
we're alone to deal with these things.

00:25:25.635 --> 00:25:28.545
And the next thing that we'll see here
is the same thing that Elijah did is

00:25:28.545 --> 00:25:30.105
we begin to dwell on the negative.

00:25:30.105 --> 00:25:32.955
And so as Elijah goes on, it says in
verse four, he says, but he went on

00:25:32.955 --> 00:25:35.745
a day's journey into the wilderness
and he sat down under Braintree

00:25:36.045 --> 00:25:38.175
and he prayed that he might die.

00:25:38.625 --> 00:25:43.125
He said that I've had enough Lord take
my life from no better than my father's.

00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:45.225
I want you to thank for a moment.

00:25:46.755 --> 00:25:48.915
I shared some of the God stories.

00:25:50.595 --> 00:25:56.115
The things that God did in and through
this man, and yet in this moment,

00:25:56.715 --> 00:25:59.355
only thing he saw was, kill me.

00:25:59.355 --> 00:26:00.045
I'm worthless.

00:26:00.075 --> 00:26:01.125
I'm not even as good as my aunts.

00:26:01.125 --> 00:26:02.445
I'm, I'm worse than them.

00:26:03.015 --> 00:26:04.275
All he saw was the negative.

00:26:04.275 --> 00:26:09.075
Now, if you know me, that's
who I, I struggle with that.

00:26:09.315 --> 00:26:11.235
I don't know if any, does anybody
else struggle to be thing that

00:26:11.235 --> 00:26:12.135
please don't leave me out.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:12.375
Great.

00:26:12.375 --> 00:26:13.305
I got one of you, two of you.

00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:13.635
Great.

00:26:14.595 --> 00:26:14.895
Whew, man.

00:26:14.895 --> 00:26:15.875
I was starting to feel alone for a minute.

00:26:16.935 --> 00:26:20.595
We tend to dwell on the negative when we
look at all that God's done around us.

00:26:20.595 --> 00:26:21.765
And we say, oh wow.

00:26:22.125 --> 00:26:22.455
Right?

00:26:22.455 --> 00:26:26.505
So he dwells on this and to a
point of him saying, I would

00:26:26.505 --> 00:26:27.975
rather you just take my life.

00:26:28.665 --> 00:26:30.585
And I, I think this is what's crazy.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:31.665
He begins to compare his life.

00:26:31.665 --> 00:26:34.875
So see this, he says, I have had
enough Lord take my life for I

00:26:34.875 --> 00:26:36.945
am no better than my father's.

00:26:38.625 --> 00:26:44.655
Do you know where we get caught up in
the midst of our lives looking across.

00:26:45.225 --> 00:26:50.895
The way at our friends who seem to have
that great marriage, that person who seems

00:26:50.895 --> 00:26:54.945
to be successful at work and they manage
everything well, their finances are great.

00:26:55.215 --> 00:26:56.145
I mean, they're a great Christian.

00:26:56.145 --> 00:26:57.345
They read their Bible every day.

00:26:58.815 --> 00:27:01.935
Lord, I'm not as good as them, and if I'm
not as good as them, I'm not good enough.

00:27:03.315 --> 00:27:04.215
Lord, take my life.

00:27:05.025 --> 00:27:05.985
Anybody ever get to that point?

00:27:06.855 --> 00:27:09.495
And now you wanna know what's
made that easier Social media.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:15.000
The only thing you see on social media is
the great vacation and the great marriage,

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.770
and the great love note to my wife or my
spouse or my girlfriend, or you know it.

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.180
And here's the thing, we
wanna share those good things.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:21.990
Keep sharing 'em.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:25.320
But I wonder if somebody just put
on there, Hey, today really stunk.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.330
I just, man, my life's
not in a good place.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.220
Could you pray for me?

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.330
You know, people would pray.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.770
They really would.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.580
But most of us don't wanna reveal
that because it makes us vulnerable.

00:27:38.879 --> 00:27:40.020
We don't wanna seem weak.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.700
We want people to think
we got this together.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:42.659
I'm strong.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.810
But ultimately, God says
he uses weak things.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:46.110
That's right.

00:27:46.919 --> 00:27:50.340
And man, I'm reminded, I think I would
rather be weak if that's who God uses.

00:27:50.379 --> 00:27:50.669
Amen.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.629
So again, we catch ourselves
dwelling on the negative.

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:55.980
So how did we get there?

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.919
By running ourselves under the
ground, never resting, trying to do

00:27:58.919 --> 00:28:02.100
everything on our own and dwelling
on the negative in our life.

00:28:03.209 --> 00:28:06.240
But let's see, verses five and six here.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.100
So five and six it says.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.639
Then he laid down and slept
under the broom tree and suddenly

00:28:11.639 --> 00:28:14.820
an angel touched him and the
angel told him, get up and eat.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.409
And then he looked and there at
his head was a loaf of bread baked

00:28:19.415 --> 00:28:21.270
over hot stones in a jug of water.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:25.139
And so he ate and he
drank and he laid down.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:29.520
So what happened when
Elijah was burned out?

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.959
What happens?

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.150
When we're burned out, God shows up.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.610
Now you may be saying, he's
never showed up for me.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.100
He's never showed up for me.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:45.390
He's never put food next to my head
when I woke up that next morning,

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.900
and I think what ends up happening
is we're dwelling on the negative.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.880
I think we wake up with this bent
mentality that God is against us

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.920
when we need to be reminded, just
like Elijah was, that God is for us.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.810
And so he sent an angel.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.760
An angel touched him.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.880
And for some of us, we just
need a touch of God today.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:11.070
We need to be reminded that our God
loves us no matter what we're going

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:15.210
through, and he wants to minister
to us and help meet our needs.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.330
And for some of us, we're like, why
doesn't he take everything away?

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.620
And here's what God is saying.

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.790
He says, I have never promised
to take everything away, but I've

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:26.700
promised to be with you in the
midst of everything you go through.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.560
And you may say, well,
that's a horrible God.

00:29:29.429 --> 00:29:30.840
Why does he allow these things to happen?

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.510
And I say this, no matter if
you know Jesus or you don't,

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:34.710
we all go through struggles.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:40.050
But God's presence in the midst of our
struggles is a beautiful thing because it

00:29:40.054 --> 00:29:45.240
reminds us who he is and how good a God
he is and how he provides hope, and how he

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:51.120
provides peace, and how he provides us an
eternal, eternal life upon past this life.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:56.100
So there's so many things that we get,
and so God sent us angel to minister

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.510
to him in the midst of his burnout.

00:29:58.185 --> 00:29:59.775
That's God's desire for us.

00:30:00.015 --> 00:30:02.205
So here's the simple
thing that Elijah did.

00:30:02.235 --> 00:30:04.725
All he did this is all the work he did.

00:30:04.725 --> 00:30:09.705
He got up, he ate and he drank something
and he went right back to sleep.

00:30:11.055 --> 00:30:13.995
You know what that just told
me that sometimes the most

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.765
spiritual thing we can do is rest.

00:30:17.785 --> 00:30:22.665
I am a doer and I think if I'm not
doing something, I'm not doing anything.

00:30:23.865 --> 00:30:26.535
And why do you think God
created sleep at night?

00:30:26.895 --> 00:30:28.845
To remind us of our dependence upon him?

00:30:28.845 --> 00:30:32.805
Because when I am sleeping,
there's nothing I can do, nothing

00:30:32.805 --> 00:30:34.575
I can do to fix my situations.

00:30:34.754 --> 00:30:35.715
But God's not asleep.

00:30:36.345 --> 00:30:37.365
God is still working.

00:30:37.754 --> 00:30:41.385
And so in the resting,
God is still working.

00:30:42.135 --> 00:30:45.705
And so this is a reminder for
every one of us, including myself.

00:30:47.055 --> 00:30:48.405
Rest is spiritual.

00:30:48.465 --> 00:30:53.774
It's godly food and nourishment
is spiritual and it's godly,

00:30:55.185 --> 00:30:56.895
and God wants you to know that.

00:30:58.305 --> 00:31:01.335
And why do we feel
guilty when this happens?

00:31:01.335 --> 00:31:01.665
Right?

00:31:02.145 --> 00:31:03.975
Why do we feel guilty when we take rest?

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:07.155
And it's because typically the
enemy is whispering in our ears and

00:31:07.155 --> 00:31:08.175
telling us we're not good enough.

00:31:08.175 --> 00:31:08.895
We're lazy.

00:31:09.645 --> 00:31:10.695
We have enough to do.

00:31:10.695 --> 00:31:13.455
We don't have time for this,
but we have to listen to God.

00:31:13.455 --> 00:31:15.254
He created again the Sabbath.

00:31:15.555 --> 00:31:19.815
He created rest and he
reminds us that we need it.

00:31:20.325 --> 00:31:21.764
But here's something else I
wanna mention to you guys.

00:31:21.764 --> 00:31:25.095
And this may be somebody else cuz
what you may tell me, I'm still burnt

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.475
out and I'm sleeping all day long.

00:31:26.504 --> 00:31:28.034
I'm still burnt out, I'm still eating.

00:31:28.815 --> 00:31:29.445
What do I need?

00:31:29.445 --> 00:31:31.095
For some of us, we need to change a pace.

00:31:31.514 --> 00:31:32.354
A different routine.

00:31:32.774 --> 00:31:35.834
For some of you, you're really hooked
up in your job and you're working

00:31:35.864 --> 00:31:41.114
heavily and hard with your hands, and
the way that we can begin to overcome

00:31:41.264 --> 00:31:45.375
the burnout is to start working with our
hands and start working with our minds.

00:31:45.794 --> 00:31:48.614
Most professionals will tell you
that if you're burnt and you work

00:31:48.614 --> 00:31:51.824
all day long with your hands, then
you need to do something different.

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:55.540
With your mind, maybe read a book,
maybe do something that's enjoyable that

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.720
doesn't cause you to have to physically
work, but the complete opposite.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.170
For those of you that are constantly
sitting and working or constantly

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:05.230
just sitting and doing something,
maybe you need to get active and

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.540
go do something different, right?

00:32:07.545 --> 00:32:11.740
So we need to kind of change our pace
and do something in different to help

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.710
us disconnect from the stresses of life.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.100
And sometimes that's
just resting with Jesus.

00:32:19.949 --> 00:32:23.310
When it comes to burnout, one of
the things I think Elijah teaches

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:27.510
us that every one of us, no matter
where we're at in our lives, we need

00:32:27.514 --> 00:32:29.459
an encounter with God in a new way.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:34.679
And so we see this in in one Kings
chapter 19, verses 11 and 12.

00:32:34.685 --> 00:32:35.550
So let's look at this.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.500
So in verse 11, it says, then he
said, this is God speaking to Elijah.

00:32:40.679 --> 00:32:43.919
Then he says, go out and stand on
the mountain in the Lord's presence.

00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:46.110
And at the moment, the Lord passed by.

00:32:46.605 --> 00:32:49.785
And a great and mighty wind was
tearing at the mountains and was

00:32:49.785 --> 00:32:51.285
shattering the cliffs before the Lord.

00:32:51.285 --> 00:32:53.024
But the Lord was not in the wind.

00:32:53.865 --> 00:32:56.685
And after the wind there was
an earthquake, but the Lord

00:32:56.685 --> 00:32:57.764
was not in the earthquake.

00:32:57.915 --> 00:33:01.665
And after the earthquake there was a
fire, but the Lord was not in the fire.

00:33:01.965 --> 00:33:06.014
And after the fire there was
a voice and a soft whisper.

00:33:06.735 --> 00:33:08.504
We're gonna stop just right
there, and I want you to focus

00:33:08.504 --> 00:33:11.115
more in on how God speaks to us.

00:33:11.415 --> 00:33:13.845
God doesn't speak to us
in the extraordinary.

00:33:14.295 --> 00:33:15.855
He speaks to us in the ordinary.

00:33:17.085 --> 00:33:17.715
A whisper.

00:33:17.745 --> 00:33:19.815
Why does God whisper?

00:33:20.205 --> 00:33:21.495
Because he's close.

00:33:22.905 --> 00:33:24.435
God does not have to scream at you.

00:33:26.535 --> 00:33:30.225
He just has to whisper, and
that's what he's doing today.

00:33:30.465 --> 00:33:32.925
He's whispering to you today
and he's saying, I'm here.

00:33:33.465 --> 00:33:35.115
If you've dealt with burnout, I'm here.

00:33:35.115 --> 00:33:36.975
If you've dealt with anxiety, I'm here.

00:33:37.635 --> 00:33:40.965
If you've dealt with depression
or worry or negative thinking.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.270
Trauma.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.620
I am here and I'm present, and I'm
not leaving you nor forsaking you.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.840
So where was God in this moment?

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.640
He was never left Elijah.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.570
He was always there.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.180
But Elijah ran assuming
that God wasn't there.

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:59.670
So here's what he's saying is if we'll
just be still, if we'll slow down, God

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.530
will speak to us in the ordinary moments.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:06.690
If you're overwhelmed and stressed at
the edge of burnout and his voice seems

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:09.030
quiet, just know that he is close.

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:11.310
I just want you to know this.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:15.420
God's whispered drew Elijah out
of darkness and burnout, and he

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.790
can do that for you and me today.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:20.310
So if you're broken, here's what God says.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:21.540
He's close to the broken-hearted.

00:34:22.529 --> 00:34:27.150
If you feel overwhelmed, he came
to save those who are feeling

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:32.279
crushed, and if you feel hopeless,
he sent Jesus to provide hope.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.840
You know, many times
the reason why we don't.

00:34:37.635 --> 00:34:38.805
Give our lives to Jesus.

00:34:38.805 --> 00:34:41.205
We don't give our
worries over to the Lord.

00:34:41.205 --> 00:34:43.245
It's because we just don't
think he's gonna show up.

00:34:44.895 --> 00:34:46.065
And you know what I love about the Lord?

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:47.445
He says, test me in this.

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:49.155
Try me in this.

00:34:49.335 --> 00:34:50.325
I was talking to Brittany about this.

00:34:50.325 --> 00:34:53.895
I was like, I really don't know how
to describe this idea of, and it's

00:34:53.895 --> 00:34:55.125
this, you, there's, it's in verses.

00:34:55.125 --> 00:34:58.785
I don't know where it's at, but it's, he
says, taste and see that the Lord is good.

00:35:00.195 --> 00:35:03.675
And sometimes we just need to taste
and see that God will show up for

00:35:03.675 --> 00:35:05.265
you, that you will trust him here.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.840
Because when we refuse to trust him
in the areas of worry and anxiety

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.480
and all the things that we're
stressing about, what we're saying

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.490
is, God, I'm stronger than you.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.290
You're not good enough.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:17.970
And I would say this, test him.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.200
Just try it.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.430
What I, what I've found is that if
I will surrender and if I will lay

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:28.260
it before his feet, he will show
up in a mighty and amazing way.

00:35:29.145 --> 00:35:31.695
Sometimes in the most ordinary ways.

00:35:32.085 --> 00:35:34.125
So here's my hope, just
thinking of the whole series.

00:35:34.215 --> 00:35:37.185
My hope and prayer is that those of
you that been able to listen to the

00:35:37.185 --> 00:35:40.365
whole series, or maybe just today
that you've taken something from this,

00:35:40.785 --> 00:35:44.595
that God has spoken to you and given
you something practical, but also

00:35:44.595 --> 00:35:48.795
remind you that every single thing
relies on a relationship with Jesus.

00:35:48.795 --> 00:35:52.335
He is the source and the provider of
every single thing that we can give

00:35:52.335 --> 00:35:53.865
you because we talk about today, right?

00:35:54.015 --> 00:35:55.035
You need rest.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:58.630
And you need food and you need to get
your mind disconnected from these things.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.400
And if we start doing all these
tasks, cuz that's what we wanna

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.690
do, we wanna run outta here.

00:36:02.259 --> 00:36:07.720
I need to do X, Y, and Z and you're gonna
miss the first part, which is Jesus.

00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:12.700
So in this whole series, we've given
steps to take, but I pray that you don't

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.770
just go put these steps in place and
you forget God directing and guiding

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:21.460
and providing in the midst of these
steps, cuz he's the one that's created

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.009
these things to provide us help.

00:36:25.335 --> 00:36:27.705
And so for many of you, again, I
know you've struggled with a lot of

00:36:27.705 --> 00:36:30.105
things like I have, and I just pray.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.500
This has ministered to you, but I
wanna finish with reading, uh, a verse.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.580
This isn't gonna be up on our screen.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:36.780
It should be on your papers though.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.580
Matthew 1128 through 30.

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:41.610
This is from the Message Bible, and so
I wanna make sure I'm describing this.

00:36:41.615 --> 00:36:43.830
The message Bible is more
of a devotional translation.

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:47.940
It's not a literal translation, but I
love the way that it was described here.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.030
This is Jesus speaking and this
is what he says, and this is, I'm

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.150
gonna read it over you and I just
pray that it ministers to you.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.050
This is what Jesus says.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:56.280
He says, are you tired?

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.530
Are you worn out?

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.860
Are you burn out on religion?

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:03.690
He says, come to me.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.640
He says, get away with me
and you'll recover your life.

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:12.750
He says, I'll show you
how to take real rest.

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:18.150
Walk with me and work with
me and watch how I do it.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:22.080
He says, learn the
unforced rhythms of grace.

00:37:23.294 --> 00:37:26.805
He says, I won't lay anything heavy
on you, or Ill-fitting on you.

00:37:27.345 --> 00:37:32.654
Keep company with me and you'll
learn to live freely and lightly.

00:37:34.575 --> 00:37:36.674
I wanna highlight freely
and lightly just real quick.

00:37:37.875 --> 00:37:39.375
Basically, this translates this way.

00:37:39.379 --> 00:37:42.435
He says, I want you to
learn how to experience.

00:37:42.944 --> 00:37:43.365
Shalom.

00:37:43.365 --> 00:37:46.605
Shalom, God's perfect peace.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:52.380
Everything that we walk through
in life, Jesus is the answer.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.770
Jesus understands what we've went through.

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:59.310
If you wanna wonder if Jesus went
through some burnout as Jesus being

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:02.820
the son of God, you would think, okay,
no, he didn't sin, but he was worn out.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:03.690
And you know what he did?

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.590
He rested.

00:38:04.595 --> 00:38:04.960
That's right.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:11.790
I mean, he has done so much for
us and so what do we need to do

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.500
to overcome our mental struggles?

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.120
We may need rest.

00:38:15.645 --> 00:38:18.225
We may need to create some
different rhythms, but I promise

00:38:18.225 --> 00:38:20.325
you, every one of us needs Jesus.

00:38:21.375 --> 00:38:25.785
So I'm gonna pray for us and then I wanna
lead you guys as we talk about invitation.

00:38:25.785 --> 00:38:28.455
I wanna lead you through invitation
on how we can seek the Lord.

00:38:28.635 --> 00:38:29.265
So let's pray.

00:38:29.265 --> 00:38:31.845
Lord Jesus, we are so thankful for you.

00:38:32.775 --> 00:38:34.515
We're so thankful for your love.

00:38:34.575 --> 00:38:36.045
We're so thankful for your Word.

00:38:36.705 --> 00:38:39.555
And Lord, as we dive into the
story of Elijah, Lord, there's

00:38:39.555 --> 00:38:40.875
so much more to this story.

00:38:40.875 --> 00:38:41.595
And Lord, I pray.

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:45.930
Many in this room, Lord, are intrigued
by the story of Elijah, and they'll

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:49.440
go read about the details and how
you showed up in his life and how you

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.299
worked in mighty and amazing ways.

00:38:52.529 --> 00:38:56.259
Lord, I pray that maybe they saw Elijah
and they've heard these stories and, and,

00:38:56.265 --> 00:39:03.000
and maybe they just feel accepted by you
because they see that there was a man that

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:10.110
loved you and served you and still fell
short and you still met him where he was.

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:14.580
Lord, one of the greatest things that
I see in this, and I pray that we

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:19.200
all see in this, is that when that
angel came, he did not judge Elijah.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.350
He did not say, Hey, you screwed up.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:27.570
He just ministered and he showed your
love and compassion to him and met

00:39:27.575 --> 00:39:32.490
his needs where he was to pick him up
and to strengthen him, to provide him

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:34.140
rest and to provide him perfect peace.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:37.950
And so, Lord, I'm praying that
over every person in this room.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:45.600
So as we continue invitation, I have just
been led of the Lord over the last several

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.879
weeks to lead you through invitation.

00:39:48.299 --> 00:39:51.089
Many times I say, Hey, just
pray and seek the Lord.

00:39:52.169 --> 00:39:54.390
But I, I really want
to continue to do that.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.910
So here's what I want you to do,
just where you're sitting, I want

00:39:56.915 --> 00:40:00.930
you to begin to just take a few
minutes and just process through.

00:40:01.725 --> 00:40:04.065
Everything that you've been
struggling with, it's burnout.

00:40:04.065 --> 00:40:08.505
If it's anxiety, if it's stress,
if it's worry, whatever you've

00:40:08.505 --> 00:40:12.105
been dealing with, I want you to
begin to to bring that to mind.

00:40:12.105 --> 00:40:16.125
And I want you to just imagine laying
that at Jesus' feet and laying it down.

00:40:16.335 --> 00:40:18.765
So I'm just gonna give you a little
bit of time to do that right now.

00:40:18.765 --> 00:40:23.025
So just imagine what you're dealing with
and begin laying it down at Jesus's feet.

00:40:53.385 --> 00:40:55.065
All right, so now here's
what I want you to do.

00:40:55.395 --> 00:40:58.605
Again, it's so important that we
begin to think through these things.

00:40:59.055 --> 00:41:04.575
So all those things that you've laid down
at his feet, I want you to just imagine

00:41:04.575 --> 00:41:10.185
him picking those up and laying them on
the cross and just putting them up on that

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:13.035
cross that he hung on and died for us.

00:41:13.305 --> 00:41:16.635
Just imagine him putting that worry up
there and, and all the stresses over

00:41:16.635 --> 00:41:22.095
just our jobs and our kids and just
our life and maybe our purpose in life.

00:41:22.095 --> 00:41:26.745
And just imagine putting them
on that cross and imagine Jesus.

00:41:28.875 --> 00:41:31.605
Taking those away.

00:41:33.315 --> 00:41:35.835
Imagine Jesus as he died on that cross.

00:41:37.335 --> 00:41:41.415
He paid for all that
He, he washed it away.

00:41:41.475 --> 00:41:45.405
He took it upon him so that you don't
have to bear that burden anymore.

00:41:45.675 --> 00:41:49.815
Jesus took it away once
and for all on the cross.

00:42:00.105 --> 00:42:03.585
And what I want you to do now is I
want you to just begin to praise Jesus.

00:42:04.095 --> 00:42:07.785
I know there's people in this room that
may not know Jesus through a personal

00:42:07.785 --> 00:42:12.765
relationship, personal relationship,
but I just in this moment, maybe you're

00:42:12.825 --> 00:42:15.495
just appraising Jesus for the first
time and you're saying Thank you for

00:42:15.495 --> 00:42:17.025
taking those things away from me.

00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:19.395
Just begin to say thank you.

00:42:20.415 --> 00:42:24.255
For removing the burden and allowing
us to be able to cast the carriers

00:42:24.255 --> 00:42:26.295
upon him because he cares for us.

00:42:26.625 --> 00:42:27.525
Just begin to say thank.

00:42:47.325 --> 00:42:52.965
Jesus, as we continue to just pray and
praise today, Lord, I'm praying that

00:42:52.995 --> 00:42:57.525
there were people in this room that
maybe for the first time were able

00:42:57.525 --> 00:43:02.265
to completely lay down the worries
that they have in their lives, the

00:43:02.265 --> 00:43:03.435
stresses that they have in their life.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.055
Lord and I, I pray that they were
for the first time maybe able to

00:43:08.055 --> 00:43:10.965
see that you took those from them.

00:43:12.345 --> 00:43:15.525
Lord, I'm praying that there are
many people that are gonna be able

00:43:15.525 --> 00:43:17.355
to leave here free of that burden.

00:43:17.655 --> 00:43:19.515
The burden that we put on ourselves.

00:43:19.905 --> 00:43:22.605
Lord, it's, it's too many
times we, we think it's all

00:43:22.605 --> 00:43:24.195
about us and what we can do.

00:43:25.935 --> 00:43:28.515
So, Lord, even help me
remember, Lord, that you.

00:43:29.865 --> 00:43:30.705
Take our cares.

00:43:33.255 --> 00:43:35.955
But Lord, I just pray as we,
we take some time to worship

00:43:35.955 --> 00:43:36.975
at the end of today's service.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:39.045
I pray that we worship like we are free.

00:43:39.405 --> 00:43:43.065
I pray that we worship like we've
experienced God's perfect peace.

00:43:46.635 --> 00:43:51.855
I pray, Lord, that you move in
our lives and I just pray this

00:43:51.855 --> 00:43:53.955
near heaven, the name, amen.

00:43:55.515 --> 00:43:57.495
I wanna mention one thing
before we stand in worship.

00:43:57.734 --> 00:44:00.734
And this is something I feel the Lord
has continued to remind me of this.

00:44:00.734 --> 00:44:04.725
There's many times during our time of
invitation, I present the gospel who Jesus

00:44:04.725 --> 00:44:08.325
is and how you can give your life to Jesus
because Jesus came to die for your sins.

00:44:08.325 --> 00:44:12.674
And that he's been given us freedom
from our sins and our brokenness.

00:44:12.855 --> 00:44:15.795
And I've done that by just closing your
eyes and having you raise your hands

00:44:15.799 --> 00:44:16.935
if you wanna give your life to Jesus.

00:44:16.935 --> 00:44:19.815
And many times, you know, people
just don't respond and that's okay.

00:44:19.815 --> 00:44:21.464
That's maybe where you're at in your life.

00:44:22.755 --> 00:44:24.045
But I, I think.

00:44:25.005 --> 00:44:31.095
That it's so important that we
look eye to eye and we say, Hey,

00:44:32.145 --> 00:44:34.455
has there ever been a point that
you've given your life to Jesus?

00:44:36.225 --> 00:44:37.425
Ask yourself that question.

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:40.485
Has there ever been a point that
you've given your life to Jesus?

00:44:41.355 --> 00:44:46.065
Have you ever experienced
his freedom, his his peace?

00:44:47.235 --> 00:44:53.025
Cuz if you're in this room and you
haven't, today is the day, not tomorrow.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:58.230
I'm telling you, not tomorrow,
but today is the day of salvation.

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:03.840
And I pray that if you need to give your
life to Jesus, if you need to give your

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.480
life to Jesus, or if you need to give your
life to Jesus, that you'll do that today.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:07.800
We're gonna do this.

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:08.580
Eyes open.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.440
This is how we give our life to Jesus.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:12.240
We admit our need.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.610
So right now, if you're looking at
me and you're saying, you know what?

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:16.590
I need Jesus right now.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.830
You admit your need, just tell
the Lord right now in your heart.

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.300
I need Jesus.

00:45:22.095 --> 00:45:25.485
Admit that you need him to forgive you
of your sins and to help you experience

00:45:25.485 --> 00:45:30.975
a new life, then right where you're
sitting, as simple as it is, all you

00:45:30.975 --> 00:45:32.775
have to say is, Jesus, come into my life.

00:45:33.255 --> 00:45:37.035
Come into my life right now
and live in and through me.

00:45:37.395 --> 00:45:39.795
Help me experience that
perfect peace that you have.

00:45:40.545 --> 00:45:43.005
In this moment, you can give your
life to Jesus, right where you're

00:45:43.005 --> 00:45:44.175
sitting with your eyes open.

00:45:44.175 --> 00:45:47.295
It's not a special prayer,
it's an attitude of our hearts.

00:45:47.385 --> 00:45:50.355
And when you ask Jesus to come into
your life, and if you did that right

00:45:50.355 --> 00:45:53.595
now, right now, here's what Jesus is
saying, I have come into your life

00:45:53.655 --> 00:45:56.835
and I have saved you from your sins,
and I have transformed your life.

00:45:56.985 --> 00:46:01.065
And from today on I will live in and
through you and you will experience

00:46:01.065 --> 00:46:03.285
my hope and my joy and my love.

00:46:04.605 --> 00:46:08.895
Here's my challenge, if you have given
your life to Jesus, Right now through

00:46:08.895 --> 00:46:13.395
admitting those things and accepting him,
we celebrate with you because God has so

00:46:13.395 --> 00:46:16.575
transformed so many of our lives here,
and we are here to continue to celebrate

00:46:16.605 --> 00:46:19.335
and walk alongside you in this life.

00:46:20.805 --> 00:46:24.075
God has not called you to stand alone,
and so my last challenge to you is

00:46:24.075 --> 00:46:26.984
if you've given your life to Jesus,
that you don't keep it to yourself.

00:46:27.345 --> 00:46:29.955
You don't have to raise your hand
right now, but here's my challenge.

00:46:29.955 --> 00:46:33.105
If you give, gave your life to Jesus
today that you'll come and find me.

00:46:33.645 --> 00:46:36.045
And you'll say, pastor Ben, you're
gonna have to call me Pastor.

00:46:36.045 --> 00:46:38.505
Just say, Hey Ben, if you don't
know my name, just say, Hey you.

00:46:39.015 --> 00:46:39.855
That works for me.

00:46:39.975 --> 00:46:40.335
Okay?

00:46:41.085 --> 00:46:42.735
Just say, Hey, I gave my life to Jesus.

00:46:43.365 --> 00:46:45.675
And when you share that with me,
number one, I'm gonna, I'm gonna

00:46:45.675 --> 00:46:50.085
celebrate with you, but number two,
I wanna walk with you, not only me.

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:50.835
Here's the cool part.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.345
We have a family that wants to
walk with you, link arms and

00:46:54.345 --> 00:46:55.575
say, Hey, let's talk about it.

00:46:56.685 --> 00:46:58.455
Let's talk about what it
means to follow Jesus.

00:46:58.455 --> 00:47:00.765
Let's talk about what it means
to understand the Bible more and

00:47:00.765 --> 00:47:02.145
understand who God has called us to be.

00:47:02.145 --> 00:47:05.504
And we'll do that, and it's a
journey, but let's do it together.

00:47:06.285 --> 00:47:07.725
So that's my last ploy to you.

00:47:07.725 --> 00:47:09.855
Please, today, before you
leave, if you gave your life

00:47:09.855 --> 00:47:11.895
to Jesus, come and talk to me.

00:47:12.435 --> 00:47:15.044
But here's what we're gonna do
now as an opportunity within at

00:47:15.044 --> 00:47:17.384
the end of invitation is we get
to worship Jesus on the way out.

00:47:17.714 --> 00:47:18.314
So let's do this.

00:47:18.314 --> 00:47:19.064
Let's stand.

00:47:20.595 --> 00:47:21.884
I'm gonna stand back here in the back.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:24.075
If you need prayer, you wanna talk
to me, I'm gonna talk with you.

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:26.520
And, um, we're gonna
worship, so let's worship.
