00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.600
you all ready to jump into the word wow all 
right let me ask that again are y'all ready to  

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.000
jump into the word there we go 
hey awesome um well first off um  

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.360
don't know about you guys but i enjoyed worship 
this morning i enjoyed just the opportunity  

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.280
um to give my breath back to god i'm just reminded 
that when we worship we're literally giving back  

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.600
to god what he gave to us right so in those 
moments to do that to take some time to pray  

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.360
you know today we're going to talk about prayer 
that's going to be our main focus as we finish  

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.480
the book of ephesians so if you're wanting to 
turn to where we're going we're going to be in  

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.400
ephesians chapter six uh we're going to start 
in verse 18 and lord willing we will finish  

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.920
the book of ephesians um and so praise 
god but just just thinking through  

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.680
why do we pray in service you know a lot of 
times you'll hear these statements well we  

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.280
pray to transition service right so like we 
transition from the beginning of service to  

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.920
worship to preaching and all those times i think 
are great because it's obviously just praying over  

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.760
those things but prayer is so much more than 
that we're going to learn about that today  

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.360
we're going to learn just how prayer is 
important together right why did we take  

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.160
time this morning to stop and pray because it's 
so important for each one of us to individually  

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.880
cast our carers on the lord seek the lord ask the 
lord to open our hearts to move in our lives and  

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.000
move in other people's lives and so as we'll 
talk more today prayer is so important um but  

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.960
we're really just again we're we're gonna walk 
through and and finish the book of ephesians  

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.080
and i just want to give you a couple of 
snippets here's some things that we have learned  

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.680
i'm not getting comfortable up here as you can 
tell there's nothing comfortable here we go  

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.320
this is what we're going to kind of review just 
briefly what we have learned in ephesians and so  

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.520
um one of the things that we realize is that 
the writer of ephesians is paul the apostle  

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.800
and based upon his writings he had to be you know 
on a yacht somewhere living the easy life just  

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.240
wanting to encourage people right but the exact 
opposite was happening he was in prison in chains  

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.720
really on trial for his life that ultimately 
he would die yet he spent the last little  

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.120
bit of his life writing a letter to 
the ephesians to encourage them wow  

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.200
like that would happen but yes paul wanted to 
encourage not only the ephesians but it's made  

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.360
it all the way to us and so if you're hearing 
the word of god today you he wrote this for you  

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.880
to be encouraged so we see that we see that he 
reminded us of our security in christ and our  

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.560
calling as followers of of jesus he's reminded us 
to have unity we talked about unity in the church  

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.280
unity in the our relationships with our spouse 
unity and our relationships with our children  

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.320
and here's the fun one unity in our relationships 
in our workplace so we learned all of those things  

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.320
and the last thing that paul has been reminding 
us and we've been walking through this over the  

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.920
last three weeks and today will conclude is this 
armor of god is finally he says finally put on the  

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.120
armor of god and so we've walked through all this 
armor that god has told us to put on and then he's  

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.160
covering it in prayer he's covering every bit of 
it in prayer and this is where we get to verse 18.  

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.480
and so he's going to remind us in order to win 
the battles in our life and so just a reminder  

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.960
whether you realize or not you're in a 
battle every one of us is in a battle  

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.640
and if we realize we're in a battle we know we 
need to fight that battle with the lord's vast  

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.680
strength and and in that uh we realize today here 
is that our power in our battles comes from the  

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.320
lord through prayer right our prayer life is 
where we get power and direction from god to  

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.080
win the battles and so before we jump into this 
i want to start with this basic thing and maybe  

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.920
again if you're comfortable with this great 
if not we'll just be quiet here but i love  

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.400
just being able to engage you guys a little 
bit with questions but what is the purpose  

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.680
of prayer somebody answer that for me for you what 
is the purpose of prayer what do you believe it is

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.440
just to talk to god okay that's great 
it's great anybody else want to give  

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.840
something that's a good start 
what's the purpose of prayer

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.000
understand his will for your life what do you got

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.840
asking him to guide you right good anybody else  

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.480
none of these are wrong by the way so 
i'm just wanting more okay yep absolutely  

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.400
right i think there's multiple reasons why we 
pray why god wants us to pray and i think every  

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.560
one of those you guys mentioned is exactly part 
of it right and today we'll even expand more on  

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.960
that right so even i wrote down this like to 
hear from god to talk to god to cast our cares  

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.000
upon him and so prayer is so important because 
i think about this do you think you could go  

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.840
through your day without communicating 
anything to anyone anybody probably not  

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.200
so when i think about prayer is i would have 
the end i wouldn't be able to communicate  

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.440
god wouldn't be able to communicate back to 
me without a conversation with him and that's  

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.680
where we have prayer and so when we pray 
it's an act of surrender whenever i think  

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.920
about prayer it's really saying this that i'm 
humbling myself to know that i need somebody  

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.040
outside of myself to give me wisdom to give 
me encouragement to give me direction right  

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.760
it's it's humbling right but it's also freeing i 
think about in prayer at the moment that i pray i  

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.480
get to cast every single care that i have that 
i felt like i was supposed to handle on my own  

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.200
and i get to give that over to the lord and 
now it's not mine he says my burdens are light  

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.440
right and i love that and so i'll share 
this quote with you i've shared it  

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.840
multiple times but it's something that 
i want us as a church to be defined by  

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.480
and it's this this vance pitman said 
this he says we don't pray before we work  

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.200
prayer is the work and then god works the 
reason why i love that quote is just this idea  

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.320
that i know so i'll just talk about 
personally here is that i struggle with  

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.000
asking god to bless what i pray like okay lord 
bless what i'm getting ready to go do in jesus  

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.520
name amen or i pray give me give me give me 
amen but that's i'm just talking about me i  

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.760
don't know about you so i'm asking god to bless 
whatever i want but then whenever i think about  

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.280
the intention of prayer his prayer is really about 
humbling ourselves and asking god what he wants  

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.040
and when we do share with the lord what we 
desire we're really truly asking the lord to  

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.120
either change our hearts or confirm it and so 
we're going to jump into this text i don't want  

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.160
to keep one one off there but let's jump in this 
text and just see what paul says about prayer  

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:56.720
and so we're going to start in verse 18 ephesians 
chapter 6 and here's what it says it says may well  

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.960
where am i here hey might want 
to turn to the right page here

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.640
all right it says pray at all times in the spirit  

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.880
with every prayer and request and stay alert with 
all perseverance intercession for all the saints  

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.800
pray also for me that the message may be 
given to me when i open my mouth and when  

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.480
when i open my mouth to make known 
with boldness the mystery of the gospel  

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:29.920
for this i am an ambassador in chains pray that 
i might be bold enough to speak about it as i  

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.520
should he says tychius our dearly loved brother 
and faithful servant and the lord will tell you  

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.200
all the news about me so that you may be informed 
i'm sending him to you for this very reason to  

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:47.680
let you know how we are and to encourage your 
pray assuming peace to the brothers and sisters  

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.520
and love with faith from god our father 
and the lord jesus christ grace be with you  

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.640
who have an undying love for our lord jesus 
christ so we see here and we're just going to  

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.720
kind of start walking through these verses verse 
18 the first thing he says is pray at all times  

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:11.760
just so you know uh you probably already know 
this but i i typically teach or preach however  

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.440
you want to call it in the most simplest way i 
can because for me if i don't do it that way it  

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.600
doesn't make sense to me so i hope like you're 
it's not like i'm bringing this great amazing  

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.280
difference other than what the 
word says here but really just  

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.200
seeing what god says in the word and so it says 
this pray at all times that's logical right and so  

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.120
if we're supposed to pray at all 
times i'm going to ask a duh question  

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.800
because sometimes we need to remind ourselves 
of this is there any time we shouldn't pray

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.440
no see that's an easy one right when but are 
there times that you don't pray raise your  

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.000
hand are there times you don't pray okay so it's 
not getting through our heads and our hearts and  

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.760
our minds and i'm glad i'm not the only one 
okay so this is where i was reminding my wife  

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.520
this morning so my wife her grandma passed away 
this last thursday and one of the things that  

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.400
um has been on her mind and heart the last 
couple days is she's gotten more and more  

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.560
anxiety about what's going to happen and how 
we're supposed to get there and all these things  

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.120
and this is what i told her you need to renew your 
mind on the word of god and his truth so i've been  

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.480
given her scripture and sometimes this is what we 
have to do in order to get something in our minds  

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.200
and in our hearts and in our lives to apply it 
is to repeat it right the more that we think on  

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.000
something the more that we will actually begin to 
believe it and follow it so if you're wondering  

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.360
what do you take home maybe this is the only take 
home you have take verse 18 plastered on your  

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.280
car dash maybe it's on your phone screen maybe 
it's on your bathroom window i don't know where  

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.960
you want it posted but maybe it's just a reminder 
that you're supposed to pray at all times but  

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:49.840
here's the great one i'm gonna put this out to you 
guys how do we pray at all times is that possible

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.760
anybody i think at times we do 
feel like it's impossible so let's  

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.960
let's let's talk a little bit about that first is 
when you think of prayer this is typically what i  

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.880
think about i think about prayer is only when i 
close my eyes and i'm just maybe thinking like  

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.040
you think when we close our eyes and we're 
muttering something out loud that's prayer  

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.520
well actually prayer is more than that it's really 
just a conversation with god that can happen with  

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:23.120
your eyes open it can happen in your drive 
or in the shower or on your knees in a closet  

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.600
it can happen anyway but when we think about 
praying it's not that praying out loud and if  

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.920
if that's what we think it is then we think how 
do we go to work and this is just me imagining you  

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.280
going to work praying without stopping right it's 
a you're going to work you're praying out loud and  

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.720
all of a sudden a co-worker comes up and wants 
to talk to you no i'm praying i've got to stop  

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.960
you know the lord won't let me stop and pray right 
that's what we think of but here's let me give a  

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:51.200
couple of examples what this looks like right is 
when he says this he says pray at all times what  

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:57.680
he's saying is that our conversation should always 
be open to the lord we should actively be thinking  

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.160
and knowing that the lord's presence is with us 
and we're talking to him as the spirit leads us  

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:08.240
to talk to him we know that he is present with 
us everywhere we go and so we should never leave  

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.640
his presence right from the moment that we wake 
up till the moment we lay down god is always there  

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:19.360
ever present so that anytime you have a thought or 
decision to make or a concern that you just give  

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.440
it to the lord whether it's with your eyes open 
whether it's on your knees or whether it's while  

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.840
you're driving that's really what paul is talking 
about sometimes we over complicate what prayer is  

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.000
because there are times where we need to be on 
our knees in our closets by ourselves because  

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.080
there's times in the world it tells us to do 
that but there are times where it's just being  

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.800
consistently actively present with the lord every 
day in every conversation so i think about this  

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.800
example so laura and orville if you don't know 
who they are um it's one of our families here they  

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.680
just had a baby um congratulations to them they're 
not here so they don't even hear that so i don't  

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:55.440
know why i said that but um we're celebrating with 
them but but the day before as i was talking with  

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.560
lauren orville they were anxious right they were 
anxious and this is what laura said she said ben  

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:07.840
i feel like that the enemy is yelling at me and 
i said you know what laura you're right the enemy  

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:13.920
has to yell because he's so far away but the 
lord he whispers because he's right next to you  

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.240
see when you hear a yell it's of the enemy 
when you hear a whisper it's of the lord  

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.640
see those moments that the lord is 
always present he's never a moment away  

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.160
and when you can't hear him you know what he's 
doing he's whispering lower so that you get closer  

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.000
unless you get closer because those 
are the moments you need the lord  

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.200
when you hear the screams when you hear 
the loud noises and you hear negativity  

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.000
and things that just really frustrate 
you and anxiety it is not of the lord  

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.280
he said he has not given us a spirit of fear so 
when i think about that just that reminder with  

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.320
them is reminding them of how important it is but 
also i just think about this really praying all  

00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:00.240
the time is just being consistently open to the 
lord i heard it referenced this way it's leaving  

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.560
the phone off the hook and if you're too young 
to understand what that means i'm sorry but it  

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.560
means that you're always open communication with 
the lord in everything that you do right so psalm  

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:16.400
46 1 says this god is our refuge and strength a 
helper who is always found in times of trouble  

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.520
so we win our daily battles by praying at all 
times that's paul's first statement we win our  

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:30.080
daily battles by praying at all times so now he 
says in the second part of this this verse pray  

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.720
at all times in the spirit there's a moment where 
you stop and you say what does it mean to be in  

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.680
the spirit and depending on what your background 
is that can mean a little bit of different things  

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:44.640
but whenever i looked into this a little bit more 
we begin to realize in the spirit really means in  

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:49.520
the will of god um over our lives and for those 
around us and so i'm just going to quote romans  

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.120
uh chapter 8 verse 26 through 27 to give a little 
bit of context with this of when he talks about  

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:02.320
praying in the spirit and this is what paul says 
in romans uh he says in the same way the spirit  

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.640
also helps us in our weaknesses because 
we do not know what to pray as we should  

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.800
so it says but the spirit himself intercedes for 
us when it with inexplicable groanings and for he  

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.520
who searches our hearts knows the mind 
of the spirit because he intercedes for  

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.880
the saints according to the will of god so 
when we pray in the spirit the spirit of god  

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:31.200
helps us pray in the will of god but there's more 
to this right praying in the spirit really as a  

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.000
believer that's what we should do um you know 
god's kingdom come but let me ask the question  

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.840
maybe this help a little bit more what's the 
opposite of praying in the spirit anybody know

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:52.160
okay praying in the flesh so praying in the flesh 
would mean selfish praying all about me all my  

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.360
concerns nothing that i'm even seeking the lord 
for it's not about anything god's concerned so  

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.640
praying in the spirit is the lord's will praying 
in the flesh would be my desires my personal  

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.400
um benefit in all of it right and so if we 
have a battle with the enemy he wants us to  

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:14.800
pray selfishly but if we want to win our battles 
we need to pray in the spirit and so the question  

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.240
that many of you have and this is the one i had so 
you know i write my messages this way i write it  

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:26.240
out and i go okay that makes sense but now how 
do i know if what i'm praying is in the spirit  

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.680
how do i know well there's a couple of ways this 
is something just personally for me and me and my  

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:37.200
wife brittany have talked through this a lot how 
do we pray the desires of our heart but surrender  

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:42.400
to the will and i said that's exactly what you do 
you pray the desires of your heart you're asking  

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.960
the lord to give you pure motives and what 
you're praying in the end you surrender all  

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:52.560
outcomes to the lord pray the desires of your 
heart pray what you feel god leading you to do  

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.120
if it's to change a job or it's to heal you or if 
it's to change somebody else's heart or is it to  

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.720
help you to forgive someone i don't know 
what it is pray it if the lord lays in here  

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:06.320
pray it and when you're praying you say lord not 
my will but your will be done and you want to  

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:12.560
know where we get that from jesus himself in the 
garden when he was asking god to take away the  

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:19.200
cup which means take away him having to sacrifice 
himself for our sins and even jesus himself said  

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.360
not my will but your will so if you want to know 
how to pray in the spirit in the will of god  

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.360
pray the desires of your heart what you feel 
that god's leading you to pray but surrender  

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.560
the outcome to the lord that's not easy i'm not 
saying it's easy but i'm just i'm just getting  

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.800
practical here it is the way to do it here's 
another way if you want to know what to pray

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.680
look at the word of god the word of god gives us 
clear things to say he you know what he desires  

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.000
to seek and save that basically that which is 
lost right anybody that doesn't know the lord  

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.600
so if you pray for somebody that's lost you 
know you're praying in the spirit so as you  

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.520
read his word you'll see him consistently 
affirm our prayers pray for healing pray for  

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.360
you know somebody for forgiveness right pray 
for somebody to forgive you or you to free  

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.320
like there's multiple things in the world 
so if you need a guide go to the word right  

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:13.360
so to win our daily battles we not only pray at 
all times but we pray in the spirit but then he  

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.680
he goes on here and again just it's cool how 
he breaks this down he says pray at all times  

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:23.760
in the spirit with every prayer i thought there 
was one prayer like is there just one way to pray  

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.200
and paul's saying there's actually multiple ways 
to pray here we pray with all prayers or every  

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:36.160
prayer right and so let me ask this question 
when you typically pray what are the things  

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.800
that you say anybody want to kind of what are 
some things you typically say in your prayers

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.680
what do you okay forgive me this is a great 
one right so you ask for forgiveness continue  

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.720
forgiveness for yourself or for someone else 
that's great somebody else what else do you  

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.080
typically pray what's just maybe a part of your 
routine thank you so we're looking at praise  

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.440
we're looking at repentance anybody else  

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.360
wisdom so we're asking i love this this is great 
because you're really hitting on everything  

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.800
that i'm getting ready to share what's 
the what's anything else anybody else  

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.560
guidance that's a good one guidance and 
wisdom i think go together anybody else

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.480
interceding that's another one right so 
interceding is on somebody else's behalf so you're  

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.680
asking that god move in in the place of their life 
so the last one that i would even share here would  

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:34.400
be the one that i mentioned is surrendering or 
yielding so let me go back here praise repenting  

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:42.560
asking and yielding does anybody know what that 
makes up pray i've taught them this lately the  

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:49.040
acronym p-r-a-y pray if you wonder how to pray 
that's one of the greatest ways okay and i'm not  

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.720
saying this is like it's not like god put that in 
there and said hey use this acronym but i would  

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:57.600
say for me those are elements of all kinds of 
prayers that god asked us to pray there's more of  

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.880
them intercession wasn't in that pray why i mean 
it's intercessions asking right but it helps you  

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.400
when you go into your prayer and you say what do 
i pray well i'm gonna start with praising god god  

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.360
thank you that i'm breathing that i have my family 
that have my health that you've been with me  

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.520
whatever it is repent i'm telling you this if 
you don't have something to repent of today  

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.680
you might want to check yourself because maybe 
it's just me i'm repenting every day because  

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.480
there's something in my mind or my negative heart 
i've been asking god for like pre-forgiveness  

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.760
since yesterday let me explain what that means 
this next week as we travel back to oklahoma  

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:35.680
i know that i'm going to struggle with all the 
travel and all the uncomfortableness i know it i'm  

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.160
asking the lord to forgive me now and the lord to 
help me sustain me not say something i shouldn't  

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:47.360
say and not act like a stupid person i'm sorry 
but i know myself so i'm pre-praying yes those are  

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.200
those are types of prayers so he says pray with 
all kinds of prayers and if you're wondering also  

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.920
how do we pray the disciples ask the same question 
so let's talk about matthew 6 9-13 maybe these  

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.520
are verses you need to write down matthew 6 9-13 
says this okay they says hey jesus can you teach  

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.640
us how to pray he says hey pray like this he says 
therefore you should pray like this our father in  

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.560
heaven your name be honored is holy your kingdom 
come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven  

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.360
give us today our daily bread and forgive us of 
our debts as we have also forgiven our debtors  

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.480
and do not bring us into temptation but deliver 
us from the evil one see this is a great example  

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.760
if you're asking this question how's how do we 
pray all prayers maybe we just take jesus prayer  

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.920
and we lay that before us each day and we pray 
those elements i mean if you walk through it  

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:40.160
it's basically addressing god you're praising him 
you're asking for his will to be done his kingdom  

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:47.920
to come to provide your needs to forgive your 
sins right and to protect you those are great  

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:54.560
ways to pray all prayers so again paul is saying 
in order to defeat our enemy right we win our  

00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:00.560
battles in our life by praying all prayers by 
praying all the time by praying in the spirit  

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:07.920
to me this is an extension of the armor this is an 
extension of the armor we put on all these armors  

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.720
to protect ourselves against the enemy but 
prayer is the power and i'm going to give this  

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:21.520
illustration would anybody get in a nice brand new 
truck that you just bought and never put gas in it  

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.240
anybody i mean i'm pretty sure you just wouldn't 
want to hang out in your parking i mean your house  

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:31.520
the rest of your life and just be like that's 
pretty cool so god's given us the armor shiny  

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:35.840
nice protective you know you guys in your big 
trucks you feel like you can own the road right  

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:43.840
but if we don't put the fuel in 
the truck it will never be useful  

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.200
so you understand i understand fuels the spirit 
of god so it means god that lives inside of us  

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.800
but prayer is how we know what's 
in there prayer is how we know  

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:59.040
what power we have what direction we should go how 
we're supposed to get there what to watch out for  

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:06.160
so you are a well-oiled machine you're a truck i 
know this horrible illustration i'm probably the  

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:12.720
one of the worst illustrators so please just bear 
with me but put prayer in your life all prayers  

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.760
put the spirit in your life the power 
these are things that will help you  

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.640
as you fight the battles in your life 
because you are we all are and if

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.600
we'll miss the greatest thing if 
we don't share this with others  

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:37.920
if we only receive this and we don't share with 
others so let's keep going right so he says  

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.320
prayed all times in the spirit with 
every prayer and request and stay alert

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:50.320
what does stay alert me it's to watch and 
pray so this is where we say stay alert if  

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:56.240
you all remember nehemiah nehemiah they had 
a weapon in one hand and like a trowel on  

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.680
the other hand as they were building the wall 
they were watching and working right so for us  

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:08.240
as we serve the lord as we live our lives out 
we're attentively watching for the enemy's attacks  

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:14.080
right we're alert and we're aware we know that 
our enemy is the deceiver so anything that comes  

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.400
in that loud voice that comes in we're filtering 
through the word of god and we're lifting it up  

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.520
in prayer for god to remind us to be aware that 
the enemy is going to try to twist what we are  

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.400
thinking or what we're hearing right but it 
leads us to the next point he says to stay alert  

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.200
with all perseverance and and 
so we'll stop there so with all  

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:39.120
perseverance and so when you think about 
perseverance what do you guys think of

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.240
what does it mean to persevere

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:52.000
keep going don't give up right don't give 
up so when we pray don't just pray once  

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.520
and expect that that's going to cover you 
for a week or month consistently go before  

00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.240
the lord consistently ask the lord's will for 
your life consistently ask the lord for grace  

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:06.160
and mercy and peace and forgiveness so we need 
to be persistent to stick to it to not quit  

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.080
so persevering in prayer is consistently 
seeking the lord's will you know in our  

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:16.320
lives right until he either answers or the 
spirit tells you to stop praying for it right  

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.760
i remember hearing this from robert law he says 
prayer is not getting man's will done in heaven  

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:26.960
it's getting god's will done on earth so if you 
want to fulfill god's call on your life so one of  

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:32.800
the things you hear us as a church our mission is 
to help you help everyone discover god's purpose  

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.520
for their life through a relationship with jesus 
if you truly want to know what god wants you to do  

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.240
with the rest of your life and if you're breathing 
right now he's not done right if you want to know  

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:48.720
prayer is the channel to receive what 
god desires for you to do through  

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.200
being aware and persevering right not 
giving up not giving up praying for your  

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.480
neighbors not giving up praying for your 
lost loved ones not giving up praying for  

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:06.160
healing not giving up praying for your own heart 
maybe that can't forgive don't give up right  

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.600
i believe each one of us are where we are 
today because of someone else's answered prayer  

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.440
and here's one of the coolest parts i've 
shared this before but i'm going to share  

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.120
it again because i think it's good to remember 
there's power in remembering what god's done  

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:27.840
every person sitting in this room is an answer to 
me and my wife's prayer over a year and a half ago  

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:33.120
what do you mean a year and a half ago when we 
moved here we prayed that god would bring people  

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.720
to the church and join our team and help us reach 
our city and be able to serve the city if you're  

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.040
wondering what all this is we joined with our 
local schools to provide clean supplies and  

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.280
hygiene items and to pack these bags and to bring 
it to them and this is more about what we want to  

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.000
do and so every one of you are a huge part of what 
god's doing here and we prayed for you a year and  

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.360
a half ago so you are the result of someone else's 
answered prayer maybe it's your relationship with  

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.960
jesus maybe you wouldn't came to faith in jesus 
without somebody praying for you that's my story  

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.280
my aunts in florida prayed for me and the moment 
i gave my life to christ at 23 they called me and  

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:09.200
they said then we've been praying for you 
since you were a kid wow so why is praying  

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.600
matter why does persistent prayer matter 
jenna's not even in here but her brother  

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.120
came to faith in christ because of their 
family's persistent prayer for her brother  

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.240
don't give up prayer is powerful and it's 
cool to see how god works through prayer  

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.400
so when we want to win our battles 
right we don't give up in our prayers  

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.920
and so we're going to kind of see this last 
part where i love paul not only says to pray  

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:40.160
but then he actually is an example 
to us to ask for prayer anybody here  

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:46.000
not they're too prideful to ask for help i 
mean hey there's a heavy washer and britney  

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.160
says why don't you call brock to come over and 
help you with nah i got it i got it next thing  

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.160
you know my back's hurting right we're prideful 
which means this we don't like to ask for help  

00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:01.360
but paul set the example in asking for help 
through prayer so here's what he says in verse uh  

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.600
20 or actually it's the back end of 18 and 
then 19 and 20. he says with all perseverance  

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.520
with intercession for all the saints right so the 
intercession he comes back to this he talks about  

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.080
intercession interceding for the saints well who's 
the saints he says well here pray for me also  

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.520
that the message may be given to me when i open my 
mouth and make known with boldness the mystery of  

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:27.200
the gospel for this i am an ambassador in chains 
for that i might be bold enough to speak about it  

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:34.080
as i should so we don't just pray by ourselves 
right but for all believers and encourage them  

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.360
we intercede for them and we link arms with other 
believers we win the battles we're facing because  

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:45.920
of that and i love how paul models that right if 
paul needed prayer if you were to study the book  

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:52.160
of books all that paul wrote and what god did 
through paul god did amazing things and paul's  

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.280
saying hey pray for me i'm pretty sure every one 
of us needs to say hey pray for me before we leave  

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:05.200
because we all need prayer what did he say 
to be bold to have the words to speak this  

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.640
guy that just wrote this amazing 
letter to the ephesians is asking  

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.720
for the ephesians to pray for him i mean isn't 
he strong enough isn't he smart enough i mean  

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.680
he's got all this wisdom no he needed prayer 
so prayer is important right so he says pray  

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.320
for all believers and he says pray that they're 
bold again that he's bold to speak as he should  

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.560
and so you're not alone if you've ever struggled 
with boldness have you ever struggled with  

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:36.240
boldness in your faith and you're not alone but 
maybe you've left yourself alone by not asking  

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:41.920
for somebody to pray for you to be bold you know 
i think that's what god reminded me in this text  

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.760
you know i want to be bold in my faith but have 
i asked you know i've asked paul back here to  

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:53.360
pray for me to be bold no i haven't why haven't 
i probably pride because i maybe i don't see  

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:59.920
prayer as important but after today paul will you 
pray for me this week to be bold in my faith see  

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:06.560
that's what we should do we should be open and 
honest when we're struggling and and like amanda  

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.760
shared here sometimes i can't go before the lord 
you know what she does she texts the ladies in our  

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:16.400
group and she says i'm struggling can you pray for 
me you know what they do they intercede for her  

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:23.680
that is church that is the body of believers 
that's what we want to be because we want  

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.480
to be that for more than just this room that's 
why we keep inviting that's why we keep praying  

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.800
that's why we keep believing that god's 
gonna do some amazing things through us  

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:39.840
if we believe that prayer matters if we 
believe that prayer is the power behind  

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:46.720
winning the battles in our life see all battles 
are won together and not alone this is where i'll  

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:51.200
just kind of finish up the rest of it where 
it says 21 through 24 and i'm not going to  

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.760
read all of it but he talks about tychus which 
is a great name i'm naming my next child which  

00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:02.720
i'm not having but i'll name him that but tychius 
was encouraging to paul again i'll tell you this  

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:09.600
there's certain people in my life that encourage 
me that if somebody's like hey you know what  

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.280
so-and-so needs encouragement i wouldn't want to 
send them because they've been such an encourager  

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.440
for me i want to keep them but paul said no i'm 
in prison and i'm going to send one of my greatest  

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:23.120
encouragers to you to give you a report of what 
god's done in my life but also to encourage  

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:31.440
see all of our battles are won together not 
alone and so paul knew that and so he sent  

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.000
his friend tychius to encourage them and it blows 
my mind again that he would want to encourage the  

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.600
ephesians while he's in prison and not just beg 
for getting them get him out of there break him  

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:47.920
out of there right so paul sets this amazing 
example of needing prayer needing prayer so  

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:54.640
for you how do we end ephesians how do we end this 
message over prayer what do we need to consider  

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.720
we're going to have a time of invitation why do 
we give time for invitation it's the moment where  

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.960
we hear information we process through 
what god's taught us and we say okay god  

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:11.440
what do i need to take home invitation says i'm 
going to evaluate and respond evaluate and respond  

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:18.320
what did god teach you today maybe god reminded 
you of something that you've just missed for a  

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:24.000
while one is that it's just prayers powerful 
prayers needed to win the battles in our life  

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.960
maybe it's just the reminder that we need to 
pray at all times and it's not as complicated as  

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:33.680
we make it maybe it's reminding ourselves that 
we need to pray in the spirit not in the flesh  

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.680
maybe it's just a reminder that we need 
to pray all prayers that we need to pray  

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:45.840
more than just give me give me give me and 
we need to pray more use me use me use me  

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:53.600
i don't know what it is that god taught you 
spoke to you about but i pray that his word  

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:59.280
i know it so i'm claiming it today his word 
will not return void if it was spoke today  

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.880
it is in your heart and i pray that 
god challenges you to respond to it  

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.400
but this is the last thing 
that i want to want to say

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:14.560
prayer is useless and so you hear my heart in this 
prayer is useless without a relationship with the  

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:20.800
person you pray to god says that the moment that 
you give your life to him you have full access  

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:28.160
to god that's romans 5 full access but when you 
are praying without really even recognizing that  

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:33.360
god is the lord of your life the one who saved 
you from your sins that can give you a new life  

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:40.720
he's not hearing you and what i mean by that 
he's hearing you but he's saying hey first get  

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.800
your relationship right with me okay so here's 
what it means to get a relationship all right  

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.920
with the lord doesn't mean you're perfect but 
it doesn't mean that you recognize your need for  

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:58.080
jesus see god loved you so much that he saw you in 
your condition and so we understand our condition  

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.560
that we are sinners which means we have fallen 
short of god's glory sin is not god's best for you  

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:08.960
and that is the condition that we were born 
into may be raised into until the day that  

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:14.560
we realized our need because we could not save 
ourselves that at the end of our life if we don't  

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:20.720
ask for forgiveness from the lord and receive his 
payment on the cross we'll pay for our sins but  

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:25.120
god said that's not good enough for me so god said 
i love you so much that i'm going to send my son  

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:32.080
to die a perfect life so that it can cover every 
sin that you have sinned and that you will sin and  

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:36.320
that's not an encouragement to keep on sinning 
but it is saying this is that he has given you  

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:42.240
full access to him but he's not going to force 
you see god loves you so much that he wants you  

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:47.200
to have that free choice so that it can be a 
relationship and not just a forced relationship  

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:56.640
so the opportunities there today forgiveness 
hope power through prayer access to god  

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.640
24 7. you don't need me for that 
you need a personal relationship  

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.160
so my encouragement for you if you've never given 
your life to jesus or you just have questions  

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.040
about what it means to give your life to jesus 
or maybe you're questioning whether you do have  

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.080
a relationship with jesus i'm here i'm not here 
to judge you i'm here to guide you we're going  

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.520
to use god's word to do that right to guide 
you through where you are in your relationship  

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:24.320
maybe it's just you need prayer to 
pray bolder to pray more confidently  

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.240
i'm here during invitation i'm gonna stand 
in the back i want to be there for you  

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:34.240
there's so many in this church that want to be 
there for you so don't do it alone so if you want  

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:39.440
to know the lord come talk to me if you want to 
be prayed for and courage come talk to me because  

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:46.080
i know how important it is to do this 
together don't go into your battles alone  

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:53.200
has designed us to link arms to do this together 
and i thank god for it because i've needed  

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.640
every one of you in the battles that i've walked 
through and i'm going to continue to walk through  

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:02.560
so i'm going to pray for us we'll get 
on praying let's stand again in this  

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.960
time of imitation ask the lord what he's 
speaking to you and respond lord jesus

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:15.840
god there's times where i'm reminded of the 
scripture in romans lord where i go to pray  

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.760
and maybe it just comes out as grumblings lord 
and i don't know what to pray but lord you do  

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:30.960
and you hear those things in my heart lord that 
you know i need forgiveness for or you know  

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.480
i need encouragement in and so lord today 
is just another one of those moments lord

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:44.640
we are nothing without you um and i'm 
reminded every day as i see your in your  

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.920
word that you love us that you want to 
have that personal relationship with us  

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.800
and you want to walk alongside us and that 
you've given us the church to do that and  

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.600
so lord i pray today that every person 
hears that message the message of hope  

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:01.760
i pray that every person leaves today more 
confident in their prayer life because they  

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.680
haven't complicated it anymore that they have 
simplified it that they have full access to you  

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:13.120
they have you and those around them to walk 
through this life and win the battles in  

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.160
their life so lord move in our hearts lord 
if there's someone that needs to give their  

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.920
life to you lord i pray that today they don't 
put it off that today is the day of salvation  

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:26.320
that they come and ask questions and lord 
that they make one more step to knowing you

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:35.840
lord we love you and we thank you again for this 
time and we pray this in your heavenly name amen
