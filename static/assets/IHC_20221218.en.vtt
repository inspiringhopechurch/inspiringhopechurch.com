00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.660
All right, we are ready to jump in.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.440
I know last week we got talking so
much, they put two timers on, plus

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.880
our intro video and, uh, today we
just did one timer in an intro video.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.690
Success.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.230
Right.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.920
Success.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.360
Um, but it, it is wonderful
to see you all again.

00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:24.390
I, I think I missed out on the memo when
I showed up and Matt and Amanda were in

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.870
these sweaters and I'm like, Hey, cool.

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:29.295
Anyways.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.945
Side note, side note.

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:32.564
Um, hey, Christmas is coming.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.715
Anybody excited, uh, for it to come?

00:00:35.715 --> 00:00:38.865
And if you're a parent that's been
buying gifts for your kids and

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:41.205
like rapping, are you almost there?

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:46.504
I mean, Britney's still shopping and
we'll wrap probably Saturday night.

00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:47.445
It's okay though.

00:00:47.504 --> 00:00:48.195
It'll be done.

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:49.125
It'll be done.

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:50.955
Um, so.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.380
Back to the message.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.090
Sorry, I'm just totally getting
sidetracked this morning.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.350
That's probably how today's gonna be.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.360
Um, so we have been walking through
the series talking about the names

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.560
of the coming Messiah, right?

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.120
So he shall be called.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.700
Um, and we are finally on the last
part of this, um, today, where we're

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:11.850
in Isaiah chapter nine and we've
been reading verses six and seven.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.800
We'll read those again
one more time today.

00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:17.205
But as we're coming to the end of the
series, there's a couple of things that

00:01:17.475 --> 00:01:20.805
I've just been thinking through is,
is my hope since week one that we've

00:01:20.805 --> 00:01:25.995
been walking through the series, is
that we have maybe kind of rekindled

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:28.665
this idea of the season of Christmas.

00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:32.565
Um, because again, I, I talk to enough
of you guys and enough people out,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.125
I ask, Hey, how's Christmas going?

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:35.515
And typically it's stress.

00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:40.155
Christmas is stressful because we have a
lot of gifts to buy and a, and a lot of

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:42.975
parties to attend and places to travel.

00:01:42.975 --> 00:01:44.985
And it's usually coming off
Thanksgiving where we did the same

00:01:44.985 --> 00:01:48.555
exact thing and, and this season
becomes like exciting at times, but

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:52.245
then stressful and then we get done
with it and it's like, oh, we move on.

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:58.275
And I, I think it's so important for
us to not miss just this idea that

00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:03.585
Jesus is the greatest gift we'll ever
receive, and he is somebody who is.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.320
Worshiping and praising and
celebrating all year long.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.680
So we're kind of just bringing that
idea back and we're learning more and

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.090
more about who Jesus is and this coming
Messiah that Isaiah was talking about,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.190
we've experienced, obviously he's came and
he's began to show up as these different

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.020
names that we've begin to see here.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.850
And these are the names I want
to kind of catch you up on it.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.910
Uh, the names that we have learned,
About the name of the coming.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.870
Messiah is wonderful counselor, mighty
God, an everlasting father, and so

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.920
I just kinda wanna break those down.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.580
So wonderful.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.880
Counselor, when we think about a wonderful
counselor, he is above anything we

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:41.500
could ever experience and he will walk
with us and help us and counsel us

00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:43.180
wherever we go in whatever we're doing.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.460
As mighty God, Jesus is stronger
and more powerful than anything else

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.230
that has ever been created or made.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.070
Jesus is above all and is all
knowing and control of everyth.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.030
And then last week we talked about
Everlasting father, and this is the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.870
part that I really focused on, is this
idea behind a everlasting father is

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.770
not meant to just be experienced in
eternity, but to be experienced now.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.980
Right?

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.770
So we don't have to wait for
eternity to start drawing on the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.170
inheritance of the kingdom of God.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.370
Um, his love, his mercy, his grace,
his forgiveness, his hope, his

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.210
wisdom, and the freedom that he
gives us to live and experience that.

00:03:18.915 --> 00:03:21.195
I mentioned this last week, and I think
I could mention it again this week.

00:03:21.195 --> 00:03:24.195
We could take those three names and
we could begin to just get to know

00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:27.075
Jesus more and more every day as a
wonderful counselor, a mighty God, and

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:31.845
an everlasting father, and that would be
enough because Jesus is amazing, right?

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.725
All the things in which he provides
and the things that He's done for

00:03:34.725 --> 00:03:38.295
us and and allows us to experience
this side of heaven through a

00:03:38.295 --> 00:03:40.245
relationship with him is amazing.

00:03:40.245 --> 00:03:42.705
Just in those three names
and ways that he relates to.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.630
But Isaiah didn't stop there and
he gave us one more name and he

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.970
gave us the name Prince of Peace.

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.260
Prince of Peace.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.140
And we're gonna walk through more
and more about what that means today

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.920
and kind of break that down, um, and,
and see some examples in the word and

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.450
also see some examples personally.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.740
But I, I wanted to start off this way.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.730
Typically, um, if you guys have
been around long enough, you're

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.270
starting to catch some of my trends.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.060
And if that is, you're starting to catch
those, I probably need to change them.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.930
Um, but usually I ask a question,
uh, whenever we start a message,

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.130
but I really wanna share a.

00:04:13.425 --> 00:04:17.954
This is a personal story about
how God, how Jesus has been

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.394
the prince of peace in my life.

00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:22.755
And I really wanna set it off this way
because I want you to begin thinking

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:25.935
this way today because you're gonna
get an opportunity to share how God has

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.035
been the prince of peace in your life.

00:04:28.365 --> 00:04:32.355
Um, I think testimonies are
so important, which means this

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:36.105
testimonies are what God's done in
your life, and you are called, you are

00:04:36.645 --> 00:04:37.755
challenged to share those testimonies.

00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:38.865
Don't keep 'em to yourself.

00:04:38.895 --> 00:04:41.320
And as we share them, Here's what I know.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.170
I'm encouraged when I hear
God working in your life.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.330
It reminds me of how good God.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.160
And so today I wanna share with
you to start off here of how

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.100
God has been the prince of peace
and mine and my family's life.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.480
So one of the cool parts, you guys know,
obviously we moved here to plant a church,

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.270
but there's a part of that that I've
shared multiple different times, but I

00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:01.170
wanna share it a little bit different.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:06.330
Today is in our journey of if 2019
when we were formally in Oklahoma,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.300
I was an executive pastor there and
we felt that God was calling us to

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.510
plant a church, but we didn't know.

00:05:11.325 --> 00:05:13.815
There was this season where, just
so you guys know, when we were

00:05:13.815 --> 00:05:17.085
at this former church, we'd been
there for seven years on staff.

00:05:17.355 --> 00:05:18.645
Uh, everything was going well.

00:05:18.645 --> 00:05:21.675
My pastor probably would've kept me
in that position as executive pastor

00:05:21.675 --> 00:05:24.945
for the rest of my life because he
was appreciative of my role there.

00:05:24.945 --> 00:05:28.905
We had so many friends, everything
was going great, but God put

00:05:28.905 --> 00:05:31.784
something on our hearts to begin
to pursue a call of church.

00:05:33.045 --> 00:05:36.405
I remember when we, uh, sensed it and
we started reaching out to the North

00:05:36.405 --> 00:05:39.015
American Mission Board, which is the
agency that we planted our church through.

00:05:39.315 --> 00:05:42.495
Um, and they said, Hey, pray about where
God's going, you know, to call you.

00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:45.225
And so we started praying and,
and we started praying over Ohio.

00:05:45.255 --> 00:05:49.065
And, um, so we started finding
Cincinnati and then Indianapolis.

00:05:49.335 --> 00:05:53.055
And so our family, um, me and Britney and
Sterling at that time was a young baby.

00:05:53.175 --> 00:05:56.935
We jumped on a plane and literally flew
out here to dispense some time in ci.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.680
Indianapolis.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.130
I remember getting on that plane
and, and again, this is like

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.420
everything's great back home.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.270
We're on the plane, we're flying back,
and she says, well, what do you think?

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.470
And this is what I said.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.620
I felt like God was telling me, he
says, you cannot stay where you are.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.240
You have to go plan a church.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.660
In that moment, we didn't
realize that statement.

00:06:16.155 --> 00:06:19.664
And how large that was and what we
were really committing ourselves to

00:06:20.085 --> 00:06:23.775
because we were gonna be moving 750
miles away from any family, any friends,

00:06:23.775 --> 00:06:25.484
and any connection to plant a church.

00:06:25.544 --> 00:06:28.935
And that moment was the moment
that we started experiencing the

00:06:28.935 --> 00:06:31.215
peace of God, the prince of peace.

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:34.724
Because when we got back and told
our pastor, when we start, when we

00:06:34.724 --> 00:06:36.465
got back and started telling our
church and our friends, you know what

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:37.995
they started saying, you're crazy.

00:06:39.044 --> 00:06:39.885
We couldn't do this.

00:06:39.885 --> 00:06:43.455
There's, there's no way we could
move that far away from our family.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.645
There's no way We started hearing
reasons why we shouldn't go, and we

00:06:48.645 --> 00:06:53.354
kept having this peace because God was
giving us peace that we were getting

00:06:53.354 --> 00:06:57.044
ready to, at that moment, leave a
church family that we absolutely loved.

00:06:57.044 --> 00:06:58.844
That was the church I
gave my life to Christ in.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:02.775
That was where I had made
so many amazing friends.

00:07:02.924 --> 00:07:05.835
That's where every one
of my family members is.

00:07:07.155 --> 00:07:07.844
Oh, he had peace.

00:07:08.354 --> 00:07:10.724
And I remember whenever we told
the church and we're like heading

00:07:10.724 --> 00:07:13.544
this direction, we're seven months
out from going to move here.

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:17.745
And we were like, Hey, wait, after seven
months we don't get paid from this church.

00:07:18.075 --> 00:07:20.025
How are we even gonna
have money to be here?

00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:22.455
We only know like a handful of people.

00:07:22.455 --> 00:07:24.255
And so we started praying
and we started seeking.

00:07:24.255 --> 00:07:25.784
But in the midst of
that, God gave us peace.

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:26.655
They was gonna provide that.

00:07:26.835 --> 00:07:28.054
Where are we gonna live when we get there?

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.599
We had just bought a
house nine months before.

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:32.040
How are we gonna sell that
thing without losing money?

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:35.820
There were so many things, guys,
to not have peace about that.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.070
Everybody is sitting there
asking the questions, well, what

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.760
are you gonna do about this?

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.750
Well, what are you gonna do about this?

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.440
And you know what?

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:41.760
We had peace.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.620
Now what I would say is this.

00:07:43.935 --> 00:07:45.135
Was it 100% of the time?

00:07:45.135 --> 00:07:45.255
No.

00:07:45.255 --> 00:07:49.665
There was moments of worry and then God
would remind us that he is the prince.

00:07:49.755 --> 00:07:50.355
A piece.

00:07:50.685 --> 00:07:53.775
And the cool part that I, of how I
believe that we could experience God

00:07:53.775 --> 00:07:55.995
in this season of when we were in 2019.

00:07:55.995 --> 00:07:57.495
I'll give you the short version, right?

00:07:57.645 --> 00:07:58.305
And all of that.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.045
God provided funding, selling our house.

00:08:00.045 --> 00:08:04.125
We passed assessment, we had
connections, we moved, showed up.

00:08:04.155 --> 00:08:06.075
God provided, and here's the cool part.

00:08:06.075 --> 00:08:08.565
We're three years in, we're
celebrating our three year anniversary

00:08:08.565 --> 00:08:09.945
of moving here in one week.

00:08:10.095 --> 00:08:12.465
We moved the day after Christmas, 2019.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.920
I would say this, just if you look
at statistics, church planting,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.310
uh, success rates can kind of vary,
but I would say we had a 50 50

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.600
shot of his church plan succeeding.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:21.930
I don't know.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.540
I think we may still be out there
on whether we are successful or not.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:24.810
Okay.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.430
Uh, but I think we are because you guys
are here and we are seeing, uh, we heard

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.860
a testimony this morning about how we're
making a difference in our community.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.170
Uh, and I believe that we're
continuing to see that.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.060
So I say that all, all to say.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.300
Why could our family experience the
Prince of Peace in a season of unknowns

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.330
in a season of all these things that
we had no clue was gonna happen?

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:45.990
You wanna know how?

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:52.170
Because we knew him as wonderful counselor
first, because we knew him as mighty God.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.800
First because we knew him
as everlasting father of our

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.040
eternity secured and our lives.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.840
Now, we were able to take steps of
faith because we knew God in that way.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.950
We knew Jesus in that.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.260
And I, I hope as we continue to
go through today, that as you are

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.950
living your life, that you can
experience the Prince of peace, even

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.780
whenever it's chaotic around you.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.850
And people will ask
you this question, why?

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.320
Cuz that's what people asked us.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.000
How could you do this?

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.080
And we kept pointing back to do,
do you understand that the God in

00:09:25.085 --> 00:09:27.660
which we serve and what he can do?

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.160
And, and, and my my hope is,
is, is as you experience.

00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:36.135
You'll wanna do more and more
for him to see him show up

00:09:36.555 --> 00:09:38.805
because he will, he will show up.

00:09:38.805 --> 00:09:40.635
And God has done amazing
things in this church.

00:09:40.635 --> 00:09:43.485
I've seen several of your lives
change because what God's done

00:09:43.485 --> 00:09:46.095
through this church, but I, I'm even
pointing this, I'm, I'm not trying

00:09:46.095 --> 00:09:48.735
to get ahead of myself guys, but in
a couple of weeks, we're gonna come

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.065
back here in the beginning of January
and we're gonna have a vision Sunday.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.835
And I'm gonna cast some awesome and
amazing vision that's gonna require faith.

00:09:58.275 --> 00:10:00.135
And, and just so you
know, it's not just my.

00:10:00.795 --> 00:10:03.285
This is the cool part in the
church that we came here to plant.

00:10:03.285 --> 00:10:04.695
We came with six people originally.

00:10:05.265 --> 00:10:07.125
It's all four of our
kids and me and Brittany.

00:10:07.245 --> 00:10:08.205
And it was our faith.

00:10:08.865 --> 00:10:12.195
And more and more people have joined
in and it's required y'all's faith.

00:10:12.435 --> 00:10:15.855
And I know that's a Oklahoma term
y'all, but I brought that here to Ohio.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:16.155
Okay.

00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:20.295
Y'all's faith as well to be a
part of experiencing the Prince of

00:10:20.295 --> 00:10:23.535
Peace, the mighty God, the wonderful
counselor of the everlasting father.

00:10:23.535 --> 00:10:25.215
And more and more and more.

00:10:25.755 --> 00:10:26.235
Amen.

00:10:26.355 --> 00:10:28.695
So let's jump in cuz I know
I haven't jumped in yet, so

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:29.685
don't, don't start clocking.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.650
Okay, don't start clocking me yet.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:38.370
So, um, let's jump in here and look at
and read this text and then we're gonna

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.880
talk about the setting a little bit,
cuz I know I sh I shared a little bit

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.230
of the setting in the last couple weeks.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.670
I don't wanna spend a ton of time on that.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.699
Um, but I want to jump into
a little bit of that and then

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.990
talk about the Prince of Peace.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.949
So the verses here again,
Isaiah chapter nine verses six.

00:10:53.775 --> 00:10:54.315
Seven.

00:10:54.315 --> 00:10:57.585
It says this, for a child will be
born for us, a son will be given

00:10:57.585 --> 00:11:02.475
to us and the government will be on
his shoulders and he will be named.

00:11:02.475 --> 00:11:03.405
Wonderful counselor.

00:11:03.405 --> 00:11:06.615
Mighty God, eternal father,
prince of peace and the dominion

00:11:06.615 --> 00:11:09.195
will be vast and its prosperity
will never end in his reign.

00:11:09.915 --> 00:11:13.665
On the throne of David and over his
kingdom to establish and sustain

00:11:13.665 --> 00:11:15.135
it with justice and righteousness.

00:11:15.285 --> 00:11:20.895
From now on and forever, the Z of the
Lord of the armies will accomplish this.

00:11:20.895 --> 00:11:21.375
Let's pray.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.915
Lord Jesus, we pray, Lord, as we dive
into your word and then dive into,

00:11:25.215 --> 00:11:27.615
uh, this name, Lord Prince of Peace.

00:11:27.705 --> 00:11:31.335
And as we dive into the testimonies that
we're gonna share in the examples in

00:11:31.335 --> 00:11:35.445
the Bible, Lord, I pray that we leave
out of here experiencing you in a.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.939
God, you desire for us to
know you in these ways.

00:11:38.939 --> 00:11:42.060
And I pray that we don't just know
it by knowledge, Lord, but we know

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.870
it by experience God, that you
transform our hearts and our lives

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:47.790
for your glory and for our good.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.870
And we pray this in your heaven name.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:49.680
Amen.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:56.160
So if I discussed in the past the setting,
right, the idea that Isaiah is a prophet

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.850
and his prophet prophesied about a coming
Messiah, but he's speaking to a group

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.680
of people known as God's people, right?

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.600
They were the the people of Israel.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.895
And now, Plainly speak here.

00:12:05.895 --> 00:12:07.545
So basically they split into two groups.

00:12:07.545 --> 00:12:09.045
It was Israel and then Judah.

00:12:09.465 --> 00:12:12.165
Uh, and he is speaking directly
to Judah, the tribe of Judah.

00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:14.175
And these people were
getting ready to be exiled.

00:12:14.445 --> 00:12:17.715
I don't know about you all, but again, I'm
gonna use that word I guess a lot today,

00:12:17.715 --> 00:12:22.575
but I if you were told today, Hey, you're
gonna have to leave your home and you're

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.085
gonna be taken away far from your land,
and you're gonna live in a foreign country

00:12:26.085 --> 00:12:32.655
under a foreign rule, uh, for at least 70
years, how excited would you be anybody?

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.860
I mean, you guys probably like your homes.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.210
Maybe some of you want
to give up your homes.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.620
You you're excited for the adventure.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.870
Most of these people were not excited.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.510
These were their homes
where they had grown up.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.160
They didn't wanna leave.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.810
But what had happened was the
people of Israel were not following

00:12:48.814 --> 00:12:49.710
God's will for their lives.

00:12:50.385 --> 00:12:51.975
They were following other gods.

00:12:51.975 --> 00:12:54.704
They were doing things for themselves
and because they were doing things

00:12:54.704 --> 00:12:59.175
for themselves, right, their own
ways, God was going to exile them to,

00:12:59.324 --> 00:13:01.125
to be able to draw them back to him.

00:13:01.245 --> 00:13:04.275
And so because they knew this was
coming and the prophet Isaiah knew

00:13:04.275 --> 00:13:09.824
this was coming, he is preparing them
to basically say, Hey, but you're

00:13:09.824 --> 00:13:12.885
not going to stay there forever, and
you're not gonna have to be in this

00:13:12.885 --> 00:13:14.265
condition of brokenness forever.

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:17.985
Isaiah begins to share that he's
sending this, that God is sending

00:13:17.985 --> 00:13:19.334
this coming Messiah, Jesus.

00:13:20.055 --> 00:13:21.584
I know we get to look
from this side of it.

00:13:21.584 --> 00:13:22.785
Jesus has already come.

00:13:23.025 --> 00:13:26.775
Jesus has saved us from our sins because
now we can give our lives to him and

00:13:26.834 --> 00:13:31.395
repent of our sins and trust in his
salvation and his payment for our sins.

00:13:31.724 --> 00:13:33.045
And we get to experience that now.

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:35.925
But they needed to experience
Jesus in these ways.

00:13:35.925 --> 00:13:37.454
That's why he began to share these names.

00:13:37.665 --> 00:13:41.175
And I would say, in this season of
our lives, we need to experience

00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:43.365
God in this way because.

00:13:44.205 --> 00:13:46.995
Because we are heading
into a season of unknowns.

00:13:46.995 --> 00:13:48.825
We are heading into a season of testing.

00:13:48.825 --> 00:13:51.285
You never know where you're
gonna need to cling to these

00:13:51.285 --> 00:13:53.595
names of God to relate with him.

00:13:53.655 --> 00:13:57.135
And so one of those was the peace
of God, the prince of peace, right?

00:13:57.285 --> 00:14:01.665
And we know this from Philippians four,
seven, that Jesus' peace surpasses all

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.835
understanding, just like what I shared.

00:14:04.395 --> 00:14:06.045
Earlier about our scenario.

00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:07.905
So let's jump in Prince a piece.

00:14:08.235 --> 00:14:09.135
What does it mean?

00:14:09.135 --> 00:14:11.415
So let's just break this down,
like we break it down every week.

00:14:11.655 --> 00:14:16.185
The word prince, as you begin to study
this prince, in context it means ruler or

00:14:16.185 --> 00:14:20.085
leader, and I love the name that that was
really described at the end of this, this,

00:14:20.115 --> 00:14:22.395
uh, definition, which was administrator.

00:14:23.385 --> 00:14:27.165
Then he says he's not only the
administrator, the prince of what.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.100
And one, the first definition as we begin
to look into this is you define peace in

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.840
this specific context, the first word that
came out was complete or completeness.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.699
I, I know that sounds like
weird, like peace is like no war,

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.949
like no internal strife, right?

00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:45.030
And there's part of that, right?

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:47.550
Safe, prosperous, quiet
freedom from disturbance.

00:14:47.555 --> 00:14:49.500
But the first word was completeness.

00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:54.569
And so I started thinking about this,
that, that Jesus administers peace to us.

00:14:55.275 --> 00:14:59.755
He administers completeness, which
means he is the one that completes

00:14:59.755 --> 00:15:04.125
us and fulfills us even when our
circumstances are dark and bleak.

00:15:04.515 --> 00:15:05.355
I love that thought.

00:15:05.355 --> 00:15:07.785
So let me just kind of summarize
this, the Prince of Peace.

00:15:07.965 --> 00:15:10.125
Jesus is our leader of peace.

00:15:10.305 --> 00:15:13.155
He controls it and provides
it or administers it.

00:15:13.635 --> 00:15:16.355
His peace is whole and complete.

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:19.305
We do not need to look
anywhere else to provide.

00:15:20.444 --> 00:15:26.204
His peace frees us from all the things
in our lives that try to take it from us.

00:15:26.655 --> 00:15:31.844
He is our source of peace, and it is time
for us to stop looking for other things

00:15:31.844 --> 00:15:33.435
and other people to fulfill that peace.

00:15:33.525 --> 00:15:36.854
If that's a challenge to you today,
I, I, I'm telling you, I, I, I

00:15:36.854 --> 00:15:38.204
hope you leave with that freedom.

00:15:38.775 --> 00:15:41.984
Don't look to other things to
provide the peace that Jesus

00:15:41.984 --> 00:15:43.454
gives as the prince of peace.

00:15:43.994 --> 00:15:45.015
So let me ask this question.

00:15:45.015 --> 00:15:46.395
What are some things in your life?

00:15:46.395 --> 00:15:47.775
What are some things in our lives?

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.270
That takes or tries to
take our peace from us.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:55.829
What are some things in your life,
our lives, the world's life that

00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:57.720
tries to take our peace from us?

00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:02.939
This is the time where you guys
can give some feedback, finances,

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.650
people, social media, work.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:09.699
Keep going.

00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:11.110
Sickness.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.430
Yes.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.610
Illness, money.

00:16:15.209 --> 00:16:15.930
Anything else you wanna throw out?

00:16:16.665 --> 00:16:18.165
Don't elbow the person next to you.

00:16:20.325 --> 00:16:21.345
I saw a couple of those.

00:16:22.755 --> 00:16:23.955
What about an unknown future?

00:16:24.615 --> 00:16:25.905
You ever wonder what's gonna happen?

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:27.915
Anybody who struggle
with a lack of control?

00:16:29.465 --> 00:16:29.995
I don't.

00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:37.785
, I, I would say this, y'all answered so
quickly because you know at times you

00:16:37.785 --> 00:16:39.015
struggle with peace in those areas.

00:16:39.675 --> 00:16:41.475
Maybe a wayward a child.

00:16:42.105 --> 00:16:44.085
May be an unknown job situation.

00:16:44.145 --> 00:16:49.635
May it mean a family conflict, or you
name it, we've all experienced it.

00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:51.645
Here is the cool part.

00:16:51.645 --> 00:16:52.755
This is the part that I love.

00:16:52.755 --> 00:16:55.635
I, I'm this person, again,
my background's in finance.

00:16:55.845 --> 00:16:56.475
I love that.

00:16:56.475 --> 00:16:57.435
Two plus two equals four.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.565
And if you tell me any
different, you're lying.

00:17:00.015 --> 00:17:01.305
But that makes sense to me.

00:17:02.415 --> 00:17:08.035
To me, if I don't have peace, you know
what two plus two equals for this situ.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.620
Jesus is the prince of peace.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.870
If I don't have peace, my answer
is Jesus who provides that peace

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.579
through a relationship with him.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.700
To consistently remind ourselves
of it, we have to have a

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.710
consistent relationship with Jesus.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:27.270
That's cool to me to know that
Jesus can be my prince of peace.

00:17:27.885 --> 00:17:29.085
I know where to go.

00:17:29.145 --> 00:17:32.535
I, I know that I don't go to my friends
just to complain to them, and I know I

00:17:32.535 --> 00:17:35.415
don't just go to my bank to try to get
a loan and I know I just don't go to

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.505
my work to try to get them to figure it
out, even though those are places where

00:17:38.505 --> 00:17:41.655
God will guide and direct you to do as
you need to do to provide that peace.

00:17:41.835 --> 00:17:45.165
But he, despite what you're
going through, can and will.

00:17:45.225 --> 00:17:46.515
But how do we experience that?

00:17:46.695 --> 00:17:47.655
How do we experience it?

00:17:47.865 --> 00:17:51.225
We have to remember this, and this
is a statement I want you to, to,

00:17:51.225 --> 00:17:53.265
to keep with you and walk with you.

00:17:53.535 --> 00:17:56.505
Peace is not an absence of struggle.

00:17:57.135 --> 00:18:01.275
Or trials in your life, but the
presence of God in the midst of them.

00:18:01.275 --> 00:18:02.175
I wanna say this again.

00:18:02.715 --> 00:18:07.425
Peace is not the absence of struggles
or trials or difficulties, but the

00:18:07.905 --> 00:18:10.845
presence of God in the midst to
them Guys, no matter if you are

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.905
a believer in Christ or not, you
will have trials and difficulties.

00:18:14.025 --> 00:18:15.045
Here's the cool part.

00:18:15.105 --> 00:18:19.095
When you give your life to Christ,
he is there with you in the midst of.

00:18:20.565 --> 00:18:22.845
And you'll be amazed as you
begin to pursue that relationship

00:18:22.845 --> 00:18:26.805
with Jesus, how you can live
different than the world does.

00:18:26.865 --> 00:18:32.445
The world stresses and is
anxious and is overwhelmed.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.485
And here's the thing, even as
Christ followers, at times we

00:18:34.485 --> 00:18:37.965
do too because we forget to
remember that Jesus is our peace.

00:18:38.265 --> 00:18:39.495
He is our prince of peace.

00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:45.705
But as we continue to focus on our
relationship with Jesus, We know that

00:18:45.705 --> 00:18:47.655
he will provide that peace that we need.

00:18:47.865 --> 00:18:50.865
So peace is found where
the presence of God is.

00:18:51.075 --> 00:18:54.345
And without a right relationship
with Jesus, we won't find that peace.

00:18:54.345 --> 00:18:55.215
I'm gonna say that again.

00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:58.785
Peace is found where
the presence of God is.

00:18:59.115 --> 00:19:02.385
And without the right relationship
with Jesus, we won't find that peace.

00:19:03.825 --> 00:19:06.375
I know this sounds crazy, but.

00:19:07.155 --> 00:19:08.325
We do have a part in it.

00:19:08.415 --> 00:19:11.865
And that part is, is Jesus is always
there, ready to provide that peace.

00:19:12.105 --> 00:19:15.405
It's whether we're willing to pursue
him, to find it, whether we're willing

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:19.185
to consistently get into God's Word
and begin to consistently be, and

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.955
this is where I wanna challenge
you with those prayer cards.

00:19:21.075 --> 00:19:25.425
Be vulnerable to ask for prayer and
support, to be vulnerable, to be willing

00:19:26.264 --> 00:19:30.885
to surrender your life to Jesus and be
willing to take up what he has given

00:19:30.885 --> 00:19:32.475
us through relationship with him.

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:35.085
I know that that is difficult at times.

00:19:35.085 --> 00:19:36.165
I underst.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.500
But knowing Jesus as a prince of peace
means that we can trust his plan,

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.180
whether we know the details or not.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.010
And so Thaddeus Williams said this.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:48.390
He says, happiness and security
don't come from knowing everything,

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.420
but knowing the one who does.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.230
And then he goes on to say
this, if we don't believe in an

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.500
omniscient God, which is basically
this, an all-knowing God, right?

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.390
We'll overestimate our own wisdom
and try to become an all-knowing.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.199
And that's a recipe for
foolishness and despair.

00:20:08.729 --> 00:20:11.101
And I remember this, and this is something
that challenged me as beginning to think

00:20:11.106 --> 00:20:12.570
through in the storms of life here.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.989
Here's the thing, when you have kids,
your kids know when there's difficulties

00:20:15.995 --> 00:20:18.060
going on in your life, they watch you.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:22.500
And one of those examples is, and you
guys may have kids or not, but maybe

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.409
have animals, your animals do the same
thing when there's a storm outside.

00:20:25.409 --> 00:20:26.189
Do they, do they get.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.440
I know your animals do.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.290
I've, I've heard some of them, but
even my kids do, my, my kids kind

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.690
of get nervous when it's raining
and, and the wind's blowing.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:34.860
And, and what do they do?

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.660
They're looking usually to you.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.820
Is it okay?

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.170
Is everything gonna be okay?

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.550
And we have to remind our kids this.

00:20:41.555 --> 00:20:44.310
During the storms, we say, Hey, trust us.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.250
When we start freaking out, you can
start freaking out, but if we're

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.390
not freaking out, you're good.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.300
And it seems like it calms our
kids down, like just trust.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.780
Can I step out there a little bit?

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.870
When we look at this idea behind the
storms in our life and the things

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:01.230
that are going on around us, our
Heavenly Father, the Prince of Peace,

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.520
knows what we need, knows what we
need, and what we're going through.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.660
And here's what he's telling you.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.300
In the midst of this, he's
telling you not to worry.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.620
He'll take care of it.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.240
And here's what he's telling you.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.640
Until I freak out, you don't freak out.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.110
And here's the cool part.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:20.160
God doesn't freak out, and so
we have to keep going back to.

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.660
And I was challenged by this statement
as I was, I was, uh, talking to my

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.250
wife, Brittany, about something.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.280
I don't remember how we got talking about
this, but it was this idea behind worry.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.790
And I've heard this statement
multiple times, what we worry

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:37.050
about the most, we trust God in the
least, what we worry about the most.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.100
We trust God in the least.

00:21:39.405 --> 00:21:42.315
And it's kind of funny because it's the
moments that I start remembering these

00:21:42.315 --> 00:21:45.015
things and it's like I, I'm coming up
here to like, share with you guys and

00:21:45.015 --> 00:21:49.155
I'm like, man, there's been some moments
recently where I've had some major worry

00:21:49.425 --> 00:21:52.185
and then I'm convicted and I'm like, man,
that's where I'm trusting God the least.

00:21:52.365 --> 00:21:53.145
And you know what I did?

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.325
In the midst of that, I went back to
God and I said, okay, God, uh, this

00:21:56.325 --> 00:22:00.405
financial situation, this health
situation, this car trouble situation,

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:03.015
this relationship situation, whatever it.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.590
Is yours.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.400
Here's the cool part.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.440
My pastor used to remind me
this when I was in Oklahoma.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:12.810
Um, if everything you have is God's,
when it's broke, he's gotta fix it.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.860
I mean, if you have a vehicle
and it's yours, you have to

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:17.910
fix it if it's broke, right?

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.800
But if everything you have is given to
the Lord, then when it's broke, when it's

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.080
difficult, you just say, Lord, it's yours.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:26.730
It's your wayward child.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.320
It's your relationship issue.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.190
You fix.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:30.540
What do you have to do?

00:22:30.545 --> 00:22:33.360
It's not a one-time, Hey, surrender
that situation to the Lord.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.960
It's a daily decision to
commit that to the Lord.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.730
So why did Isaiah leave the
prince of peace to the last part?

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.610
I believe it's probably the
one that most of us need.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.460
Does anybody need peace?

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.050
More peace than life over situations?

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:50.610
Yes.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.280
I think some of you didn't raise your
hands cuz you just don't want to,

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.610
you don't have peace about raising
your hands that, that's nervous.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.510
That's a struggle.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:58.020
I get it.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:58.530
Okay.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:58.740
I.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.850
So I, I, I, we talked
about the prince piece.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.720
We, we kind of set this thing up and
I want quickly transition into this.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:07.920
Here's what I know.

00:23:07.925 --> 00:23:09.960
And, and, and, and the more I started
thinking about this message, I could

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.110
continue to just dive deeper, but
I, I wanna just take a step back.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.370
I have learned, and I feel like
in my short life of faith, right?

00:23:17.375 --> 00:23:21.180
I think I've only been safe now for
about 12 years in my short life of faith.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.480
I believe that I have grown more
in my knowledge and understanding

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.620
of God by seeing and hearing
testimonies of other people's.

00:23:29.985 --> 00:23:32.205
We're gonna take a little bit of time
and we're gonna read through a couple

00:23:32.205 --> 00:23:35.325
of scriptures, a couple of different
stories in the Bible, uh, in the

00:23:35.325 --> 00:23:40.695
gospels of how Jesus was the prince of
peace in two different circumstances.

00:23:40.695 --> 00:23:41.385
Here's the cool part.

00:23:41.385 --> 00:23:43.785
If you, you wanna know how
Jesus was the prince of peace?

00:23:43.875 --> 00:23:48.135
Go read all the gospels and you'll see how
he was multiple times for multiple people.

00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:50.835
But I'm choosing two specific
stories to walk through today as

00:23:50.835 --> 00:23:53.985
a church to see how he was the
prince of peace in these situations.

00:23:54.285 --> 00:23:58.585
And then I'm gonna give
you some time to share a t.

00:23:59.265 --> 00:24:02.835
Of how Jesus was the prince of
peace and a situation for you.

00:24:02.835 --> 00:24:03.795
And here's what I know.

00:24:04.605 --> 00:24:08.985
Early on in my faith, I had to clean
to the testimonies of other people.

00:24:08.985 --> 00:24:10.395
Cause I hadn't experienced
God in that way.

00:24:11.175 --> 00:24:16.125
So I remember early on in my faith
when my family was young and broke,

00:24:16.545 --> 00:24:21.105
and I think I'm old now and broke,
but young and broke, I struggled.

00:24:21.105 --> 00:24:23.475
And we would talk to people and
they would share stories of how God.

00:24:24.975 --> 00:24:25.665
Are you serious?

00:24:25.665 --> 00:24:26.775
Like he did in that way?

00:24:26.835 --> 00:24:28.605
And you all know, you ever
hear somebody share a story

00:24:28.605 --> 00:24:29.895
and you're like, yeah, right.

00:24:30.075 --> 00:24:31.335
Yeah, that's a fake.

00:24:32.175 --> 00:24:35.865
But then we started just believing,
okay, Lord, we believe you in this area.

00:24:35.955 --> 00:24:36.885
We believe you in this area.

00:24:37.004 --> 00:24:39.225
And then God would show up.

00:24:40.155 --> 00:24:42.975
And then now we have a testimony,
and then now we're in a group

00:24:42.975 --> 00:24:45.585
usually, and we would share that
with them and they would go no way.

00:24:45.585 --> 00:24:48.075
Like, man, I've been God, I'm
gonna pray for God to show up.

00:24:48.195 --> 00:24:51.615
And then God would show up again and God
would show up again and God would show up.

00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:56.325
This is why it's so cool to be able
to share testimonies, but if you

00:24:56.325 --> 00:24:57.945
don't have one today, that's fine.

00:24:58.095 --> 00:25:00.555
I'm praying that you cling to the
ones that I've shared, the ones that

00:25:00.555 --> 00:25:03.075
we'll learn in the Bible, and then
some of the ones that others share.

00:25:03.525 --> 00:25:04.365
So that's really cool.

00:25:04.365 --> 00:25:06.525
I think it's cool that we're gonna
get an opportunity to do that.

00:25:06.555 --> 00:25:07.935
Okay, so let's do this.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.675
If you have your Bibles with
you, if you don't, we're gonna

00:25:09.675 --> 00:25:10.455
have it up on the screen.

00:25:10.695 --> 00:25:15.675
We're gonna turn to John chapter two, and
we're gonna read verses one through 11.

00:25:16.005 --> 00:25:19.335
And, uh, this is the part I probably
should have even offered like a mic.

00:25:19.755 --> 00:25:23.400
Uh, Jason, if I throw a mic out
to somebody and let them speak

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.420
into a mic, they could do that.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:24.960
Let's do that.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.960
I'm asking somebody to read this,
and before you read it, you're gonna

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.310
think I'm crazy why we're reading it.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:33.570
So, does anybody wanna read, uh, John
chapter two, verse one through 11?

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.360
Anybody I, I know a lot of y'all are.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.960
Here we go.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.530
Awesome Megan.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:37.980
Thanks.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:42.550
All right.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:43.530
Go ahead and read.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.040
On the third day a wedding
took place in Canna of Galilee.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.730
Jesus' mother was there and
Jesus and his disciples were

00:25:50.735 --> 00:25:52.080
invited to the wedding as well.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.730
When the wine ran out, Jesus's mother
told him they don't have any wine.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.090
What has this concern
of yours to do with me?

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.370
Woman Jesus asked My hour has not yet.

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:04.755
Do whatever he tells you.

00:26:04.755 --> 00:26:09.705
His mother told the servants, now,
six stone water jars had been set

00:26:09.735 --> 00:26:11.625
there for Jewish purification.

00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:15.795
Each contained 20 or 30 gallons
fill the jars with water.

00:26:15.795 --> 00:26:18.645
Jesus told them, so they
filled them to be to the brim.

00:26:19.035 --> 00:26:22.005
Then he asked to them, now
draw some out and take it to

00:26:22.005 --> 00:26:23.685
the head waiter, and they did.

00:26:24.645 --> 00:26:27.855
When the head waiter tasted the
water after it had become wine,

00:26:27.915 --> 00:26:29.505
he did not know where it came.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.620
Though the servants who had drawn the
water knew he called the grim and told

00:26:34.625 --> 00:26:41.100
him, everyone sets out the fine wine first
then after people are drunk, the inferior.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.800
But you have kept the fine wine until now.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.300
Jesus did this, the first of
his signs in Can of Galilee.

00:26:48.419 --> 00:26:51.510
He revealed his glory and his
disciples believed in him.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.620
Thank you, Megan.

00:26:53.129 --> 00:26:55.139
So you're gonna say, what the heck?

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.030
Like how does this relate
to the Prince of peace?

00:26:57.034 --> 00:26:58.740
There's a reason why I chose this.

00:26:59.865 --> 00:27:04.754
Um, y'all may not think that's
important, you know, just turning and

00:27:04.754 --> 00:27:06.525
wine into a water for a wedding party.

00:27:06.764 --> 00:27:08.205
But let's, let's think a little bit here.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.725
I'm just not gonna, I'm not gonna
take an hour to, to mill this up,

00:27:10.725 --> 00:27:11.595
but I wanna think just a little bit.

00:27:12.225 --> 00:27:19.335
Jesus' mother knew how important it was
for the wedding party to provide what

00:27:19.335 --> 00:27:22.635
was needed for the wedding, and if they
did not provide for it, they ran out.

00:27:22.665 --> 00:27:23.895
It would be an embarrassment for that.

00:27:25.545 --> 00:27:28.755
So even in that small thing where it was
just of me an embarrassment for a family,

00:27:29.205 --> 00:27:33.495
Jesus was their peace because here's
the thing, they were freaking out now.

00:27:33.555 --> 00:27:34.185
Now it's cool.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.935
Here's the cool part.

00:27:35.115 --> 00:27:39.615
Jesus' mother wasn't because she knew
who Jesus was, but the rest of the

00:27:39.615 --> 00:27:40.815
party's like, what are we gonna do?

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.685
They're freaking out.

00:27:41.805 --> 00:27:43.155
They're not at peace.

00:27:43.365 --> 00:27:46.815
In a small situation, this is again,
not life or death, this just sit

00:27:46.815 --> 00:27:48.375
in the small circumstances of life.

00:27:48.855 --> 00:27:50.085
And Jesus showed.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.490
Now again, you're thinking
what, what's crazy about this?

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.180
I, I, I want you to hear these stories
because I want you to know this.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.450
In the small things,
Jesus can be your peace.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.860
I remember early on in my faith when
I was outside changing a light bob

00:28:04.865 --> 00:28:08.190
for my car, my headlight, and so you
guys know, if you don't know me really

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.700
well, I'm not good at working on
cars even when it comes to headlamps.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:12.270
Okay?

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.500
And I probably didn't even say that.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.190
But I'm a man and he
changes his own lights.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.270
This is what I'm supposed to do.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.389
I get out there guys and I don't
know what I'm doing, and I get

00:28:21.389 --> 00:28:23.639
it open and get the light bulb
out, but I can't get it back in.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.070
I don't, and I'm, what do I do?

00:28:26.129 --> 00:28:30.990
It's night and I gotta get this changed,
and I stopped early on my faith.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:33.899
I'm like, okay, Lord, it's a
light bulb, but I need help.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.980
I went back over and I put the
light bulb in and it worked.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:40.350
I'm just telling you I don't
know why, and I laughed.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.659
I remember going and telling Brittany,
even in the small things, God hear.

00:28:43.485 --> 00:28:45.645
Even in the small things, God
wanted to be my peace cuz I was

00:28:45.645 --> 00:28:48.675
freaking out in that moment cuz I
had my man card on the line, right?

00:28:49.035 --> 00:28:49.905
I was freaking out.

00:28:50.655 --> 00:28:51.555
But God showed up.

00:28:51.645 --> 00:28:55.995
I shared that story cuz I want you to
know even sometimes in the small details,

00:28:56.325 --> 00:28:58.005
Jesus can be your prince of peace.

00:28:58.005 --> 00:28:59.295
So let's read this second one.

00:28:59.595 --> 00:29:02.115
I need somebody to read
in Mark chapter nine.

00:29:02.655 --> 00:29:05.085
Mark chapter nine, verses 14 through 27.

00:29:06.075 --> 00:29:09.765
This is up on the screen and
um, who wants to read this one?

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.285
Mark, chapter nine verses 14 through 20.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:13.500
Anybody.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.760
I know I got at least one person
in here that loves reading

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.580
somebody even up on the screen.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.640
All right.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:23.880
What?

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.030
What?

00:29:24.035 --> 00:29:24.600
Oh, here we go.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.200
Brian's doing it.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:25.950
I'm going to Brian.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:27.000
Thanks Brian.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.020
When they came to the disciples,
they saw a large crowd around them

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.240
and scribes disputing with them.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.790
When the whole crowd saw him,
they were amazed and ran to greet.

00:29:40.365 --> 00:29:43.035
He asks them, what are you
arguing with them about?

00:29:43.395 --> 00:29:44.895
Someone from the crowd answered him.

00:29:45.315 --> 00:29:47.805
Teacher, I brought my son to you.

00:29:47.865 --> 00:29:50.295
He has a spirit that
makes him unable to speak.

00:29:50.715 --> 00:29:54.195
Whenever it seizes him, it throws
him down and he foams at the mouth,

00:29:54.225 --> 00:29:56.265
grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid.

00:29:57.105 --> 00:30:00.555
I ask your disciples to drive
it out, but they couldn't here.

00:30:00.555 --> 00:30:03.765
PI replied to them, you
unbelieving generation.

00:30:03.855 --> 00:30:05.265
How long will I be with you?

00:30:05.535 --> 00:30:06.825
How long must I put up with?

00:30:07.514 --> 00:30:08.325
Bring him to me.

00:30:09.254 --> 00:30:10.514
So they brought the boy to him.

00:30:10.935 --> 00:30:14.475
When the spirit saw him, it immediately
threw the boy into convulsions.

00:30:14.565 --> 00:30:17.235
He fell to the ground, rolled
around, foaming at the mouth.

00:30:17.985 --> 00:30:19.455
How long has this been happening to him?

00:30:19.485 --> 00:30:24.405
Jesus asked the father from childhood,
he said, and many times it has thrown

00:30:24.405 --> 00:30:26.625
him into fire or water to destroy him.

00:30:26.805 --> 00:30:31.155
But if you can do anything, have
compassion on us and help us, Jesus said

00:30:31.155 --> 00:30:36.990
to him, if you can, Everything is possible
for the one who believes immediately.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.830
The father of the boy cried out,
I do believe, helped my unbelief.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:45.660
When Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly
gathering, he rebuked the unclean spirit

00:30:45.665 --> 00:30:48.210
saying to it, you mute and death spirit.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.050
I command you.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.210
Come out of him and never enter him again.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.320
Then it came out shrieking and
throwing him into terrible convulsions.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:00.510
The boy became like a corpse, so that
many said he's dead, but Jesus taking

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.490
him by the hand released him and stood.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:04.710
Awesome.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.940
Thank you for reading that.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.139
So could have chose a
lot of different stories.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.889
Um, and honestly, if you want some
more, just go start reading through

00:31:13.895 --> 00:31:15.310
the gospels and you'll find 'em.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.600
There's a reason why I chose that
story, because there's a part in

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:23.040
here where the father says, um,
I do believe, help my unbelief.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.250
Um, let, let me just kind of
describe a couple things here.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:29.100
Number one, the disciples
who were spiritual people.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.860
Couldn't bring peace to
the father of the boy.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.540
Only Jesus could.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.370
Um, the father was seeking peace and
Jesus was the only one to provide it.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.460
And he says, I do
believe, help my unbelief.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:41.909
Right?

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.970
I'll just tell you this, in
some of the circumstances of

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:46.649
life, this one's a unique one.

00:31:46.649 --> 00:31:50.970
Again, I'm not diving into the context of
this and how this boy was, uh, possessed

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:52.050
in how things were happening there.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:55.050
I, what I wanna focus on is there
was a desperate need because this

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:58.590
boy was sick and he was not right.

00:31:59.159 --> 00:32:00.750
His father was desperate.

00:32:01.199 --> 00:32:02.970
Has anybody ever been
desperate for the Lord to move?

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:10.379
And, and here in the midst of asking
and desperation, I've been there and,

00:32:10.379 --> 00:32:13.980
you know, a lot of times what I've had
to do because it's difficult, is I've

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.949
had to say this, Lord, help my unbelief.

00:32:16.955 --> 00:32:20.280
I do believe, I do believe you
can move in this circumstance.

00:32:20.429 --> 00:32:24.300
This situation helped my unbelief
and, and I, I wish I could

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.290
tell you that at the moment.

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:28.409
I said that the next moment,
everything was perfect.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.660
Because sometimes it takes weeks
and months for us to see how

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.890
God is providing that peace.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.340
Sometimes it takes years and it takes
reflection to see what God does, and

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.660
sometimes God does it immediately.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.880
I've experienced both sides of that.

00:32:42.985 --> 00:32:47.475
I, I, I want you guys to see these
examples because I want you to see that at

00:32:47.475 --> 00:32:51.075
times it's the simple things in which we
need peace as sometimes it's the difficult

00:32:51.075 --> 00:32:53.325
things and we struggle to believe.

00:32:53.325 --> 00:32:57.345
Even your pastor struggles to believe,
okay, it's okay at times to do that

00:32:57.855 --> 00:33:01.785
because we forget how good God is.

00:33:01.785 --> 00:33:05.445
We forget that God moves in mighty
ways, just like we read in his word,

00:33:05.595 --> 00:33:07.095
and just like we've heard in our lives.

00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:09.585
I remember just even thinking about this.

00:33:10.185 --> 00:33:13.875
As early as this year, I
struggle with believing that God

00:33:13.875 --> 00:33:15.195
could do something miraculous.

00:33:15.195 --> 00:33:17.025
And again, I'm gonna go back to
a life circumstance and we're

00:33:17.025 --> 00:33:17.985
gonna jump into your lives.

00:33:18.585 --> 00:33:21.975
Um, most of you that have been around
for a while would know that we built a

00:33:21.975 --> 00:33:25.935
home on the west side of Hamilton, uh,
and we signed the contract in November of

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.355
like 2021 when interest rates were low.

00:33:29.865 --> 00:33:30.795
Everything was great.

00:33:31.125 --> 00:33:33.345
Um, everything was great then, right?

00:33:33.435 --> 00:33:36.165
And then everything started going
up, interest rates, construction

00:33:36.165 --> 00:33:37.245
costs started going up.

00:33:37.455 --> 00:33:39.435
And in the midst of it, I
couldn't lock in our interest.

00:33:40.215 --> 00:33:42.014
I started freaking out
cause I'm a finance guy.

00:33:42.014 --> 00:33:43.725
I'm controlling, wouldn't believe it.

00:33:43.725 --> 00:33:46.004
I'm controlling and I'm getting mad.

00:33:46.545 --> 00:33:47.355
I mean mad.

00:33:48.465 --> 00:33:51.285
And my wife's always the civil person
of like, well, God's gonna take

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.425
care of it and it's gonna be fine.

00:33:53.205 --> 00:33:56.385
And I actually had to hear the story of
another church planner who was dealing

00:33:56.385 --> 00:34:00.075
with the housing situation and he shared
with me how God showed up in his life.

00:34:01.004 --> 00:34:03.345
And I just said, you know
what, Lord, if you can do it

00:34:03.345 --> 00:34:05.535
for him, you can do it for us.

00:34:06.764 --> 00:34:07.995
Help me believe cuz I don't see.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:09.779
Help me believe.

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:13.049
And before it was all said and done,
our construction costs never went up.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.480
We didn't have to pay anymore, and
we were able to get an interest

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.630
rate almost at the rate that we
started with back in November.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:24.989
I don't know how, I'm just telling you,
I don't know how, because I was freaking

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:28.920
out, but I kept saying over and over
again, I believe, Help my unbelief.

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:32.280
I, you may think it's crazy, it's
a house, but I do believe this,

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.370
our house we knew was going to
be a ministry in our community.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.990
It was gonna get us
closer to our community.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:40.590
It's gonna allow us to invest and be
able to do the things we're doing.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:44.370
Like we, we see that
everything we have is god's.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.280
That's just a testimony again of, I
believe God showed up in our lives.

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:48.390
That's for us.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.540
But I would love to take just
a few minutes, a few minutes.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.100
For you to start sharing and
we'll have two to three people.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.640
We may have more time for more to start
sharing how God has moved in your life,

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.360
how God has been the prince of peace for
you, so that maybe you can encourage us.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.940
But I wanna leave you with this
statement before you share.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:08.910
There's some that sought Jesus
that didn't leave with peace.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:13.650
If you'll remember Nicodemus who met
with Jesus, he didn't leave with peace.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:18.150
And if you remember the rich young ruler
who says, Hey, I've done all these things.

00:35:18.915 --> 00:35:19.634
What should I do?

00:35:19.634 --> 00:35:22.185
And he says, go sell all your
possessions and come follow me.

00:35:22.365 --> 00:35:23.745
And he left away sad.

00:35:24.165 --> 00:35:25.035
He did not have peace.

00:35:25.185 --> 00:35:28.875
Some of us come to Jesus and we
don't receive the peace he gives us.

00:35:29.984 --> 00:35:34.035
But for you, how has God been
the prince of peace for you?

00:35:34.035 --> 00:35:35.654
So who wants to share?

00:35:36.075 --> 00:35:38.355
I'm gonna pass around to Mike and
I'm hoping I get at least two or

00:35:38.355 --> 00:35:40.065
three of y'all who wants to share.

00:35:40.214 --> 00:35:41.145
Oh, Amanda's up.

00:35:41.384 --> 00:35:41.805
Here we go.

00:35:43.655 --> 00:35:47.925
So a lot of you know my story, um, but a
part of the story that you may not know.

00:35:47.985 --> 00:35:52.275
Um, so I had a, a miscarriage in
early December, 2020, got pregnant

00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:55.875
again right away and was praying
and just, you know, that fear if

00:35:55.875 --> 00:35:57.045
anyone's had a pregnancy loss.

00:35:57.045 --> 00:35:59.865
The fear of pregnancy again after
that is really overwhelming and I

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.925
was just praying for peace and I
was praying for God to just settle

00:36:02.925 --> 00:36:04.455
my heart and I heard him speak.

00:36:04.455 --> 00:36:05.835
You're going to lose this one in.

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:09.120
and I started crying.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.400
Matt came downstairs and
I was a sobbing mess.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.420
And I was like, I don't know why.

00:36:12.509 --> 00:36:14.220
I don't know what God's
doing in this moment.

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:16.380
Um, but I feel like I'm
gonna lose this baby.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.570
And so let's just, let's just
pray for peace right now.

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.820
Um, we did end up losing the baby.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.300
Uh, it was a long, drawn out process,
lots of complications, took forever.

00:36:24.305 --> 00:36:25.230
I kept praying for mercy.

00:36:25.259 --> 00:36:27.330
I was like, God, just, I get it.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:27.690
I get that.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:29.460
I have to go through this,
but just let's move on.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:29.730
Right.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.710
Um, about four weeks later was
when I found out that I had breast.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.180
and it was because of the pregnancy.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.110
Um, and so I was praying
that again that night.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.400
Um, when I found out that I had the
tumor, um, and I was thanking God, I

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.000
was like, thank you for this angel baby,
because this baby is what saved my life.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:50.610
This is what, this is what
is gonna give me a future.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.400
And um, I heard God speak the name Josiah.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.320
And I was like, okay, that's really weird.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.110
Like no desire to name the
angel baby wasn't a thing.

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:01.110
I looked it up and it
means God saves in Hebrew.

00:37:02.395 --> 00:37:07.320
. Um, and so when it comes to, you know,
I was talking to somebody a few weeks

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.800
ago about like, well, how do you, how do
you have faith in difficult situations?

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.120
How do you maintain your faith?

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.940
Um, and the answer is by going
through difficult situations

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.590
and by seeing God come through.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:21.060
Um, and so the only way, the only
reason that we've had any peace through

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.540
any of this journey, um, is because
of all the things and all the ways

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.660
that God has showed up for us in every
step of the way leading up to it.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.430
Um, so just wanna encourage you in that.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:30.120
Amen.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.930
Thank you so much for,

00:37:34.125 --> 00:37:35.084
Anybody else wanna share?

00:37:35.714 --> 00:37:39.615
How has God been the prince of peace
for you, even in small circumstance?

00:37:39.615 --> 00:37:42.254
I love hearing every one
of them who wants to share.

00:37:48.495 --> 00:37:48.975
Come on.

00:37:49.365 --> 00:37:50.384
I know there's a couple other people.

00:37:50.384 --> 00:37:51.375
You're just afraid to talk.

00:37:53.384 --> 00:37:54.194
Oh yeah.

00:37:54.404 --> 00:37:54.915
Here we go.

00:37:55.125 --> 00:37:56.654
Sorry, I wasn't looking far enough left.

00:37:59.174 --> 00:38:00.915
Um, I hate talking on microphones.

00:38:01.335 --> 00:38:04.545
So thank you for being a leader in this.

00:38:04.995 --> 00:38:06.674
Um, so.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:13.080
Last, this past summer, um, Doug
and I, uh, our, our main car broke.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:17.070
We have like an old, old granny car that
still worked, but our main car broke and

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:21.630
it really sucked and we had a really hard
time getting around and getting a new

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.280
car and it just wasn't in the budget.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:27.240
Um, and I was in discipleship group
with Britney and some other ladies.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:33.030
Um, and our memory verse that week
I'm gonna read it was, um, acts 1724.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.700
He is the God who made
the world and everything.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.510
Since he is the Lord of heaven and
earth, he doesn't live in manmade

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:43.620
temples and human hands can't serve
his needs for, he has no needs.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:48.480
He himself gives life and breath to
everything, and he satisfies every need.

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.660
And so I just, I memorized that verse.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.410
That was our verse of the week.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:56.040
But I clung to it and I still
clinging to it when I have struggles

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.780
with peace and anxiety over things.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:59.680
Um, the Lord really.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.750
Like allowed me for the first
time to like, give that to him.

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:06.900
And I really just believed like he was
gonna provide and he was gonna do it.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.690
And it, like you said, if it's
his car, then he's the one

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.010
that has to buy us a new car.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:15.000
So, and then he did , , um,
the church gave us.

00:39:16.134 --> 00:39:17.955
A very generous gift.

00:39:17.984 --> 00:39:21.075
Um, and we were able to put a down
payment on a new car, and it was just

00:39:21.075 --> 00:39:22.875
the biggest blessing that we've ever had.

00:39:22.875 --> 00:39:27.524
And like the hugest like miracle that
like the Lord provided in such a huge way.

00:39:28.035 --> 00:39:29.384
Um, yeah.

00:39:29.924 --> 00:39:30.674
So Cool.

00:39:30.765 --> 00:39:31.845
Thank you so much for sharing.

00:39:36.645 --> 00:39:37.694
All right, one more person.

00:39:38.274 --> 00:39:39.254
I'm trying to get to three.

00:39:39.285 --> 00:39:40.334
One more person wanna share how.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.290
God has been the prince of peace for you.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.030
Yes.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.450
Awesome.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:45.900
Thank you.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.160
It's okay.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:48.960
Lisa, thank you for setting that example.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.190
So now we got more people sharing.

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:54.960
Um, so I was pregnant with Isaac,
um, and Josh had this crazy idea

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.800
that he wanted to move out to land
and I was like, okay, I'm on board.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:00.630
We started like looking at houses.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.670
We had found one, we lost it at the time.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.730
We were like both kind of upset
about it and then we found.

00:40:06.484 --> 00:40:09.645
, the house that we were currently in,
but then we actually lost that one.

00:40:09.645 --> 00:40:12.165
Like somebody had like outbid
us and so our realtors like,

00:40:12.165 --> 00:40:13.245
yeah, you don't have it.

00:40:13.484 --> 00:40:17.384
So we were kind of like set on like,
okay, we're either gonna live with my

00:40:17.384 --> 00:40:20.955
parents when i's born or his parents, and
I was like, this is not gonna be good.

00:40:21.495 --> 00:40:24.944
Um, but then, yeah, like a week or
two later, I feel like our realtor

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:28.305
called and said that had fallen
through and like if we still would.

00:40:29.265 --> 00:40:31.634
The offer that we had, that it was ours.

00:40:31.634 --> 00:40:34.995
And so, yeah, it was just
a really cool moment cuz we

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.195
thought it was like not ours.

00:40:36.195 --> 00:40:36.735
And then, yeah.

00:40:37.375 --> 00:40:39.134
God opened that opportunity.

00:40:40.455 --> 00:40:42.884
Yeah, that was our would not have
Good, I'm gonna be praying a lot.

00:40:42.884 --> 00:40:45.855
You weren't gonna be peace at
peace . So God provided the Yeah.

00:40:45.975 --> 00:40:46.255
Peace.

00:40:46.255 --> 00:40:47.265
New baby in-laws.

00:40:47.265 --> 00:40:47.475
Yeah.

00:40:47.505 --> 00:40:50.235
We had already sold the, oh, wow.

00:40:50.565 --> 00:40:51.165
Awesome.

00:40:51.945 --> 00:40:53.475
I'll, I'll give one more last chance.

00:40:53.475 --> 00:40:54.645
Anybody else wanna share?

00:40:56.174 --> 00:40:57.435
All right, we're gonna let Megan share.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:06.600
All right, so my, one of my
grandmas died almost two years ago,

00:41:06.959 --> 00:41:11.520
and that side of my family, um,
had suffered a really hard loss.

00:41:11.524 --> 00:41:17.640
My cousin had passed away when she was
15, so they are not people of faith.

00:41:18.089 --> 00:41:21.359
Um, we never talked about any of that.

00:41:21.359 --> 00:41:24.450
It was kind of just this unspoken rule
that people just don't bring that up.

00:41:25.255 --> 00:41:28.275
and I knew when my grandma got
sick that she was gonna die.

00:41:28.455 --> 00:41:32.925
Um, and we drove to Chicago
to say goodbye to her.

00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:35.025
And I remember,

00:41:39.345 --> 00:41:42.465
I remember telling Josh on the
way up there, don't let me leave

00:41:42.465 --> 00:41:44.565
without talking to her about God.

00:41:46.905 --> 00:41:49.995
And I waited until the last minute
because those conversations are so

00:41:49.995 --> 00:41:53.595
heavy and I knew God put it on my
heart that that's what I had to.

00:41:55.245 --> 00:41:58.605
So I talked to her and I asked if
we could talk about it, and she said

00:41:59.295 --> 00:42:03.915
that she'd rather not, and I knew
what that meant for her salvation.

00:42:04.695 --> 00:42:09.345
And so I kept talking her through it and
I asked if we could pray together and

00:42:09.345 --> 00:42:15.315
she said she'd rather not, that it makes
her uncomfortable and I'd left really

00:42:15.315 --> 00:42:17.025
worried for my grandma's salvation.

00:42:23.315 --> 00:42:28.845
it was, and I'm, this story has a happy
ending, I promise, but I'm crying because

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:30.674
it was so emotional and I'm reliving that.

00:42:33.015 --> 00:42:37.815
But I left and I came home and it was
about a week later and I was driving

00:42:37.819 --> 00:42:42.884
in the car and I heard God say to
me, call your grandma right now.

00:42:44.325 --> 00:42:47.265
And I was like, I'll call her
whenever I get where I'm going.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:48.165
And if anyone knows.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.570
and they've ever tried to
reach me on my cell phone.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:54.210
Everybody will say that I'm the
worst person to ever try to get a

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.860
hold of, and I don't respond back.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:57.210
So sorry about that.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:03.090
But I thought, I'll call her when I
get back and God wa God also knows me.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:05.820
And God goes, no, you're
gonna call her right now.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:11.310
And so I pulled over and I parked and I
called my grandma and my brother answered.

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:13.170
And I said, is grandma still here?

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.390
And he said, yes, but she's not talking.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.190
And I said, put the phone to her.

00:43:19.425 --> 00:43:25.485
and I talked her through what she needed
to do and say to God for her salvation.

00:43:26.325 --> 00:43:29.355
And I told her I was gonna pray
with her through it, and I did.

00:43:30.885 --> 00:43:33.555
And a couple hours later I
got the call that she died.

00:43:34.485 --> 00:43:39.945
And when she died, I have never felt
more peace about receiving the news that

00:43:39.945 --> 00:43:46.665
someone had died because God put it on my
heart that she had that conversation with.

00:43:49.484 --> 00:43:56.115
And if you have had that sense of
peace from God where he comes over you

00:43:56.565 --> 00:44:01.845
and tells you it's okay, that feeling
doesn't come from anything else but God.

00:44:02.654 --> 00:44:10.544
And so to have that feeling completely
wash over me was knowing that she

00:44:10.544 --> 00:44:13.634
was going to heaven with God and.

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:21.360
This was back during Covid times, and
so at her funeral there was limited

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.620
capacity and it was really just my
immediate family, and they had asked

00:44:25.625 --> 00:44:30.600
if any of us wanted to come up and
share a story about her, and I had the

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:34.860
opportunity to come up and share that
exact story with all of my family who

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.900
do not have a relationship with Christ.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.410
It's the only time I've ever been
able to talk to any of them about God.

00:44:42.024 --> 00:44:44.984
and I had, God had given me so much
courage in that moment to get through

00:44:44.984 --> 00:44:48.794
it without crying at her funeral
and to be able to share the gospel

00:44:48.794 --> 00:44:50.564
and his testimony with all of them.

00:44:51.435 --> 00:44:54.194
And it was a really, really neat
opportunity that God had put

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.645
that in my path to be able to
present the gospel with them.

00:44:57.674 --> 00:45:00.555
Because it's always been, like I
said, something that's unspoken that

00:45:00.944 --> 00:45:02.384
we just don't bring up with them.

00:45:03.134 --> 00:45:06.674
And it was really, really cool to see
him use that moment to get to share that.

00:45:08.174 --> 00:45:08.535
Awesome.

00:45:08.774 --> 00:45:09.524
Thank you so much for,

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:17.730
I think if we kept going, there'd
be more people that would have

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:19.830
enough boldness maybe to share.

00:45:20.259 --> 00:45:23.250
Um, but our testimonies, and thank
you guys so much for sharing everybody

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:26.100
that did share and those of you
who do have stories, but we're just

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:29.520
afraid to share, my encouragement
is that maybe one day you'll have

00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:30.750
the courage to be able to share.

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:35.310
Uh, but Jesus can be our prince
of peace in our times of.

00:45:36.165 --> 00:45:40.575
Um, and, and here's what I know, uh, as
we think about this as we kind of come

00:45:40.575 --> 00:45:45.165
to a conclusion of our series, is that
each of us lungs for peace in our lives.

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:48.465
I mean, I think everybody in this
room wants peace in our lives, right?

00:45:48.465 --> 00:45:51.855
Peace in our relationships and our
jobs, our hearts and our relationships

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.205
and everything that we do, right?

00:45:53.955 --> 00:45:56.985
Uh, and Jesus is here to provide that
peace through a relationship with him.

00:45:57.795 --> 00:46:01.125
And so, as our, our series concludes,
just thinking through this, I want

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:03.375
you guys to, to know this, that Jesus.

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:08.010
His number one purpose was to save us
right to, to redeem us, to save us from

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:11.950
our sins because we are in a broken
world and we need to be complete.

00:46:11.955 --> 00:46:12.990
And that's the cool part I love.

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:16.750
This is the idea behind the Prince
of Peace is this completeness

00:46:16.755 --> 00:46:18.240
that he brings, right?

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.020
He came to be our wonderful counselor,
our mighty God, our everlasting father,

00:46:22.025 --> 00:46:23.790
our prince of peace, and so much more.

00:46:24.555 --> 00:46:29.115
Um, and I'm hoping, and I'm praying that
this Christmas season will be different

00:46:29.115 --> 00:46:33.735
for all of us, different in the idea
that we understand why Jesus came more

00:46:33.735 --> 00:46:36.855
than for our salvation, but to experience
a personal relationship with him.

00:46:37.155 --> 00:46:41.355
Not to just save us from an eternity
separated from him in hell, but to, to

00:46:41.355 --> 00:46:45.015
save us, to be able to receive a new life.

00:46:46.165 --> 00:46:50.055
I, I think at times we miss
that aspect of salvation.

00:46:50.985 --> 00:46:53.355
Don't dumb it down to
just spending eternity in.

00:46:54.345 --> 00:47:00.135
Let's, let's realize that Jesus came to
give us so, so, so much more, and these

00:47:00.135 --> 00:47:05.445
names of God are ways in which we get
to experience Jesus in a whole new way.

00:47:06.615 --> 00:47:10.935
Um, but before I take some time to pray
and we go into invitation, I wanted

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.315
to talk about this word surrender.

00:47:12.315 --> 00:47:17.305
I think what it takes sometimes
to experience Jesus, uh, in a

00:47:17.545 --> 00:47:20.655
personal way and in a way of,
of where you understand peace.

00:47:20.655 --> 00:47:21.435
It's this word.

00:47:21.865 --> 00:47:21.905
S.

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:26.670
And surrender is such a difficult
idea because what it means is

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:27.870
you have to let down your guard.

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.120
You have to give up.

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:35.160
You have to say, I can't control the
situation anymore that you need Jesus.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.279
And the reason why I share that word
surrender is I need you to understand

00:47:38.279 --> 00:47:40.380
this, is that surrender isn't giving up.

00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.700
It's letting go.

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:46.860
When you surrender to Jesus, it's
not like, man, my life's gonna

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.259
be horrible and life's just.

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:51.540
Just this horrible thing, and I
guess I'll get eternity in heaven,

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.759
but ah, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:47:54.060 --> 00:48:00.420
Surrender is letting go of everything
that weighs you down this side of

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:04.800
heaven, that that burdens you, that,
that causes you to feel like you can

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:10.360
control, and it allows you to receive a
new relationship with Jesus or receive

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:16.710
a new life and to receive peace and to
receive hope and forgiveness so much more.

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:21.330
So as we take some time during invitation,
I want you to to consider that.

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:23.370
So let's take some time to pray.

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.340
Lord Jesus, um, we are so
thankful for you, Lord.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:30.870
We're so thankful for this message of
hope that you've given us in this season.

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:35.130
God, I'm praying for each person in
this room, Lord, that I know that

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:39.030
shared testimonies Lord, but even those
who didn't, who've experienced you as

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:40.440
Prince of Peace, Lord, we celebrate.

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:45.930
Lord, I'm also praying for the, the
people in this room, Lord, um, who haven't

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:47.970
experienced you as Prince of Peace.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:51.630
God, I'm praying for their hearts
right now, Lord, that they begin to,

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.470
to, to remember the stories, not only
from your word Lord, but even from

00:48:55.470 --> 00:49:00.090
the stories that we heard today of how
your peace showed up in times of need.

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:07.090
God, I know that you want to do more
and more in each one of our lives.

00:49:08.535 --> 00:49:13.095
I know that in today is a day where
surrender is so important, Lord, for

00:49:13.095 --> 00:49:16.455
those who need to give their lives
to you or surrender in an area of

00:49:16.455 --> 00:49:19.635
their life, Lord, where they need
to experience you in a new way.

00:49:23.265 --> 00:49:25.905
And so I just wanna do this as, as
you guys continue in an attitude of

00:49:25.905 --> 00:49:32.565
prayer, here's my challenge for you,
as you guys are just thinking and

00:49:33.105 --> 00:49:34.695
considering what God would have you do.

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:37.770
Here's my bold challenge to you.

00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:41.520
If you're struggling to experience
God as a wonderful counselor, a

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:45.540
mighty God, an everlasting father,
or a prince of peace, with no one

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:48.000
looking around, I just want you to
raise your hand so I can pray for you.

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:53.040
I want you to be bold to say
that you need Jesus in that way.

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:57.660
If you're struggling to experience him in
any of those ways, just raise your hand so

00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.810
I can pray for you so I can pray over you.

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:05.609
Here's the thing to try to encourage you.

00:50:06.089 --> 00:50:10.230
My hands up, my one mine went up
first because I know I need prayer

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.259
for those things, so I'm gonna
pray for you, for you specifically

00:50:13.265 --> 00:50:14.430
those who are raising their hands.

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:19.470
Lord Jesus, I pray for those of us that
are raising our hands and those of us

00:50:19.475 --> 00:50:23.490
who maybe wanted to but didn't feel bold
enough to, Lord, I'm praying for them

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:28.109
to experience you in a whole new way
today, Lord, that they experience you as

00:50:28.109 --> 00:50:29.970
everlasting father, that they experience.

00:50:30.674 --> 00:50:35.745
As the prince of peace and the mighty
God that they experience you Lord,

00:50:35.895 --> 00:50:43.095
as a wonderful counselor and a savior
God, give them the boldness to believe

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:47.475
every day in that and to ha build
the relationship, Lord, to know you

00:50:47.475 --> 00:50:48.765
more and more to experience that.

00:50:50.924 --> 00:50:54.585
Lord, I also pray for the person in this
room, Lord, who doesn't know you, who

00:50:54.585 --> 00:51:00.165
hasn't given their lives to you and hasn't
experienced any part of you because they

00:51:00.165 --> 00:51:02.745
haven't surrendered their life to you
through a saving relationship with you.

00:51:04.125 --> 00:51:08.234
And here's my challenge
to you all in this room.

00:51:08.355 --> 00:51:10.544
If you haven't given your
life to Jesus today, you can.

00:51:11.774 --> 00:51:13.904
It's simple because Jesus
has already done all.

00:51:14.685 --> 00:51:15.735
We just have to accept it.

00:51:18.375 --> 00:51:21.225
And so, Lord, I just pray specifically
for the person in this room, Lord, that's

00:51:21.495 --> 00:51:23.325
needing the boldness to say they need you.

00:51:23.715 --> 00:51:26.955
Lord, I pray that they stand
up during this invitation.

00:51:27.165 --> 00:51:30.645
They find me in the back and they
say this, I need to know Jesus.

00:51:31.035 --> 00:51:32.075
I need to give my life to Jesus.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.810
Lord, I'm praying for that person that
may be sitting in the chair that's just

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:41.670
wondering how to have a relationship with
you Lord, to, to even know what to do.

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.890
Lord, I pray that they stand up
during this invitation and they

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:44.940
come back and they talk to me.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:49.410
Lord, today is the day of
salvation and today is the day to

00:51:49.415 --> 00:51:50.730
experience you in a whole new way.

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:53.820
So, Lord, we thank you for today.

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:57.480
We thank you for this
opportunity to have a time of in.

00:51:58.655 --> 00:52:01.245
And to be able to consider everything
that you've taught us and to surrender

00:52:01.245 --> 00:52:03.405
our lives over to you in those areas.

00:52:04.005 --> 00:52:05.265
So, Lord, we pray this
in your heaven name.

00:52:06.015 --> 00:52:06.375
Amen.

00:52:06.735 --> 00:52:07.065
Amen.

00:52:07.935 --> 00:52:10.965
You can continue in an attitude of
prayer as they lead us in worship today.
