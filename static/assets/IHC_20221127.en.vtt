00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.865
Well, we have packed the house
this morning, so make sure, um, you

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.250
leave room for those around you.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:11.880
Okay.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.760
Um, I know that, uh, whenever you,
uh, have been involved in a church

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.680
long enough, there's key days when
you don't typically see people.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:25.065
One of those is this Sunday.

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:27.135
Um, another one's January 1st.

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:30.795
Do you know that like the first sun, I see
January 1st, but like the first Sunday in

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:32.775
January, or the last Sunday in December.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:35.895
Obviously it's not Christmas
time, but is usually what they

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:37.635
call youth Pastor Sundays.

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:40.275
That's when the youth pastor actually
gets to preach because nobody

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:42.394
shows up and the pastor doesn't
have to worry about what they say.

00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:48.615
Um, so, you know, you get days like that
and so still, uh, I think these days are

00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:50.385
awesome opportunity for us to gather.

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:52.035
And so thank you guys for coming out.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.635
I know there may be several that are
watching online because of sickness,

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:57.375
and so we we're praying for you.

00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:00.495
Um, and I know it seems like
every conversation I have, you've

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:01.635
been getting done with sickness.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.495
If you're here today, you're
probably like, Hey, we had that

00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:04.935
last week, so we're here this week.

00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:07.635
So super glad that you guys are here.

00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:12.315
Um, and so those of you who
haven't gotten sick, Me included.

00:01:12.345 --> 00:01:14.625
Let's just keep it that
way and then we'll be good.

00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:20.325
Um, but so today is, um, kind of our start
of transitioning out of the Thanksgiving,

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.725
uh, season, right, and into Christmas.

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:26.295
I know it's not officially December, but
for those of you who have to get through

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:29.985
Thanksgiving, before you'll ever celebrate
Christmas, you can celebrate Christmas.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.650
Now, for those of you who already started,
like Brittany, We'll just continue on.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.310
Okay.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.050
We'll just continue on
doing what we've been doing.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.570
Um, but, uh, it's always a great time
of the year to think about how we can

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.940
emphasize the season of Christmas.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.000
Um, I, I know this, that at times, um, it
can just get crazy cuz we're thinking of.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.010
All the Christmas parties, we gotta
go to all the Christmas gifts.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.120
We've gotta buy, uh, finishing
work and finishing school before

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.030
everything, you know, shuts down
or where are we traveling to.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.070
And so we can really get distracted
behind really what Christmas is all about.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.699
And, uh, because of that, I think
it's always good to take some time

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.790
to step away from the series we were
just in, in second Timothy, and to be

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.250
able to dive into, um, really where
we get to spend four weeks of talking.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.000
Nothing about.

00:02:21.105 --> 00:02:23.625
Nothing about anything,
but other than Jesus.

00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:25.635
And I don't know about you guys,
but I think that's probably a good

00:02:25.635 --> 00:02:28.005
thing if maybe we just talk about
Jesus every single time we come.

00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:29.385
Now, I hope I do.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.020
And the other series.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.250
But a lot of times we're looking at
very practical like life application

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.070
things that we obviously know
that Jesus guides us and directs

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.180
our life and things like that.

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:43.830
But even that, sometimes we can get to the
end and be like, yeah, but Jesus empowers

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.420
us, but this is gonna be all about Jesus.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.410
So we're gonna be talking about.

00:02:46.795 --> 00:02:53.065
Um, in Isaiah chapter nine in verse six,
it talks about four names of the coming

00:02:53.065 --> 00:02:58.135
Messiah, wonderful counselor, mighty
God, eternal Father, and Prince of Peace.

00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:01.495
Um, and so we're gonna cover
one each week, and this week

00:03:01.495 --> 00:03:03.025
we'll cover wonderful counselor.

00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:06.535
Um, and in the midst of that we're
gonna dive into some other things.

00:03:06.535 --> 00:03:07.705
And here's the cool part.

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:08.905
Um, today we.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.370
Talk a lot about context
setting background.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.549
We're gonna talk a lot about how
we got to this point in Isaiah and,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.320
and, and learning a little bit.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.880
My hope is to be able to teach all
of us something new about God's word,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.070
um, and, and to learn a little bit.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.620
So hopefully you guys
have come ready for that.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.230
So, when you think about Christmas,
I wanna start with this question.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.570
When you think about Christmas,
what do you think about?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.829
Like, what's the first thing
that pops into your mind

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:33.790
when you think of Christmas?

00:03:34.185 --> 00:03:35.084
Don't use the whole word.

00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:35.535
Jesus.

00:03:35.535 --> 00:03:36.885
I know that's gonna be this number one.

00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:38.415
So we'll just take that one off the board.

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:39.554
Next go.

00:03:40.695 --> 00:03:43.515
Fruitcake family.

00:03:43.575 --> 00:03:47.204
Christmas tree ornaments resides.

00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:48.225
Whoa, Ola.

00:03:48.855 --> 00:03:49.755
Oh, home alone.

00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:50.834
I was just like, Olaf.

00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:54.810
Do you wanna be able to
snowman, I mean, Yes.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.770
All those things, right?

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.720
We think about all these different things.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.151
And again, those things are so
good because, I mean, I, I know

00:04:01.156 --> 00:04:04.950
this so you guys know, I'm a
little bit new to Christmas.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.500
Um, I actually grew up
not celebrating Christmas.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.960
Um, and, and I really didn't
celebrate until I met Brit.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.620
Uh, and the reason why we didn't
celebrate is because most of it was

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.870
mainly because it, it was a Pagan holiday.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.019
And from my parents' perspective
is, is it didn't really, it wasn't

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.055
Jesus' birthday and it really,
It was taken over by culture.

00:04:23.055 --> 00:04:23.445
Right.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:24.645
Um, so we didn't celebrate.

00:04:24.645 --> 00:04:26.385
So I didn't know anything about presents.

00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:27.945
I didn't know anything about Santa.

00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:31.395
I mean, I watched home Alone, um, but
I really didn't know much about it.

00:04:31.755 --> 00:04:34.335
Um, and then whenever I met Brittany,
she started celebrating or she,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.565
we'd always celebrate Christmas.

00:04:35.565 --> 00:04:38.745
And so I'm like, okay, let
me, I guess it's gifts.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:42.195
So I started joining in buying gifts
and that's what I thought I was about.

00:04:42.195 --> 00:04:45.044
And then I gave my life to
Christ and then it changed.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.780
Christmas totally changed for me because
again, one, I didn't grow up with it.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.990
But then, you know, I went from this
all about presents to, hey, there's

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.289
actually a meaning behind this more
than this tree in these presents.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.820
And those things are good.

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.969
And I don't know if you've ever
read a children's book, uh,

00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:01.289
where it talks about that, right?

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.740
Where it talks about presents are good,
trees are good, all these things are good.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.100
But the reason that we celebrate
Christmas is because of what Christ

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.670
did for us and Christ coming, uh,
and, and all these good things.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.260
And so I think about it this way.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.510
It's easy to forget.

00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:21.015
Why we have Christmas when we have
so many other things that consume us.

00:05:21.015 --> 00:05:25.545
And so I'm hoping that through this series
we'll just be drawn into who Jesus is.

00:05:25.935 --> 00:05:30.645
Uh, who the coming Messiah as Isaac
is talking about is, is what, uh, he

00:05:30.645 --> 00:05:34.815
is giving us through the way in which
he, um, relates to us as a wonderful

00:05:34.815 --> 00:05:39.255
counselor or a mighty God, or an
eternal father, or a prince of peace.

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:45.945
And I, I think about this, that when we
think about, uh, Christmas, we should not

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:54.045
miss the, the heart of it, but also not
get also distracted from, um, not only

00:05:54.045 --> 00:05:57.075
even just the purpose of it, but, but
even this, I would say this in everything

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.875
we do in Christmas with the Christmas
season Jesus in is in every part of it.

00:06:01.935 --> 00:06:02.985
When you give a gift.

00:06:04.035 --> 00:06:06.555
You can actually give a gift from
the heart of what Jesus did for you.

00:06:06.935 --> 00:06:10.005
Whenever you go and see the lights,
like we went to Kings Island last

00:06:10.005 --> 00:06:13.395
night and we got to see all these
amazing lights and the smells.

00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:14.325
Oh man, I was so hungry.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.825
Smells were so good.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.980
You know what it makes me think the
blessing it has to be able to have

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.080
taste and smell and eyes to see.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.210
So in all of that, I, I'm hoping that
when we see this coming, Messiah meant to

00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:31.740
save us from our sins, but also to give
us a hope and, and a life and something

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.080
exciting that we can see all these things
during this season as a blessing from God.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.230
And not look at them as, hey,
we have to separate them, right?

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.310
Because we don't have to just have no,
no Christmas and just all about Christ

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.540
or no Christ and all about Christmas.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.460
We can have both in all of that.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.520
Um, and so we need to
continue to, to do that.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.300
Um, and so I want us to jump into
this text in Isaiah chapter nine.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.859
Starting in verse six, we're just
gonna cover verse six and seven.

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:00.979
And again, we're just gonna cover a
portion of it this week, and we'll

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:02.090
do that for the next three weeks.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.690
After this, I'm gonna make sure
we catch everybody up as well.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.120
So here's what it says in verse six.

00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:11.020
It says, for a child will be born for us.

00:07:12.255 --> 00:07:16.245
A son will be given to us and
the government will be on his

00:07:16.245 --> 00:07:18.284
shoulders and he will be named.

00:07:18.344 --> 00:07:23.325
Wonderful counselor, mighty God,
eternal father and prince of peace.

00:07:23.775 --> 00:07:29.085
The dominion will be vast and its
prosperity will never end his reign on

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.975
the throne of David and over his kingdom
to establish and sustain it with justice

00:07:33.975 --> 00:07:37.155
and righteousness from now on and forever.

00:07:37.305 --> 00:07:39.914
And the zero of the Lord of
Armies will accomplish this.

00:07:40.365 --> 00:07:41.895
So let's pray before we jump in.

00:07:42.315 --> 00:07:46.185
Lord Jesus, we pray, Lord, that
your word, uh, will not return void.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:52.335
Lord, I know that you have, um, this
word here for us today to learn and to

00:07:52.335 --> 00:07:56.175
remind us of who you are and how you
relate to us, and why you were sent.

00:07:56.895 --> 00:08:00.495
And, uh, Lord, I pray that we don't
leave outta here, um, without being

00:08:00.495 --> 00:08:02.895
changed, Lord, in our hearts and
our lives and our minds, Lord.

00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:08.115
Um, and may it draw us closer to
you and also an opportunity to see

00:08:08.115 --> 00:08:12.535
everything we do in this season of
Christmas through, uh, the lens of, of,

00:08:12.545 --> 00:08:15.815
of a savior that was sent, um, for us.

00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:17.865
And so, Lord, we just pray
this in your heaven name.

00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:23.145
So the first thing that I want to do is I
kind of want to go into a history lesson.

00:08:23.145 --> 00:08:28.515
And, and this is the reason why I, I, I,
I consistently, as I study my Bible as

00:08:28.705 --> 00:08:35.325
a pastor, I consistently go back to when
I was saved and looking at this Bible

00:08:35.325 --> 00:08:37.935
as a boring book of confusing material.

00:08:38.865 --> 00:08:42.135
And it got even more confusing because
like, I would start off in Genesis

00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:44.445
every time anybody ever do that, like
I'm gonna read through the whole Bible

00:08:44.445 --> 00:08:45.615
and I would get through Genesis Exo.

00:08:46.635 --> 00:08:49.515
That's about as far, cause Leviticus
and numbers kind of got really boring,

00:08:49.935 --> 00:08:51.465
but that's about as far as I would get.

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:53.895
Well then whenever I really got
good, you know, like the good

00:08:53.895 --> 00:08:56.775
Christian, I made it to the prophets.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.780
The prophets were, I had no clue
what the prophets were saying.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.430
Like they just didn't make sense.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.610
So I wanna suggest something to you
because it took a long time for me to

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.440
kinda learn how the Bible's put together.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.590
And I'm gonna kind of talk through a
little bit of today if you're interested

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.880
in knowing how the Bible works together
and the key themes that connect together.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.790
Some of our guys went through
a study together called How

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.290
to Study the Bible in 30 days.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.850
You don't have to do it in 30 days.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.340
We actually did it over like, I
don't know, three or four months.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.210
We did it together.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:29.350
Um, and it really breaks down how the
Bible connects together, how the prophets

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.930
overlay into the Old Testament and how
they are there prophesying during the

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.930
times of some of the Kings and all the
things like this is, is really cool.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:42.520
Um, and so I would just suggest that book
to you, but I wanna take some time to

00:09:42.525 --> 00:09:44.439
kind of walk through specifically here in.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.160
And see, um, how I can help you,
uh, and us understand the setting.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:50.940
So I'll look at it this way.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.360
Who is, um, a big Marvel fan?

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.950
Anybody like watching Marvel movies?

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:56.430
Okay.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:57.450
Okay.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.270
Um, so who knows, you
know, uh, stark, right?

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.140
What, what, what does he do?

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.230
He, he, a lot of times you see
him as this brain accurate guy.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.120
And typically when he's trying to
solve a problem, what does he do?

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.700
He walks into a room and somehow
he pulls up all these screen.

00:10:09.474 --> 00:10:11.295
That's one of my favorite things.

00:10:11.535 --> 00:10:14.745
Literally all these screens are everywhere
and he starts pulling things from these

00:10:14.745 --> 00:10:15.824
screens and like throwing 'em here.

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:18.194
And sometimes he crumbles 'em up and
throws 'em away and he pulls it all

00:10:18.194 --> 00:10:19.425
together and it makes sense, right?

00:10:19.425 --> 00:10:23.775
He usually finds something and it's
like, ah, it all comes together.

00:10:24.344 --> 00:10:26.444
So today I wanna kind of
take some of these screens.

00:10:26.444 --> 00:10:29.055
I'm not as cool as him, uh, and
pulls some of this together where

00:10:29.055 --> 00:10:32.324
hopefully we can all see this together.

00:10:32.324 --> 00:10:34.334
So it's gonna be a little
bit of a history lesson.

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:37.035
So when we look at this, a
prophet obviously is prophesying.

00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:38.295
Future.

00:10:38.355 --> 00:10:38.715
Right.

00:10:39.135 --> 00:10:43.125
Um, and, and Isaiah specifically
was speaking to people living

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:45.225
in three different time periods.

00:10:45.255 --> 00:10:46.305
Three different time periods.

00:10:46.665 --> 00:10:49.195
One is, and I'm gonna talk through
these time periods a little bit more

00:10:49.335 --> 00:10:53.835
in detail in just a minute, was before
the, the people of Israel were exile

00:10:53.835 --> 00:10:58.485
to Babylon, uh, was during the people
who would be daring, the exile of

00:10:58.485 --> 00:11:02.505
Babylon, and then those, those who
would be after the exile of Babylon.

00:11:02.505 --> 00:11:03.945
So that's the future times.

00:11:04.485 --> 00:11:05.655
So here was his message.

00:11:05.655 --> 00:11:09.315
His message in Isaiah is a message
of judgment to the people of

00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:11.985
Israel who were sending against
God and refusing to repent.

00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:13.545
So he's like, Hey, judgment's coming.

00:11:14.055 --> 00:11:18.885
But then he consistently filtered
in a message of hope, and what we

00:11:18.885 --> 00:11:22.215
see here is this message of hope
is the future king and the line

00:11:22.215 --> 00:11:23.625
of David, which will be Jesus.

00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:28.125
So we get to see this from like in the
future, looking back for them, they

00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:29.385
were looking for a coming Messiah.

00:11:29.385 --> 00:11:31.545
We already know that Messiah
has come and obviously a second.

00:11:32.415 --> 00:11:35.864
Um, but it, it, it's a different
picture for them than it is for us.

00:11:36.375 --> 00:11:39.344
Um, so in this chapter when
we look at this, he's speaking

00:11:39.675 --> 00:11:40.905
of the Southern kingdom.

00:11:40.905 --> 00:11:44.204
So I'm gonna break this down cuz I wanna
make sure we're all in the same part here.

00:11:44.444 --> 00:11:45.375
How did we get here?

00:11:46.064 --> 00:11:49.964
I'm gonna jump to Matthew to kind
of help us pull the story together.

00:11:49.964 --> 00:11:52.995
So if you got your Bible with you,
I want you to go to Matthew chapter.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.600
Again, we're gonna just do some,
some learning together here.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.790
Matthew chapter one talks about
the lineage of Jesus, starting with

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.480
Abraham, and I'm gonna read these
accounts and kind of break this down.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.580
And so this is what it says
in Matthew chapter one.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.820
It says, in account of the
genealogy of Jesus Christ, the

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.800
son of David, the son of Abraham.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.720
And so it says Abraham.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.460
This is the part where
most of us just check out.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.600
Anybody ever do that?

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.100
Where you check out,
it's like the genealogy.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:20.910
I don't check out.

00:12:22.035 --> 00:12:23.265
Please don't check out.

00:12:23.655 --> 00:12:29.505
So Abraham fathered Isaac, if you
remember, Abraham was where God says,

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.555
Hey, I'm gonna make you basically a
mighty nation, as many as the stars.

00:12:33.555 --> 00:12:37.695
And Abraham believed God and he
accounted at him as righteousness, right?

00:12:37.905 --> 00:12:42.645
And so he was gonna do that through
his son Isaac and Isaac fathered Jacob.

00:12:43.245 --> 00:12:47.475
And if you know in a little bit
about Jacob, Jacob is later renamed.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:48.600
Israel.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.500
And the reason why is because Jacob
has 12 sons, which become the 12

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.079
tribes of Israel, 12 tribes of Israel.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.900
So if you think about this,
this is why the people of God

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.280
are known as the Israelites.

00:13:00.135 --> 00:13:01.455
So that's a really cool thing.

00:13:01.485 --> 00:13:05.085
So if we continue on here, then
Jacob fathered Judah, right?

00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:09.975
And his brothers Judah Fathered
Perez and Zera and Tamar and Perez.

00:13:09.975 --> 00:13:12.405
Fathered Hezron and Hezron fathered.

00:13:13.575 --> 00:13:18.735
Aaron Fathered, and I'm not gonna
say I'm all right, and Meab fathered

00:13:19.095 --> 00:13:24.045
Na Sean and Neon Fathered Selman
and Selman Fathered Boaz by Rahab,

00:13:24.405 --> 00:13:25.665
which is another cool story.

00:13:25.845 --> 00:13:27.915
Boaz fathered Obi by.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.010
O fathered Jesse and
Jesse fathered King David.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.230
So this is where we get to
the point of King David.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.640
Most of us understand King David.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.310
Is this the one who killed the Goliath?

00:13:38.315 --> 00:13:38.640
Right?

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.290
And he became the second king.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.750
Um, and then you see
here, we're gonna go on.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.660
So David fathered Solomon by Uriah's wife
Solomon fathered Raya Bo and Raya Bowman

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.850
fathered a Aja and Aja fathered Asa and
Asa fathered JSA fat and Joseph Fat.

00:13:54.495 --> 00:13:58.995
Jerome, Jerome fathered us,
US Father Jo Jo fathered.

00:13:59.175 --> 00:13:59.415
Aha.

00:13:59.415 --> 00:14:00.135
I wanna stop there.

00:14:01.785 --> 00:14:06.615
You're wondering, when is Isaiah
writing this During Aha Reign?

00:14:06.675 --> 00:14:08.475
So this is the reason why
I'm reading this genealogy.

00:14:08.475 --> 00:14:11.505
I want you to see all this
happened to get to Jesus.

00:14:11.505 --> 00:14:15.165
We're not even there yet if you're looking
at Isaiah, but this is the point in which

00:14:15.165 --> 00:14:20.235
Isaiah is speaking to the people of Israel
and he's speaking to the Southern kingdom.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.315
What do you mean by the Southern kingdom?

00:14:21.315 --> 00:14:21.795
Well, here's what.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.030
You had King David, who had obviously
his son Solomon, after Solomon's reign.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.610
He had some sons that
were not really great.

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:32.339
There were some infighting,
some major things that happened

00:14:32.459 --> 00:14:34.530
and the kingdom was split.

00:14:34.589 --> 00:14:36.150
Does anybody know how
the kingdom was split?

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:39.329
Anybody into two?

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.459
How many tribes went to one?

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:43.949
What was that?

00:14:45.089 --> 00:14:47.819
So most think it's 11, it's actually 10.

00:14:47.819 --> 00:14:48.360
Go to.

00:14:49.605 --> 00:14:50.475
Two go to another.

00:14:50.745 --> 00:14:54.105
And the reason why Benjamin's, the
smallest tribe, Benjamin goes with Judah.

00:14:54.525 --> 00:14:58.605
So it's actually two and 10, but
they call the two the tribe of Judah.

00:14:59.175 --> 00:15:00.975
So Benjamin doesn't even
get any credit here.

00:15:00.975 --> 00:15:02.325
See, that's what happens, Ben.

00:15:02.895 --> 00:15:03.555
He's just humble.

00:15:03.555 --> 00:15:04.245
That's what it is.

00:15:04.575 --> 00:15:06.525
And then you got the other
10 tribes, which are ruled.

00:15:06.795 --> 00:15:09.555
So these kingdoms now become
split and they're split.

00:15:09.555 --> 00:15:11.685
And if you are reading in the
Old Testament, you're gonna

00:15:11.685 --> 00:15:14.235
hear them talk about, you know,
after obviously the split.

00:15:14.925 --> 00:15:19.185
The Israelites or Israel, and you're
gonna hear them, the tribe of Judah, the

00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:20.295
tribe of Israel, and the tribe of Judah.

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:23.835
These are the southern kingdom, is the,
the tribe of Judah, and the northern

00:15:23.835 --> 00:15:25.665
kingdom is the tribe of Israel.

00:15:26.835 --> 00:15:29.415
Isaiah is speaking directly
to the southern kingdom.

00:15:29.475 --> 00:15:31.185
So again, trying to pull
these pieces together.

00:15:31.185 --> 00:15:32.205
How did we get here?

00:15:32.355 --> 00:15:36.615
All these pieces together so he sees
speaking to this southern kingdom.

00:15:37.035 --> 00:15:38.955
Um, here's what's happening, Israel.

00:15:39.915 --> 00:15:42.915
The Northern Kingdom and
Syria were pressuring Judah

00:15:42.915 --> 00:15:44.595
to join them against a Syria.

00:15:45.675 --> 00:15:46.875
And Judah didn't like this.

00:15:46.875 --> 00:15:49.665
And so King aas as a has, was afraid.

00:15:50.085 --> 00:15:52.365
And so he decided to go to Syria for help.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.905
And we're seeing that isn't a
smart thing, and Isaiah's kind

00:15:55.905 --> 00:15:57.915
of prophesying against this move.

00:15:58.245 --> 00:16:00.855
And so this is where we start seeing
these profits again, prophecies

00:16:00.855 --> 00:16:04.635
against Judah, about their
future defeat, exile, and return.

00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:07.565
And in the midst of these prophecies,
I'm trying to pull this all together.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.490
In the midst of these prophecies, he
includes these prophecies about a child

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:16.200
who would represent God's presence,
have his characteristics, and have the

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.210
responsibilities to rule over his people.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.900
So consistently in the book
of Isaiah, they're living in

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.450
a time of now and not yet.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.440
They were hearing about this coming
judgment to exile, but they also

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.900
were hearing about a coming king,
which would happen way in the future.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.390
How does this represent to us?

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.390
We're way in the future and the
Messiahs came and we're looking.

00:16:37.365 --> 00:16:40.455
It's cool to see how God works
everything together, even

00:16:40.455 --> 00:16:41.565
all the way back to Abraham.

00:16:41.805 --> 00:16:43.305
Why is the whole Bible important?

00:16:43.305 --> 00:16:44.505
Used to when I got saved.

00:16:44.505 --> 00:16:47.295
I'm telling you, I refused
to read the Old Testament.

00:16:47.535 --> 00:16:48.915
It didn't make sense to me.

00:16:49.185 --> 00:16:50.175
Now I love it.

00:16:50.235 --> 00:16:50.685
Why?

00:16:50.685 --> 00:16:52.695
Because I understand
how it works together.

00:16:52.755 --> 00:16:56.715
And when we read Matthew chapter one,
we see how it all connects together.

00:16:56.865 --> 00:16:59.475
So I wanna finish reading these
genealogies to get us all the way to.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.140
So here's what it says.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.000
Aha fathered heza.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.099
Heza fathered manas manas fathered Aon.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:05.910
Aon fathered.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:06.420
Josiah.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:11.940
Josiah fathered Jhan and his brothers
at the time of the exile to Babylon.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:16.920
So at this point, this is when they
get exiled after the exile to Babylon.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:18.480
Jhan fathered.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.139
She Sheila tight, and I don't know
how to say this is a rubber woo.

00:17:22.145 --> 00:17:23.220
Fathered a.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:30.750
Fathered, ECLA, fathered,
azo, oc ache, iod, mathum.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.810
All these down here to Jacob
and then Jacob, father Joseph.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.550
Now we finally get to this, okay.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.910
Jacob, father Joseph, the
husband of Mary who gave birth

00:17:38.915 --> 00:17:40.680
to Jesus, who was called Christ.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.240
Interesting fact.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.139
Did you see the line that,
that Matthew pulled here?

00:17:46.139 --> 00:17:47.400
Went all the way through Joseph.

00:17:49.139 --> 00:17:51.840
Was Joseph the biological father of Jesus?

00:17:53.745 --> 00:17:57.315
No, because I mean really he wasn't
because that was the Holy Spirit.

00:17:57.645 --> 00:18:00.195
But it's still cool because
it still brought how important

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.485
Joseph's lineage to this.

00:18:01.485 --> 00:18:02.475
So there's more to this.

00:18:02.475 --> 00:18:04.905
I'm not gonna get caught off on this,
but I'm wanting you to see this.

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:10.605
Obviously this all points to Christ,
all the way from Abraham to Christ.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:15.675
All of these things are here to remind
us that God was working a plan all along.

00:18:16.004 --> 00:18:18.705
And if you're wondering why
God's plan is still not fulfilled

00:18:18.705 --> 00:18:19.935
yet, which means his second.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.710
They had to wait a long
time for the first coming.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.700
It, it's gonna take a little bit a while
for us to see the second coming as well.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.910
And we don't know this, so let's
kind of stick more to the focus here.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.050
So the first prophecy I wanna talk about
that they, that Isaiah spoke about,

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.250
Jesus was in chapter seven, and I wanna
reference this just so we know this.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:43.121
The first reference was in chapter seven
where he says this in verses 14 through.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.010
Says, therefore, the Lord
himself will give you a sign.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.670
See, the virgin will conceive and
have a sign and name him Emmanuel.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.970
And by the time he learns to reject
what is bad and choose what is good,

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.590
he will be eating Kurds and honey.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.910
Where before the boy knows to reject
what is bad and choose what is good.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.610
The land of the two kings
you dread will be abandoned.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.639
And so that's the first point
in which we see the prophecy

00:19:05.639 --> 00:19:07.020
of Jesus, the coming Messiah.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:11.100
And Amanda read in Matthew
chapter one, verse 23.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.220
The affirmation of that prophecy.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.500
And I wanna mention this one more
time and then we're gonna stick

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.820
to the text that we have here.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.700
And I wanna read it to you
because this is the cool part.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.390
You see a prophecy and it's
fulfilled in Matthew 1 23.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:28.200
It says, see, the virgin will become
pregnant and give birth to a son,

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.330
and they will name him Manuel.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:37.620
So this is where we see Isaiah was
pointing towards Christ coming so.

00:19:38.145 --> 00:19:39.735
Why did Christ come?

00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:41.475
Why was he sent?

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:44.835
And here's the cool part is
we see these names, right?

00:19:44.835 --> 00:19:47.085
The second prophecy of Jesus is coming.

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.535
Um, and we see these names that
represent him, but I want us to

00:19:50.785 --> 00:19:53.745
kind of see how Isaiah describes it.

00:19:53.745 --> 00:19:58.485
He says this, he says, for a
child would be born for us, right?

00:19:58.485 --> 00:20:00.525
A child will be born for us.

00:20:00.735 --> 00:20:06.105
And I think about this, Jesus is a gift
from God who likes receiving gifts.

00:20:08.355 --> 00:20:10.274
Couple of you, the rest
of you're like, Nope.

00:20:11.115 --> 00:20:14.205
Uh, we were watching a play at
Kings Island and there was, uh, the

00:20:14.205 --> 00:20:16.784
Scrooge on there and the guy, all
he had to say was bought humbug.

00:20:17.205 --> 00:20:19.185
Those of you who didn't say you
wanted a gift, that must be you.

00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:20.324
You don't really care.

00:20:20.834 --> 00:20:23.655
Christmas doesn't matter to
you, but I like receiving gifts.

00:20:24.284 --> 00:20:25.304
I, I really do.

00:20:25.754 --> 00:20:29.985
And, and when I think about a gift,
I like receiving gifts that I really

00:20:29.985 --> 00:20:34.125
like, not the the socks that I don't
really like or the underwear that

00:20:34.125 --> 00:20:38.595
I know I need, but I like receiving
gifts that mean something to me.

00:20:39.254 --> 00:20:43.425
So I want you to view today in
this idea of Jesus's privacy of

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.545
this coming gift that you know
you're gonna receive in the future.

00:20:46.935 --> 00:20:50.145
Think this direction if you've
ever obviously been waiting

00:20:50.145 --> 00:20:51.975
on a child to come, right?

00:20:52.034 --> 00:20:54.436
That desire that you are to see your.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.730
This is exactly what we see
here in this coming child.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:04.530
He says this, for a child,
we'd be born for us, for us.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.740
So all along God had a plan.

00:21:07.745 --> 00:21:11.490
We know this back to Adam and
Eve was the reason why we broke

00:21:11.495 --> 00:21:13.080
our relationship with God, right?

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.200
And we had to have that
relationship restored in some way.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.170
So God decided to do something about it.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.250
He decided to send Jesus to
take the punishment of our sin.

00:21:24.255 --> 00:21:27.885
The reason why we have sin in our life
is anything we say do or don't do that

00:21:27.885 --> 00:21:29.835
is against God's plan for our life.

00:21:29.985 --> 00:21:30.705
That's sin.

00:21:31.065 --> 00:21:35.535
It's God's best for us, is what he's
wanting for us, but it's the way we are

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.425
living is not even the second best, right?

00:21:37.425 --> 00:21:41.775
We are living a second best life or second
rate life when we don't choose God's best.

00:21:42.195 --> 00:21:46.125
And so God's sent Jesus for us, right?

00:21:46.125 --> 00:21:51.255
For us, not for anybody else but
to be placed in our place of.

00:21:52.334 --> 00:21:56.145
But then he goes on, he says this,
A son will be given to us, right?

00:21:56.145 --> 00:21:59.564
So Jesus was sent for us because
we couldn't do it on our own.

00:21:59.564 --> 00:22:02.445
We couldn't save ourselves from
our sins, but he was given to us.

00:22:02.834 --> 00:22:03.675
Think about this.

00:22:03.975 --> 00:22:05.625
God had Jesus.

00:22:05.629 --> 00:22:08.834
If you think about the whole again,
if you say the Bible enough, Jesus

00:22:08.834 --> 00:22:14.205
was there before with God in the
beginning, and then he came to earth

00:22:14.235 --> 00:22:15.824
and he will be there in the end.

00:22:16.604 --> 00:22:19.905
So Jesus existed before in
heaven, and he left heaven.

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:21.074
He left the presence of.

00:22:22.169 --> 00:22:25.439
To go live amongst us to take our place.

00:22:25.649 --> 00:22:27.030
See, I think about this picture.

00:22:27.629 --> 00:22:34.200
Uh, I mean, I don't know if I could take
someone else's place when it comes to

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:39.149
paying for their sins, because most of
us look at people who deserve punishment

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.310
and they say they get what they deserve.

00:22:41.939 --> 00:22:45.090
But to think that you would take
their place as something difficult.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.409
And so that's exactly what God did.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.919
God took Jesus out of heaven
and put, placed him on.

00:22:51.524 --> 00:22:52.965
To, to, to live the life.

00:22:52.965 --> 00:22:55.335
We couldn't live in our place.

00:22:55.365 --> 00:22:57.105
So he was given to us.

00:22:57.435 --> 00:23:00.014
And then he says this, the
government will be on his shoulders.

00:23:00.345 --> 00:23:02.865
This is, I think, an important thought.

00:23:03.225 --> 00:23:06.795
All the responsibility
will be on Jesus, not us.

00:23:07.455 --> 00:23:11.385
See guided, not only just replace, like
take our place through Jesus, right?

00:23:11.385 --> 00:23:12.345
We deserve the punishment.

00:23:12.345 --> 00:23:16.305
But Jesus came and took our place, but
then he took all the weight of the.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.800
You guys ever had to make an
important decision where you

00:23:19.805 --> 00:23:23.460
felt like that depending on which
direction you choose, it was gonna

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.900
change the trajectory of your life.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.690
Those are weighty decisions.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.100
You fill them.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:34.740
Well, Jesus coming and taking the weight
of the sin and the judgment, he took

00:23:34.745 --> 00:23:40.020
that weight off of us and placed it
on himself, and he placed the future.

00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:43.800
Um, and we'll talk more about that as
well as this future kingdom coming.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.590
He placed all that
responsibility on Jesus.

00:23:47.024 --> 00:23:51.074
When I think about leadership, I think
about leaders who take on responsibility,

00:23:51.074 --> 00:23:54.735
and the more that people that you
lead, the more responsibility you feel.

00:23:55.455 --> 00:24:00.105
Jesus is the king of
the world of all people.

00:24:00.524 --> 00:24:04.514
Imagine that weight that was on
Jesus' shoulders for coming to

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:09.885
earth and given being given to
us and for us to take our place.

00:24:10.635 --> 00:24:16.274
See, God's red plan has always been
about generosity and always been about.

00:24:16.995 --> 00:24:19.425
Us and helping us.

00:24:19.965 --> 00:24:22.604
And so when we think about this season
of Christmas, and I know I haven't

00:24:22.604 --> 00:24:24.405
even gotten to the major word in this.

00:24:24.524 --> 00:24:27.854
When you think about the season
of Christmas, a lot of times we

00:24:27.854 --> 00:24:29.294
think about what we don't have.

00:24:29.625 --> 00:24:31.514
I mean, most of us, I
mean, you could be wrong.

00:24:31.995 --> 00:24:34.695
I wish we had a little bit
more money to buy more gifts.

00:24:35.445 --> 00:24:37.304
I wish we had more time.

00:24:37.635 --> 00:24:39.284
I wish we could go more places.

00:24:39.584 --> 00:24:42.915
You know, I, I, it's like, I seem like
I want more during this Christmas.

00:24:44.355 --> 00:24:49.845
But when I read about all that God gave
during the season, I really kind of want

00:24:49.845 --> 00:24:55.545
to just receive that and maybe give a
little bit of that to people because God

00:24:55.545 --> 00:24:58.395
has given us so much during the season.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.595
We don't need anything else.

00:25:00.525 --> 00:25:02.475
He is the perfect present.

00:25:03.345 --> 00:25:07.605
He is the perfect gift that we could
ever receive during the season.

00:25:07.635 --> 00:25:10.035
And the cool part is it's a never ending.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.160
It's here every day and it's here
when it's not Christmas season, guys,

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:17.970
on January 1st, Jesus is still the
greatest gift we'll ever be given.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.160
Same thing on July 1st.

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:23.310
We can celebrate Christmas in
July cuz it's the greatest gift

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:24.720
that's ever been given to us.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:31.630
But why do we take seasons like Christmas
to remember well, why do we take days

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.630
once a year to celebrate your birthday?

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.620
Because we wanna recognize
the special gift of your.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.120
And if we didn't do that,
sometimes we would just neglect

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.000
how important our lives are.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.360
Right.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.500
How important our lives are.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:47.939
And so I think it's pretty special.

00:25:47.939 --> 00:25:49.919
Even though I don't like people
singing to me and all that,

00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:50.820
I do think it's pretty cool.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.270
Whenever it is my birthday and I get to
choose the cake cuz it's cookie brownies.

00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:55.470
I love cookie brownies.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.860
Right.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.179
That's what I want for my cake.

00:25:57.179 --> 00:25:57.750
And it's not cake.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:02.429
I know, but, but it's about me and
it's kind of, because it's special.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:07.470
So we take time during Christmas to
remember how special Jesus is, and the

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:12.390
cool part is we'll never get tired of
talking about how special Jesus is.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.270
So now you're wondering, are
we ever gonna get there to

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.830
talk about the names of Jesus?

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:17.190
We're here.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.350
Okay, I wanna set some of this up.

00:26:19.649 --> 00:26:22.740
So the child, the Savior, Jesus,
will have many names, right?

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.409
These names are given to us,
to comfort us, to encourage

00:26:25.415 --> 00:26:27.690
us, to remind us who Jesus is.

00:26:27.929 --> 00:26:32.159
And the first one we see here is this,
for this child will be born for us,

00:26:32.165 --> 00:26:35.129
the son will be given to us, and the
government will be on his shoulders

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.679
and he will be named wonderful.

00:26:38.159 --> 00:26:38.220
C.

00:26:39.659 --> 00:26:42.570
I begin to just look at this like
I, I mean, again, if I'm gonna talk

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.929
about just a name during the majority
of my message, I'm gonna spend a lot

00:26:45.929 --> 00:26:49.860
of time just thinking through, what
is the word wonderful counselor mean?

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.200
Why is this important for us today?

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:58.770
Why would God place that name through
Isaiah's words and a prophecy to

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.050
the people of Judah and us as well?

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.970
Well, number one, let's
just look at context.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:06.300
The people of Judah were getting ready
to go into exile and judgment for their.

00:27:07.725 --> 00:27:09.255
They were gonna need a wise counselor.

00:27:09.435 --> 00:27:13.275
They're gonna need somebody who could
counsel them above and beyond anything

00:27:13.275 --> 00:27:14.805
they could understand and fully know.

00:27:15.645 --> 00:27:17.385
I would say that same thing for us.

00:27:17.505 --> 00:27:19.605
So let's kind of dive
into wonderful counselor.

00:27:19.605 --> 00:27:21.945
First of all, let's dive
into the first part of it.

00:27:21.975 --> 00:27:26.085
Wonder, when you think of wonderful,
you have to start with wonder.

00:27:26.085 --> 00:27:28.035
Wonder is extraordinary.

00:27:28.425 --> 00:27:30.495
It's hard to understand.

00:27:30.765 --> 00:27:32.715
It's something that you marvel.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.910
But now let's add the
full part of it, right?

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.970
Wonderful means extreme wonder,
full of wonder, astonishing.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.890
And I wanna place this one
above our comprehension.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.430
So now let's look at the counselor part
and then we're gonna put it all together.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.500
So he's a wonderful counselor.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.570
So a counselor is an advisor
to give advice on life, to

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.820
walk alongside and to guide.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:01.470
I think of it this way, a blind person
with a stick that is obviously trying

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:02.620
to figure out where they're going.

00:28:03.044 --> 00:28:07.605
God is our guide in our lives, so
I wanna put this together for us.

00:28:07.695 --> 00:28:12.824
Jesus is above anything in the world
that we can comprehend when it comes

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:14.445
to guiding and directing our lives.

00:28:14.925 --> 00:28:19.845
Jesus is above anything in the world
that we can comprehend when it comes

00:28:19.845 --> 00:28:21.314
to guiding and directing our lives.

00:28:21.665 --> 00:28:23.595
Let's name a few things.

00:28:23.745 --> 00:28:25.725
When you need advice, where do you go?

00:28:26.445 --> 00:28:26.895
Where do you go?

00:28:28.705 --> 00:28:30.465
Google your dad.

00:28:31.935 --> 00:28:35.325
What a friend, husband.

00:28:38.725 --> 00:28:38.845
Hmm.

00:28:39.495 --> 00:28:39.915
Bible.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.145
Hey, look at you being spiritual.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:41.805
That's good.

00:28:42.645 --> 00:28:44.055
Anybody just go with their gut feeling?

00:28:44.565 --> 00:28:46.785
Uh, this feels right, right?

00:28:47.115 --> 00:28:47.385
Yeah.

00:28:47.715 --> 00:28:51.195
I think we go a lot of places,
and again, those places are good,

00:28:52.725 --> 00:28:54.675
but what if there's a person?

00:28:55.385 --> 00:28:58.725
What if there's a savior that.

00:28:59.265 --> 00:29:05.955
Has above our comprehension understanding
of how we should live in the midst

00:29:05.955 --> 00:29:09.915
of our circumstances, because
y'all know we have difficulties.

00:29:10.185 --> 00:29:14.385
We have sickness, we have death,
we have financial struggles,

00:29:14.445 --> 00:29:15.675
we have relational struggles.

00:29:16.665 --> 00:29:21.165
We also have just a life in general to
live and, and lots of decisions to make

00:29:21.165 --> 00:29:24.945
and lots of things that'll affect not only
our future, but everybody else's future.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.045
And let's just even think
about eternity, man.

00:29:27.045 --> 00:29:29.055
There's a lot of things
that weigh into that.

00:29:29.415 --> 00:29:33.735
How do we know how to make those
decisions live life, and be

00:29:33.735 --> 00:29:35.145
guided in the right direction?

00:29:35.535 --> 00:29:40.605
Jesus, when we, when we look at
this text and we see that the coming

00:29:40.605 --> 00:29:43.695
Messiah, Jesus is a wonderful counselor.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.280
Above our comprehension and
understanding they can guide and direct

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.630
our lives in the way we should go.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.170
To me, it's a logical
ding, ding, ding, ding.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:53.670
That's where we should go every day.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:58.110
That's where we should go every
moment for every part of our lives.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.710
By a raise of hands, how many
of y'all go there every day

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:02.450
because you're just so great.

00:30:03.764 --> 00:30:03.975
Great.

00:30:03.975 --> 00:30:04.274
Not me.

00:30:04.274 --> 00:30:04.905
I'm putting down my hand.

00:30:04.905 --> 00:30:06.254
I was just doing that to
show you how to do it.

00:30:06.675 --> 00:30:09.945
Cause I don't, like, I'm telling you
guys, like I, I sit here and I'm starting

00:30:09.945 --> 00:30:12.585
to think through this Sears, and I'm
going, okay, here's who Jesus is.

00:30:12.705 --> 00:30:15.195
He's, he's this coming aside that's
gonna be a wonderful counselor.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.965
And I'm reading about it and I'm
going, man, this guy's awesome man.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:23.205
Why don't I like seek
his counsel more often.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:29.820
Why, why do I not like, understand
his knowledge of my life is way

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.990
broader than I can understand
because I get so narrow minded.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.270
Let me just give you a great example.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.880
I think the world's fallen
apart in the last year.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.400
We don't know why we
couldn't find a facility.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.490
I mean, I, God, we need one.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.500
I mean like this works, but
we really need something else.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.880
And I'm wondering what God's doing and
I'm like thinking, what am I doing?

00:30:52.379 --> 00:30:53.610
I'm searching Google.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:31:00.030
I'm asking friends, consulting
pastors, talking to people using my

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.879
gut feeling and nothing works, man.

00:31:02.879 --> 00:31:03.720
God, what are you doing?

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.620
Like, I don't get it.

00:31:05.159 --> 00:31:09.149
I didn't even understand and comprehend
that God's knowledge is greater than our

00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:14.250
knowledge, and I believe God is aligning
what he's had all, all along with us

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.230
and our next location at the Y M C A.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.610
I think he is.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.409
How do I see that?

00:31:20.639 --> 00:31:27.510
By, by realizing that looking
back, God has been aligning this

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:31.110
up forever, but I've just, I
was counseling the wrong people.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.850
I was searching the wrong things.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:36.449
And even in that searching, maybe there
was a good heart at times, but most of the

00:31:36.449 --> 00:31:38.909
time I was coming back to my own heart.

00:31:39.199 --> 00:31:41.699
So I'm just giving you a practical
example because I want you guys

00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:45.000
to just make fun of me and make,
you know, make me the bad guy.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.889
But I know you guys probably
struggled with some of that.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.750
So my hope is that when we look at
this and we think about how wonderful

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:58.980
the counselor of Jesus is, that we
will not go another day or another

00:31:58.985 --> 00:32:01.350
moment before we counsel the Lord.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.440
Lord, what is it that
you have planned for me?

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:09.810
Here's the cool part in God's
wonderful counsel in sending Jesus,

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:13.530
did you know that he knew you would
be here in this moment and this

00:32:13.535 --> 00:32:16.230
day with this breath and this life?

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:16.950
He did.

00:32:18.165 --> 00:32:21.555
And you know what he's saying in
this moment, in this breath and in

00:32:21.555 --> 00:32:26.775
this message, you and me need to hear
that he is a wonderful counselor.

00:32:26.925 --> 00:32:32.955
That he wants to guide and direct our
lives according to his plan, which as

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.575
we learn more and more and more, God's
plan is greater than ours, guaranteed.

00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:38.505
100%.

00:32:38.505 --> 00:32:38.925
Why?

00:32:39.705 --> 00:32:41.235
Because he's a wonderful counselor.

00:32:41.235 --> 00:32:44.295
He ha he has the ability and
knowledge of way more than.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:50.730
He has plans that are way greater
than I'll ever fulfill on my own.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.420
But you know what happens?

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.710
Tomorrow is gonna be another
day for me to get distracted

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.080
because there's so much going.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:04.500
And I'm used to, I'm a routine person.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.130
I'm used to counseling myself
or going to other things.

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:12.990
So I've gotta reorient my brain and my
life around the understanding that God has

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.180
sent Jesus to be a wonderful counselor.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.250
He's better than our parents.

00:33:17.255 --> 00:33:18.090
He's better than Google.

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.380
He's better than a dictionary.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.710
And just so you know, if we didn't
mention this, he's better than Facebook.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.370
This fact checkers doesn't work
every time, just so you know.

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:27.360
Doesn't work.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.300
So think about this, Jesus.

00:33:31.245 --> 00:33:34.034
Was sent with the idea to
guide and direct our lives.

00:33:34.725 --> 00:33:36.284
God has given us this resource.

00:33:36.705 --> 00:33:38.595
So I wanna ask, I I want to ask this.

00:33:38.865 --> 00:33:40.365
I know I don't have to ask this question.

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:42.105
I know everybody in here's
got a cell phone, right?

00:33:43.245 --> 00:33:43.605
Great.

00:33:43.695 --> 00:33:43.935
Okay.

00:33:43.965 --> 00:33:45.014
Majority of it's got a cell phone.

00:33:45.705 --> 00:33:50.205
Um, do you think that you use that
phone to its best capabilities?

00:33:50.565 --> 00:33:51.465
Raise your hand if you do.

00:33:51.495 --> 00:33:52.245
Now, some of you may.

00:33:52.425 --> 00:33:55.395
Do you use it to its best
capabilities that it was designed for?

00:33:57.554 --> 00:33:57.615
No.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:33:59.939
Most of us don't.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.740
Maybe Orville, he's, no.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:01.979
Okay.

00:34:01.979 --> 00:34:02.490
Not even Orville.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:02.729
Okay.

00:34:04.379 --> 00:34:08.489
Um, and here, let me just tell you,
like, I, I have a phone that I think

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:12.929
I just text and email and phone call
occasionally and, and I don't have the

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:15.960
apps I don't even use, like, I don't, I
don't use it to its best capabilities.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.770
Well, that's simple technology, but
I want us to think about it this way.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:25.529
Jesus is an untapped resource
that we have on hand every day.

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:30.360
That we're using very least capabilities.

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:32.700
We know he is there as our savior.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:34.320
He'll get us into heaven.

00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:37.800
I know, I know.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.330
You know, he, he loves me.

00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:41.760
Well, I know.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.580
You know, so like we, we, we bring
it down to the basics level and

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.320
we use email and we use texting.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.040
We use phone call.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.980
We use our relationship with Jesus
as the basics and we're good.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.200
But God is sitting here saying this.

00:34:53.355 --> 00:34:54.465
Have you heard about my council?

00:34:54.465 --> 00:34:55.695
Like that's an upgrade.

00:34:56.475 --> 00:34:59.654
Have you heard about how
much more I have for you?

00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:04.065
If you would just spend some time
with me, if you would just understand.

00:35:04.065 --> 00:35:05.685
My council is amazing.

00:35:06.345 --> 00:35:09.735
So I think this way too many of
us claim faith in Jesus and never

00:35:09.735 --> 00:35:11.025
experience him to the fullest.

00:35:11.475 --> 00:35:15.325
Too many of us claim faith in Jesus, but
we never experience him to the fullest.

00:35:16.805 --> 00:35:20.595
Jesus is not something we just buy
put on our shelf to look pretty.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.470
I'll put it this way.

00:35:22.799 --> 00:35:25.319
He was also not made to
be an insurance plan.

00:35:25.319 --> 00:35:26.460
I started thinking through this.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.930
I think sometimes we treat
our relationship with

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.130
Jesus as an insurance plan.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:30.480
It's a life insurance plan.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.190
What happens to the life insurance plan?

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:33.990
It gets paid out when you're dead.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.509
And that's why we keep it.

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:38.700
That's what we're hoping for.

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.100
Does that not fit in with
our faith these days?

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.020
Sometimes it's gonna get paid out.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:43.770
I'm gonna go to heaven.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.630
That's all I need Jesus for.

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.210
And it's like, oh man.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:50.339
Like that sticks in me
when I started thinking.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.550
Jesus is more than an insurance plan.

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:55.830
Jesus is my savior.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.140
Jesus is a wonderful counselor.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.180
Jesus is a mighty God.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.190
Jesus is an eternal father.

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:04.440
Jesus is a prince of peace.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:09.210
See, he is so many things, and
that's why as you begin to study

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:13.860
God's word, you'll see more and
more names for God or for Jesus.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:14.700
Why?

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:18.870
So that we can relate to Him, so
that we can understand how he.

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:21.960
It's a part of our life.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.280
And, and I think we can even do that with
each other as we begin to think about,

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:30.810
you know, I don't just have a wife, but
I have someone who loves me and cares

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:33.750
for me and, and long suffering for me.

00:36:33.755 --> 00:36:37.260
And there's so many different words you
could use for the way in which she shows

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.970
her affection or she relates to me.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.910
And those are important for
me to know because that's how

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:43.290
much I know she cares for me.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.460
It's not just because she's my.

00:36:45.705 --> 00:36:49.905
It's not just because he's my savior, but
there's these names that helps us know

00:36:50.085 --> 00:36:52.245
the layers and the many layers of God.

00:36:52.485 --> 00:36:54.465
Why is it important for us to know this?

00:36:55.005 --> 00:36:58.725
Because if we don't understand
this, just like our phones, we'll

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:00.615
experience God's best for us.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:05.129
Very little because we only get to
experience a little portion of it because

00:37:05.129 --> 00:37:06.569
we don't know how the rest of it works.

00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:11.879
So God is drawing us in during the
season of Christmas to remember why

00:37:11.879 --> 00:37:13.919
he came to save us from our sins.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.819
But to remember that he came to give us
more than to just salvation from our sins.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.980
He gave us hope.

00:37:20.759 --> 00:37:22.379
He gave us love.

00:37:22.649 --> 00:37:26.910
He gave us guidance and
direction and faith and mercy.

00:37:29.925 --> 00:37:35.655
And I think more and more about this
every day, how I miss it because I

00:37:35.655 --> 00:37:38.385
don't recognize God in those areas.

00:37:39.255 --> 00:37:41.265
See, I think that's why
it's important to remember.

00:37:41.745 --> 00:37:48.285
Remember that we have God through Jesus
in our lives, to counsel us to, to

00:37:48.285 --> 00:37:49.995
be the greatest gift in this season.

00:37:51.044 --> 00:37:53.805
To help us in our lives and our
marriages and our kids and in our

00:37:53.805 --> 00:37:57.555
finances during stress and death
and decisions and purity and health.

00:37:57.825 --> 00:37:58.665
You name it.

00:37:58.995 --> 00:38:01.605
God is a wonderful counselor.

00:38:01.845 --> 00:38:02.955
He is a mighty God.

00:38:03.395 --> 00:38:04.665
He is the princip of peace.

00:38:05.205 --> 00:38:06.285
He is an eternal father.

00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:10.995
And my hope today is we think through
this and I know it gave you a lot

00:38:10.995 --> 00:38:14.504
of background on the front end, and
as we finish up today that we can

00:38:14.504 --> 00:38:19.095
take this one or two words, I guess
it is, and think on it this week.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.299
Think on it, meditate on it.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:28.049
Think about how his wonder and how
wonderful he is and how he is a counselor

00:38:28.049 --> 00:38:34.620
and a guider in your life, and maybe this
is for you to think, how often do you

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:39.299
go to him for counsel just on the day to
day basis, or how often do you set him

00:38:39.299 --> 00:38:42.180
on a shelf and not figuratively, right?

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.170
Figuratively, not literally.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:48.270
You set him on a shelf and you
come to him in desperate times.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:50.310
Oh man.

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:51.420
Now there's a financial struggle.

00:38:51.569 --> 00:38:52.440
Oh God, help me.

00:38:53.279 --> 00:38:59.970
What if God wants to counsel what you do
tomorrow in your job and in your home?

00:39:01.049 --> 00:39:05.160
What if God wants to show you above
and beyond anything you could imagine

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:09.900
in your life this next week as you
gather around friends, as you go

00:39:09.904 --> 00:39:11.490
about the activities in your life?

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:15.930
What if God wants you to experience that?

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:16.740
I think he.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.590
I think he wants all of
us to experience that.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:23.430
So all the things we do during this
Christmas season can easily distract

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:27.720
us from the true reason of why we
celebrate it in the first place.

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:32.070
Everything we do to celebrate during
the season should flow out of our

00:39:32.075 --> 00:39:35.700
relationships with Jesus and our
knowledge of understanding the gift

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.610
that he has given us is so much
greater than anything else we can have.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.220
So there's more in this passage
we're gonna go through next

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.870
week, we'll dive more into.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:47.640
But I think that we can take a few
things with us, and I think this time

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.200
of invitation allows us to do that.

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:51.480
I, I, I try to explain this every week.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.080
Invitation can become redundant.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:57.210
It can become something that we just
close our eyes and we do whatever

00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:01.260
the pastor says, and we, we may
worship a little bit at the end,

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.200
and then we high five everybody
and head home and eat some lunch.

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:08.310
Maybe that's not you, but I know
this, and this is why I do this.

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:11.430
I do not want you to get in the
routine of doing the same thing

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:12.420
every week that we have in.

00:40:13.335 --> 00:40:17.355
I want you to seriously, I'm going
to do the same thing back there.

00:40:17.355 --> 00:40:17.865
That's what I do.

00:40:17.865 --> 00:40:21.135
I start considering, what
did God speak to you about?

00:40:21.255 --> 00:40:22.755
I know there was a lot today.

00:40:23.295 --> 00:40:24.555
What did God speak to you about?

00:40:25.095 --> 00:40:29.235
How can you take his wonderful counsel
and begin to apply it into your life?

00:40:29.505 --> 00:40:31.715
How can you take this Christmas season?

00:40:32.145 --> 00:40:33.255
I'm just giving you some waste.

00:40:33.525 --> 00:40:38.385
I can take this Christmas season
and reorient it around the story of

00:40:38.655 --> 00:40:41.325
who Jesus is and why he came not.

00:40:42.135 --> 00:40:43.125
All the other things.

00:40:44.085 --> 00:40:46.695
For some of you, maybe it's just
a, a relationship with Jesus.

00:40:46.695 --> 00:40:50.385
If you haven't given your life to Jesus,
that's where it starts because you can't

00:40:50.385 --> 00:40:53.565
receive this wonderful counsel until
you actually have God living inside you.

00:40:53.565 --> 00:40:54.345
How do you do that?

00:40:54.675 --> 00:40:58.395
By repeating up your sins and turning to
Jesus and saying, yes, Lord, I need you.

00:40:59.145 --> 00:41:03.255
I would love to talk to you more
about that if you have questions, but

00:41:03.555 --> 00:41:05.955
maybe this last thing that you need
to pray and this is what I'm gonna.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:11.310
Pray and ask God to remind you that he
is a wonderful counselor, that he is

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:15.090
ready to guide and direct your life, to
fulfill his work in your life and the

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:17.580
life of others to experience his best.

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:22.800
That's what I, I'm, I'm, I'm just,
I want to be as honest as I can.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.990
I don't just preach messages.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.610
These messages literally fill
me and they challenge me.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:34.200
I don't feel like I've done a great
job of seeking his wonderful counsel.

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:38.550
And I am repenting in these seasons
and asking God to help me do that.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:39.930
That's my challenge to you.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.240
I don't wanna challenge you to
do anything that I'm not doing.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.960
God is greater than anything that we have.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:50.490
May we cherish him as our precious
gift during this time of Christmas.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:55.050
May God challenge you during this time
of invitation to reflect on how you apply

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:56.520
his wonderful counsel to your lives.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:57.150
Let's pray.

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:58.380
Lord Jesus, we love you.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:41:59.310
God.

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:00.360
We are so thankful.

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:04.905
For your word, even though it
is vast Lord for your word, even

00:42:04.905 --> 00:42:08.595
though sometimes it's difficult to
understand, Lord, we're thankful for it.

00:42:09.285 --> 00:42:13.845
And Lord, as we reflect on the book of
Isaiah and all the prophecies that he

00:42:14.025 --> 00:42:17.535
prophesied about, Lord, we are coming to
this point where he prophesied about a

00:42:17.865 --> 00:42:24.945
coming savior one Lord, that the tribe of,
uh, Judah Lord didn't fully comprehend.

00:42:24.945 --> 00:42:27.555
And Lord, we don't fully comprehend,
even though we've seen Jesus.

00:42:29.085 --> 00:42:35.265
Well, Lord, we're reflecting today
to remember why you sent him and,

00:42:35.415 --> 00:42:40.875
and you sent him to be a wonderful
counselor for every one of us.

00:42:41.715 --> 00:42:49.875
God, I pray that we have learned
today that Jesus can help us.

00:42:49.875 --> 00:42:53.985
Jesus can be our
counselor in time of need.

00:42:53.985 --> 00:42:56.295
He can be our counselor every
day in everyday decision.

00:42:57.165 --> 00:42:59.984
He can guide and direct our lives
when it's difficult and when

00:42:59.984 --> 00:43:05.115
it's easy, that he can remind
us of who he is and why he came.

00:43:05.805 --> 00:43:11.475
And Lord, he can also remind us Lord
of our purpose, that we are not here

00:43:11.475 --> 00:43:15.705
with breath in our lungs just for
ourselves, but for the sake of others

00:43:15.705 --> 00:43:19.964
who don't know you, God, may you begin
to put a burden on our hearts for

00:43:19.964 --> 00:43:24.375
those around us who don't know you, and
begin to invite them in to experience.

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:29.640
God, you are so good and
you have changed our lives.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.359
And Lord, we do.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.399
We want others to
experience that same thing.

00:43:33.299 --> 00:43:36.299
So Lord, help each one of us open
our hearts and our minds today during

00:43:36.299 --> 00:43:42.210
an invitation to repent or to just
Lord, remember what you've done for

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:45.810
us and to guide direct our lives
in this season ahead, the Lord.

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:46.830
We pray this in your heavenly name.

00:43:47.609 --> 00:43:47.970
Amen.
