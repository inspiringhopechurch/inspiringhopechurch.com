00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.920
on a sunday morning we miss the greatest 
thing that god has for us he says he  

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.680
we are to come together um and 
build relationships build community  

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.840
and so that's why we love giving that space 
um between kind of the kids transitioning out  

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.480
and the start of being able to walk through god's 
word so i hope you guys enjoyed that i hope you  

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.840
got to meet somebody new and connect with them 
um but excited today we're going to continue  

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.480
in the book of ephesians we're going to be in 
ephesians chapter six uh starting in verse four  

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.040
and i don't know did you end up having 
the other three verses or not okay don't  

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.640
worry about it then we're good so we'll be in 
verse four um if you don't have a bible with  

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.960
you here's my encouragement number one we do 
have a bible back here on our next steps table  

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.200
you can go get one now you can take one home with 
you that's our free gift to you if you do not have  

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.640
a bible app i encourage you to get one i love the 
youversion bible app it's something that i use  

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.520
each and every week it allows me to take my bible 
with me on my phone go through devotionals things  

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.600
like that and so that's just an encouragement to 
you if you don't have a copy of god's word it can  

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.000
go with you wherever you go it is free so i 
would love for you to turn there if you have  

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.400
ephesians chapter six verse four um so 
what we've been doing is we've been walking  

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.760
through the book of ephesians since about 
january i think most of us have probably  

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.040
remembered that we started in january and 
we've kind of stopped here there with a few  

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.160
other messages but what we've learned in the book 
of ephesians is really all that god has done for  

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.880
us the first three chapters talks about all that 
god has done for us he's chose us he loves us he  

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.600
adopted us he saved us he gave us the holy spirit 
he's given us the power to live a life worthy of  

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.280
the gospel he's given us all these things and 
because of all that god has done for us we've  

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.840
learned over the last couple of chapters we should 
walk then worthy of the calling that god has given  

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.080
us because all that god's done for us we should 
walk worthy of our calling as followers of jesus  

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.760
and so we're going to continue that theme really 
through today through what it looks like for a  

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.480
father to walk in his faith based upon what god 
has done for him he should live that out in the  

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.760
life of being a father and no i didn't plan for 
this text on this day it just literally happened  

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.840
to plan out this way and so i'm i'm always 
glad whenever god does that he'll just kind of  

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.000
drop a text in and it fits on father's day so um 
here's just an encouragement if you are a mother  

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.120
in the room or you haven't had kids yet and you're 
wondering hey does this apply to me this can apply  

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.840
to you yes absolutely i think this is also not 
just the father's responsibility but the mother's  

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.480
responsibility or the future responsibility if 
you're a grandparent how you can help raise kids  

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.760
right and so i think that's so important for us 
but i want to start off by asking this question  

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.960
dads grandparents do you want to make a difference 
in your kids life or your future kids life yes i  

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.880
would hope so you want to make a major impact that 
it will change their life not only for eternity  

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.320
but to change their life as to when they become 
adults that they'll be successful not only at life  

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.360
but really even just as a christ follower and so 
i would say all of us would want that right but  

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.800
let me ask this question have um you and again 
the group this size i know there's gonna be some  

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.240
that would say hey it's a negative but have you 
been influenced by your father in a positive or  

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.360
negative way in your life yes no i mean i would 
say this and i know that right there should  

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.480
be everybody raising their hands the answer is 
fathers make an impact positively or negatively  

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.080
in everyone's life in some way of their absence 
or their presence and what we're going to learn  

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.360
today is the important role of the father in the 
home and just to even say this the important role  

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.240
of the father in the church if you do a little bit 
of research a mother that comes to faith in christ  

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.600
will actually get her family to come to church 
and come to faith in christ 17 of the time but a  

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.840
father that comes to faith in christ will actually 
get his family to church and to salvation 93  

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.240
of the time so fathers lead the charge when it 
comes from a spiritual relationship with jesus  

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.080
here's just another thought as i was reading 
about this is children who live absent from  

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.760
their biological fathers on average are more 
likely to be poor experience educational health  

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.120
emotional and psychological problems be victims 
of child abuse and engage in criminal behavior  

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.400
more than their peers who lived with a married 
biological mother and father and so that's  

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.160
not to say just so you know when you hear this 
this is not to say if you're living in a split  

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.680
home or if you're living in a home who has had 
separation in it that it is bad what i'm saying is  

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.800
that it is an important role for the father 
to play it's the important role the father  

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.040
if you're a stepfather or maybe you're a single 
parent don't don't hear what i'm not saying you  

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.600
have an important role as well but it's just 
this understanding that when we do research we  

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.680
know that the father plays an important role this 
this ministry here pathway has a father service  

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.480
and what that is is to help these fathers who have 
uh basically had a child that they didn't expect  

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.920
and now they're trying to figure out how to 
be a father and they have somebody who who is  

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.120
by the name of warren that walks with them to 
learn how to be a godly father and i love that  

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.960
because again they recognize the important role of 
the father and so we will learn a little bit more  

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:20.640
about that today and my hope is dads that you will 
look at this as not a weight of hey man i've got  

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.680
an important role but it's an opportunity you know 
i i'm telling you this i'm a guy that looks at a  

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.440
lot of things in life as a glass half empty i know 
that's bad i should be a positive guy all the time  

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.920
but what that does is when i do that it puts 
pressure on me whenever i look at things as  

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.800
an opportunity class half full um it changes 
my perspective so today i hope that you'll  

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.840
you'll listen into this text you'll see as an 
opportunity to be a better father better example  

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.240
and again this really applies to everybody uh when 
we talk about this as well so you'll get something  

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.120
out of it but paul is talking directly to christ 
waller sophia is talking about a father in this  

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.120
example it does take somebody giving their lives 
to christ first before they can live this way  

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.240
i think when we tried to be a great father a great 
parent or a great aunt or uncle or grandparent  

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.880
apart from relationship with jesus we're 
missing the key part to be successful in that  

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.080
and so i hope that you'll kind of hear that 
in this that it's so important for us to know  

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.280
that so let's look at this scripture rather than 
continue to hear me just talk about it let's let's  

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:30.000
jump in and see what god's word says so it says in 
ephesians chapter 6 verse 4 it says fathers don't  

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.080
stir up anger in your children but bring them 
up in the training and instruction of the lord  

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.560
so there's a lot in this one verse um a lot 
we don't want to miss the keys to it so the  

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.840
first thing here is paul is describing several 
responsibility a father has towards their children  

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.000
in order to make a lasting impact again as fathers 
as mothers as parents if we want to make a lasting  

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.320
impact on our kids to see them be successful in 
life not just in the worldly way but in a godly  

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.040
way these are key things so i hope that you lean 
in and you say i want to hear this because there's  

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.640
something here so the first one is he must not 
promote or provoke them and so we'll see this kind  

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.920
of at the beginning paul says do not stir up anger 
in your children and so we just got done last week  

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.240
dealing with these verses children obey 
your parents in the lord for this is right  

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.600
right honor them and so we see the kids 
responsibility but it's also the father's  

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.080
responsibility to not provoke their children 
to anger to provoke them to disobeying  

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:37.040
and things like that and so this is where paul 
is getting at and so colossians 3 21 says this so  

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.440
you'll learn a lot about colossians as 
really ephesians and colossians could be read  

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.520
right alongside each other because they speak a 
lot to the same things and it says this fathers  

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:52.320
do not exasperate your children so that they won't 
become discouraged and so we see the opposite of  

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.880
provoking your children is to encourage your 
children so that makes sense right as fathers  

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.120
as parents we should want to encourage our 
children we shouldn't want to provoke them  

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.280
and cause them to be stirred up and anger so look 
this is where the part where i love getting you  

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.560
guys engaged in this conversation let's talk 
about this what are some ways we can or we do  

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:19.200
sometimes discourage kids or maybe when you were 
a kid what were some ways in which your parents  

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:28.560
discouraged you accomplishments 
you got an a and they're like eh  

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.160
could have made an a plus 
okay it's a good one what else

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.720
what are some ways that parents can 
discourage their children or maybe  

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.680
you were discouraged as a child by your parents

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.600
picking on them yeah yep yep absolutely

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.960
anybody else want to jump in there

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:13.040
expecting perfection yeah you don't expect that of 
yourself though right yeah see i think this this  

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.960
text was hard for me because what it does and i 
share this with you guys a lot when i'm preparing  

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:22.160
a text to share on sundays god rakes me over the 
coals first and then i get to share it so i'm like  

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.800
man what are some things that i've discouraged 
my kids with and so here's a couple of things  

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.560
that i came up with by saying one thing and doing 
another you ever had parents say do what i say not  

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:37.600
what i do that's discouraging to a child because 
you're saying one thing but you're doing something  

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:43.360
different and it just doesn't reconcile and 
adults you know this if you're in the job force  

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.320
and your boss says one thing and he does another 
that frustrates you right so we get that idea of  

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.680
that right by always blaming and never encouraging 
right so it's you know not being so we're talking  

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.120
about perfection right being critical by 
being inconsistent and unfair and disciplined  

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.040
um this is a fun one and we'll 
get to this a little bit more is  

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:11.120
uh there's times where you discipline them for 
this for one thing so okay they didn't obey you  

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.160
by you know listening to you the first time 
but then the next time you don't even punish  

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.560
them they they ask like nine times and you just 
tell them stop asking right so like inconsistency  

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.600
discourages a child because they don't 
understand the boundaries um here's another  

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.240
one tough for dads i've been there before making 
promises and not following through with them  

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.240
making promises and not falling through them so 
we see those are things that discourage our kids  

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.680
they're things in which causes them to have again 
as a child they're learning they're developing  

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.840
this new understanding of what it is to follow 
their parents and we can discourage them in that  

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.600
right we want them to obey us but we aren't 
being consistent and sometimes the way we say  

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.960
and how we act so an example for me 
is i have a high expectation of myself  

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.880
and because of that i tend to apply that to every 
other person including my family so you go back to  

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:09.440
this perfection right is my kids will do something 
really well but it won't be perfect and i'm going  

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.200
to talk about the thing in which they didn't 
do perfect rather than what they did well um  

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.240
and again it's not telling your kids they should 
be shouldn't be better because we want them to  

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.200
be better but it's being critical first and then 
not even talking about the the good because i mean  

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.480
honestly you guys know this if somebody comes in 
and they're like man you could have done a little  

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.920
better but good job you don't even hear the good 
job you hear they think i'm not good enough and so  

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.720
that for me was just a reminder i don't do that 
here's here's another one is your tone matters  

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:42.800
um not only are words important but our tone right 
when we talk to our kids and i know brittany's not  

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:49.440
in here but one of the things that i've learned 
with brittany is as a child for her her dad the  

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.800
way he would yell it wouldn't be the words he 
said i mean like he could say whatever she's like  

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:59.680
that never bothered me his tone that discouraged 
her she would shut down and so that affects kids  

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:06.480
and how you are disciplining them and so we see 
again talking about this is that he's describing  

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.360
again several responsibilities for fathers but 
i would even say his parents um towards their  

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.840
children is again to make it lasting in pakistan 
to not provoke them but then the second thing we  

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.480
see is to to nurture them and so this is kind of 
where we see this it says do not stir up anger in  

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.440
your children but bring them up in training 
and so to bring them up is to nurture them  

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.960
and so whenever you think about fathers sometimes 
fathers are not nurturing and that sounds like  

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.840
motherly right that sounds like motherly but as 
fathers we should do that here's what a father  

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:42.160
typically says well i'm nurturing my child because 
i provided food i'd shelter and a place to sleep  

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.040
isn't that enough i mean that's the dad's 
responsibility i go to work i pay the bills  

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.480
i'm good enough the answer is that's not 
good enough because really what you're  

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.040
doing is you're providing a need but you're not 
providing the emotional and spiritual leadership  

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.560
that god's designed you to give you provide the 
physical but not the emotional and the spiritual

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:10.960
so dad's um what can we do here's here's this is 
where i'm hoping and and moms you can voice into  

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.880
this grandparents you can voice in this future 
appearance whatever you are in this room you  

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.960
can answer this question what would it look like 
for you to encourage your children emotionally  

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.600
and spiritually or what does it look like 
maybe you do it what does it look like  

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.840
pray with him that's great what else

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.320
grow yourself right so if you 
prioritize your relationship with jesus  

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.400
you're actually prioritizing your kids because 
you're setting an example it's good what else

00:13:53.040 --> 00:14:02.000
yes pokemon oh my gosh it is a craze and 
i don't know how many times my son wants  

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.960
to tell me about it and there's sometimes i 
just don't want to hear about it but i'm like  

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.840
you know what son tell me all about charm 
mander whatever you're i don't even know  

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.760
i know pikachu okay it's okay um so yes 
care about what they care about i don't  

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.040
know my daughter's been dancing since she 
was three she loves showing me her dances  

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.560
and so it's just me putting on my phone 
it's it's me getting away from tv or  

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.840
my conversation with brittany and saying yeah show 
me it's caring that's great i love that what else

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.800
i i did this the other day i went to target 
simple 10 minute trip for us because it's right  

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.880
across the road and i asked tegan to go with me 
we rode in the car and we just talked about life  

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.640
that's all we did just spent time with her right 
and so there's so many things as a father we think  

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:00.720
about a father's figure in this we tend to pass 
off the emotional to the mother the nurturing  

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.680
we pass off the spiritual to the youth pastor 
and the children's minister just being honest  

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.440
anybody ever get dropped off to youth ministry 
or children's ministry as a kid and your parents  

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.880
went home or went grocery shopping i would 
tell you the last church i was at in oklahoma  

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.000
i would say 60 to 70 percent of 
the parents never went to church  

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:25.840
but the kids did so what they were doing was they 
were saying do what i say not what i so one of the  

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:31.840
greatest ways a father can lead spiritually 
and emotionally is actually lead by example  

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:37.440
right coming back to following jesus by example 
and so again he's saying to nurture them and so  

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.320
um nowhere in the bible this is an 
encouragement nowhere in the bible does the  

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.880
outsourcing of the child's spiritual relationship 
with jesus passed on to anybody else but the  

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:54.080
parents here's a great example deuteronomy 6 6-7 
says these words that i am giving you today are to  

00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:00.400
be in your heart repeat them to your children talk 
about them when you sit in your house and when you  

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:06.880
walk along the road and when you lie down and when 
you get up so the question is moms dads are we  

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.360
bringing our children up and training and 
instruction like the lord is saying and so  

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.400
here's just some examples from this text this is 
i just kind of took this text and i said okay what  

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.880
would this look like this deuteronomy text what 
would it look like in our life so it says first  

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:25.440
we are to have the words on our heart so that 
means dads moms follow jesus they gotta be in  

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:32.000
you first if you expect your kids to follow jesus 
if you expect your kids to act right and obey  

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.840
you you need to start by following jesus obeying 
your father in heaven setting the example  

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.800
so they need to be on your heart the words need to 
be on your heart number two it says that you are  

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.120
to repeat them to your children so you will repeat 
to your children what you're learning share how to  

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.080
follow jesus consistently talk to them and that's 
where it says here talk about them everywhere you  

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.720
go and i love this talk about them when you sit 
in your house and when you walk along the road  

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:05.120
everywhere you go talking about the 
elements of jesus the air the trees creation  

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:12.240
why you chose to not flip the person off 
that cuts you off okay setting the example by  

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.120
talking to them about these things wherever 
you go here's the last one i love this it  

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.960
says when you lie down and when you wake up 
parents the greatest way to be an influence  

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.520
emotionally and spiritually in your kids 
lives is setting the pace in the morning  

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.120
spiritually with him prioritizing god time 
with him prioritizing praying with him but  

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.680
also in the evenings evenings are my favorite 
time listen to the kids fridays and saturdays  

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.200
this is what we do before prayer time this is 
how we decide who prays rock paper scissors  

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.320
they love it rock paper scissors we all play it 
now sterling if he was in here i'm telling you  

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.680
this kid has to play rock paper scissors with 
us all he used to he always do scissors and he  

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.040
always got beat but he's starting to change 
and last night he won three or four times so  

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:58.080
the point is they love that emotional time five 
ten minutes and they love to pray well how did  

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.160
they learn how to pray well i started my youngest 
son doesn't pray but the rest of them they do  

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.360
and they're praying their own words and what god 
lays on their heart how do we do that because we  

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.480
started that when my daughter was three my oldest 
daughter she's now 12. so nights are so important  

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.000
so we talk about it in the mornings and we talk 
about in the evenings we talk about everywhere we  

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000
go but the only way we'll have the words to talk 
about with our kids is if it is in our heart and  

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.440
in our minds so i would like to say i'm i'm like 
man i'm knocking this out of the park as a dad  

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.040
but i'm going to give props to brittany and i'm 
gonna tell you that she and she's not in here  

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.880
but she's a living example of this and let me tell 
you how she's a living example of this so in the  

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.160
morning this is what you'll hear brittany she 
wakes up early before any of us she has to work  

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.000
in the morning she works usually somewhere between 
an hour and a half to two hours before most of us  

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.960
get up and go in the mornings as soon as she's 
done you know what she says i gotta have my jesus  

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.840
time life needs to happen right the kids probably 
need to get dressed or something else she says no  

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.280
i'm gonna go have my jesus time and she tells 
the kids that so she sits down and it may be  

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.720
five minutes some days sometimes it's 30. 
she has a jesus time you know she tells them  

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.080
hey you need to go have your jesus time i hear 
every morning you need to make sure you're  

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.240
either watching one of your your bible shows or 
you're getting it in your devotional so she makes  

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.080
sure they're doing that and she she says before 
anything else before you finish this she does it  

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:16.480
she's consistently i'm telling you i'll listen to 
her she's consistently sharing about who jesus is  

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.720
through their school through their daily 
activities she's disciplining them she's  

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:28.320
usually making sure that they understand that 
throughout that she also um has them follow her  

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.840
basically practical application i don't know how 
many times i've seen her use practical application  

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.560
in situations how she's dealing with things and so 
she's consistently doing that she encourages again  

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.280
them to start their day with jesus and so yes i 
would say i do have a part in that but i believe  

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.560
she has set the standard and it just reminded 
me i've got to up my game why because dads  

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.240
need to lead the charge dads don't need to leave 
the emotional and spiritual development of their  

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:58.560
kids to their mom only again so let me let me step 
out here if you are only parent if you're only a  

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.120
mom and there is no father present you have to be 
that for them and your heavenly father will help  

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.240
you do that so that's not to say oh gosh you're 
just what do you do but but it's saying if you do  

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.080
have a father and a home no matter what it is and 
grandparents if they don't have a father in home  

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:19.040
step into that role it matters they make a big 
impact whenever they lead the charge in this so  

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.760
again i think that was a deep one for me 
whenever i got into it so paul describes again  

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:29.840
these several responsibilities that he has for a 
father towards his children to not provoke them to  

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.000
nurture them and this is the fun one to discipline 
them dads you know you love disciplining right  

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.760
i remember my grandpa my dad too i remember my 
grandpa would always threaten us with now he  

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.360
never used it on us he'd just threaten us with 
it but my grandpa would just pull it out and it  

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.040
was just in such a way he'd pull this belt out he 
never spanked us but his threat was good enough  

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:52.480
right it was the discipline my grandma would go 
to him to discipline why because he kind of set  

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:59.360
that standard but you ever had a parent or maybe 
you parents have done this before you ever avoided  

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.320
discipline you ever avoided disciplining your 
kids or your parents avoided disciplining you  

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:11.680
they would just kind of ignore you anybody yeah i 
do that sometimes with my kids right they're doing  

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:18.400
something i know is wrong but i just i'm too 
tired or here we go dad's mama take care of it  

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.040
and i'm learning this and sometimes i'll be 
like mama take care of it she's been dealing  

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.280
with it all day and dad needs to step in because 
again i think dad sets the standard with this  

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.920
um and so he says this in in the text here he says 
to bring them up in training and instruction and  

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:40.400
so this is where we talk about this bringing 
up um has to do with nurturing as well  

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:47.360
the idea of learning through discipline um and so 
even god does this this is just an encouragement  

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.600
to us even god does this hebrews 12 6 says this 
for the lord disciplines the one he loves and  

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.560
punishes every son he receives so if the lord our 
heavenly father disciplines us as followers of  

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:02.000
jesus we should discipline our kids and so this is 
just a and just a reminder we're not talking about  

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.160
beating your kids that's not what we're talking 
about we don't want to do that that is not right  

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.160
but discipline is in different forms it's 
helping them know what the difference between  

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.320
right and wrong difference between right and wrong 
that's why your heavenly father disciplines you  

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.480
he sees you on the wrong path he has something 
better for you as a parent this is what i remember  

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.840
i mean i've seen it happen before kids don't 
touch the stove it's hot what do they do they  

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.080
go and touch the stove they get burned and you 
look at that was that discipline well it's a  

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.200
learning experience because guess what they won't 
touch the stove again because they got burned  

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.320
well discipline's trying to prevent them from 
that burn and sometimes when they push through  

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.800
that discipline and they get in trouble or they 
get something that causes them to go this isn't  

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:45.440
right so we're actually helping our kids when we 
discipline them we're not hurting them that's the  

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:51.520
tough thing i mean you ever had your parents say 
it's going to hurt me more than it hurts you i  

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.320
didn't understand that concept until i became a 
parent but i realized it's important to follow  

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.920
through with discipline not ignore discipline as 
a father and think that i'm gonna take care of it

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.480
right way and i think that's what's 
important just a just a wise note  

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.800
if you're frustrated with your kids and 
you know you need to discipline them  

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.560
take time send them to the room right this is 
where we talk about we're not talking about  

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.480
abusing your child well we're talking about 
discipline then so don't just ignore them  

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.720
send them to the room take a deep breath ask the 
lord how to discipline them and discipline them  

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:33.680
um be protective of that because again dads go 
back to we're not supposed to stir them up in  

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:39.760
anger we're not supposed to treat them in a way 
that's not godly right and uh here here's just  

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:45.360
one last thing if if you think um you'll be better 
with the next child and you're not really taking  

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.640
care of the children you're not disciplining them 
well but the next child to do that that's actually  

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.240
a lie you typically discipline your second third 
fourth child less than you do your other ones  

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.840
we won we need to stop that we need to be 
consistent because that's important for  

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.400
the kids to see that right so 
just a reminder parents if you  

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.720
um lack and discipline your kids and they don't 
see that authority and respect your authority how  

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.440
are they supposed to respect their authority in 
heaven so when you're disciplining you you're  

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.640
actually helping them be able to respect god the 
father's relationship and their life in the future  

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.960
so we're supposed to not provoke them we're 
supposed to nurture them we're supposed  

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.520
to discipline them but here's the last one 
we're supposed to instruct and encourage them  

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:38.080
so train your child up in a way and instruct 
them in the lord and so it's more than actions  

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.040
it's also our words and so again as a kid i hated 
when my parents lectured me but parents don't stop  

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:53.040
lecturing your kids what does that mean don't 
stop telling them what it is the right thing  

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.400
to do because they need to hear that not only be 
shown that right i'm setting the example so 2nd  

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:05.600
timothy 3 16-17 reminds me of this all scripture 
is inspired by god and is profitable for teaching  

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.680
for rebuking for correcting and training in 
righteousness so the man of god may be complete  

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:14.960
equipped for every good work so as a father let's 
just look at this as an example as a father who's  

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:21.120
following after jesus who has the word of god 
in his heart needs to consistently not just say  

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.720
i'm living my life out for jesus my kids 
should follow me but to explain and share  

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:32.160
the word of god and train and instruct your kids 
it's it you're the one that leads by example um  

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:36.560
again don't expect somebody else to do it 
don't get don't wait till it's too late either  

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:45.200
your kids need it so we shouldn't um again 
think that it is someone else's job to train  

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.880
up but it is ours to do that but this is 
the second part i want us to look at is  

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.280
encourage them he says to instruct them 
training and instruct them but i still  

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.840
look at this encouragement what does 
it look like to encourage your kids  

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:07.280
um you are your kid's biggest hero parents 
grandparents you two my grandparents again  

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.840
i love my mom and dad and they impacted me 
as well but i was thinking my grandparents  

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:15.520
um some of the things they would say to me 
and believe in me made some of the greatest  

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.360
impacts in my life that i can reflect back to 
and i am the person i am today because of them  

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.600
i think about this when i say something 
in a way that encourages my kids  

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:32.640
i see a light bulb come on in them and they 
light up and you know what they see they see  

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:40.240
god in me and they see someone who loves and 
cares for them and i want to be that for them and  

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.280
i was just reminded in this and so let me just 
kind of share my share with my kids my kids um  

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:50.160
have so many different things that they believe 
god's gonna have them do whenever they get older  

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:56.240
um and so here's what it looks like for my 
daughter so my purpose as a father should be  

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.520
to help them discover their purpose for god 
and to really encourage them for that so my  

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.560
daughter peyton wants to grow up and she wants 
to be a dance teacher so what am i doing now  

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:12.720
to help her fulfill that passion for the glory 
of god let me show you what my son chanting and  

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.520
you'll love this one my son channing ever since 
i don't know seems like seven years old he wants  

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.400
to be an nfl player and a pastor and i kind of 
laughed it off for the longest time and that he  

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.640
just kept talking about it so what am i doing 
as a father to help him fulfill that call  

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:33.280
in a godly way that he can do it for the glory of 
god my daughter tegan she took this from my oldest  

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.880
daughter when she was younger but she wants to 
be a dolphin trainer which i'm like we're in ohio

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.400
but it's her dream at age seven and if you know 
my daughter tegan you may not have a ton of  

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:50.640
conversations with her she has compassion she will 
take up for every person that's getting picked on  

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.280
see that girl's got so much potential for the 
lord and what am i doing as a father to encourage  

00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:02.160
and help her fulfill her call to follow jesus my 
son sterling is only three but he loves his family  

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:07.200
and he's cute as all get out what am i doing 
to invest in my son let me just go outside of  

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:12.880
the kids my wife um you know what she tells me 
she says i just want to be a stay-at-home mom  

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.880
i want to homeschool my kids and she likes to 
invest in other ladies and she wants the space  

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:24.240
to do that what am i doing as a husband to allow 
her to fulfill that call guys let me let me tell  

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:30.640
you where it starts men fathers grandparents 
whoever you are in here it starts with you  

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:37.440
what are you doing to follow your call what 
are you doing to pursue your passion what god's  

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.840
called you to do to be a godly father to have a 
relationship with jesus to fulfill your passions  

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.320
because as you fulfilled your call in your life 
your kids will watch you they'll hear you and then  

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.040
you help them fulfill theirs one of my goals i put 
this down just i didn't plan to even share this

00:28:53.120 --> 00:29:00.960
one of my goals as a person okay what kind of 
stuff is what i believe is one of my passions  

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.360
is to help people discover really their purpose 
in their life right so we're a church just so you  

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.240
know our mission statement is to help people 
discover god's purpose for their life through  

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.560
relationship with jesus that's really just my life 
call it's just fleshed out through our church i  

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:18.400
really believe that's my life call so i have a 
goal to help 100 people fulfill their god-given  

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:23.200
purpose what does that look like it's by believing 
in them whenever they don't believe in themselves  

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:29.280
it's by by talking and speaking life into them 
and helping them find whatever god's called them  

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:34.480
to do and to go do it fan the flame that god 
has put inside of them parents why don't we do  

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:40.160
that for our kids god's called us men to lead 
the charge in that because they are the future  

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.920
of the gospel spreading they're the 
future of the church they're the future  

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:52.880
of really life in itself right and so what can we 
do to not miss that opportunity to encourage them  

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.400
to be the best they can we already 
talked about at the beginning right  

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.600
the great ways we discourage our kids why don't we 
change that around and start finding ways to ins  

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.680
encourage them and believe in them because they're 
going to have a lot of people in their life that  

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.840
discourage them and we shouldn't be one of 
them so let me kind of finish up this way  

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:17.680
and paul gives us several responsibilities to not 
provoke our children to nurture them to discipline  

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:24.400
them to instruct and encourage them and i'm hoping 
this does not discourage you right that weight  

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:29.840
maybe that you feel as a father as a parent as 
a grandparent whatever it is future parent i  

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.120
want you to know it should be exciting that it's 
given you the opportunity to raise the kids or  

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:40.960
your future kids or your grandkids or an impact 
whoever god's given you that you're here today  

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.320
because god says i have a purpose for you 
so what are you going to do to fulfill that  

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.360
it starts with a relationship with jesus 
and i you'll hear me say this every single  

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:58.080
week because i don't want you to miss this 
don't go try to live your life out without  

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:03.040
following jesus first we think we have to figure 
this out on our own but god's the only one that  

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:07.680
can give us the ability through his word through 
his spirit to live the way he's called us to live  

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:13.360
and really the way that i think we all desire 
to live so today if you haven't given your life  

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:19.040
to jesus i encourage you to do that what does that 
look like it means to confess that you have a need  

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.360
for jesus confess that you're not perfect that 
you need to turn from your sins the ways in  

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.720
which you weren't following god and to begin to 
follow him it sounds so simple but the answer is  

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:37.280
it is god didn't want to complicate what it took 
to follow him it just takes yes it takes yes  

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:43.040
so if you want to do that today i'd love for you 
to come and talk to me after service during our  

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.000
time of invitation you can come talk to me i'd 
love to talk to you about what it means to follow  

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.480
jesus but for those of you who would say i already 
have a relationship with jesus what does it mean  

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:56.000
then what is my my takeaway today is everything 
that was talked about whether it was to father  

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.440
specifically or anybody else we should take a way 
that we should help those around us encourage them  

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.840
not provoke them right discipline our children 
because it's good for them and instruct and  

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.640
encourage them as well and during this time 
of invitation i just want you to think through  

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.800
what would god have you do right because that's 
the thing i look across the room and i say this  

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.720
everybody has a different picture of what 
this looks like i've learned god's word  

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.880
speaks to me new every day and so maybe god's 
speaking you in a different way but during this  

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.240
time of invitation this is the time for you 
to reflect and say god what are you speaking  

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.960
to me about what is it that i need to apply 
to my life that i can take home from this  

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:44.160
because god has a word for you specifically 
and i pray that you consider that that you  

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:50.480
begin to apply that and if there's any way that 
i can help come talk to me because i want to be  

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.840
here for you to walk through that so let's 
pray lord jesus we love you lord and again

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.800
we're so thankful for your word 
because it's truth it's it's um  

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.600
it's convicting at times lord when i 
look at this text as a father myself  

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:12.080
of maybe the ways that i have not been encouraging 
lord but i've been spending more time discouraging  

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:19.040
my kids so lord can i be the first to 
say um lord that that i need forgiveness  

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.280
lord may i be the first to set the example 
that today i tell my kids that on the ride home

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.040
lord it is so important for us to remember lord 
that you are the heavenly father that sets the  

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:40.320
example of love unconditionally 
one that believes the best in us  

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:47.760
and is encouraging us to fulfill our call but 
lord may we be that today for our kids our  

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:54.240
grandkids our future kids to the people around 
us that we work with to our family members to  

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:59.520
our church members lord may we encourage not 
discourage that we build up not tear down

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.160
and uh lord may you get glory through all of it 
and lord i just pray if there's someone in this  

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:12.320
room that doesn't know you lord that if they want 
to to know you or they have questions about what  

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.800
it means to follow you through a relationship 
with you lord may they come and talk to me  

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.520
and not not put it off lord 
but that may they come and ask  

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.400
lord maybe there's someone in this room that's 
wondering what their next step is as a father  

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.800
as a parent as a follower of you lord i pray 
that they also come and ask because lord it's  

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.200
not that i have all the answers lord but i'm 
here to encourage them to to find those answers  

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.320
and uh lord i'm thankful for this church i'm 
thankful for this opportunity to open your word  

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:47.840
today and may it impact our lives lord for your 
glory and we pray this in your heavenly name amen
