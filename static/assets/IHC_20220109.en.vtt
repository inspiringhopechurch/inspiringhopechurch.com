00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.290
So typically I'm going to take a text and
I'm going to walk through it biblically.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:06.590
Right?

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.029
It's we typically walk through books.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.730
The Bible previously we've walked
through the book of Ephesians.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.050
We've walked through the book of Jonah.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.590
Um, we just got done with the
Christmas series, but today I

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.470
want it to take the opportunity
to do two things in this service.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.440
Number one, celebrate
all that God did in 2021.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.370
Even share a little bit of our story, our
journey, since we've started as inspiring.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.385
Um, and celebrate that.

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:30.115
Um, and then the second thing
I want to be able to do is cast

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:34.225
vision for where we believe God's
leading us in 20, 22 as a church.

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:37.315
And we're going to use God's
word to guide us in that.

00:00:37.315 --> 00:00:41.485
So what you guys should know about us, and
again, if you don't know us is everything

00:00:41.485 --> 00:00:43.405
we do is driven by the word of God.

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:47.575
We believe that it guides and directs how
we will live and how we will go about our

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:49.315
lives and how we'll serve as a church.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.555
And so you'll hear me reference
scriptures that will affirm that,

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:54.795
um, with, within who we are as.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.240
And in doing that.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.650
So again, unique today.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.210
Um, so come back next week.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.180
If you're, if you're saying, Hey, I'm
looking for a text, you know, where you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.370
walk through that scripture week by week?

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.060
Um, I will.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.480
So we'll be starting a first Timothy
next week and walking through that.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.880
Um, but today's just a
little bit unique in that.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.300
And so I want to start with just
a little bit about this year.

00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:18.945
This year coming up, I believe is
a critical year for us as a church.

00:01:19.244 --> 00:01:24.375
See, 20, 22 is really three years in the
making, um, three years in the making.

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:27.585
And let me share the reason why
that is three years ago, this

00:01:27.585 --> 00:01:29.324
month, me and my wife, Brittany.

00:01:29.684 --> 00:01:32.234
Um, and we only, well, we had
all four kids at that time.

00:01:32.264 --> 00:01:35.565
Uh, we synced as we were serving in
a church in Oklahoma, we sensed the

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:37.185
God was leading us to plant a church.

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:39.975
Um, and so we reached out to
an organization within our.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.950
The nomination to see what it
would look like to plant a church.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.280
And we started the journey three
years ago to say, Hey God, would

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.570
you call us to go plant a church?

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.490
And we lived in Oklahoma at that time.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.780
Little did we know that four months
later, uh, God would call us to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.600
plant a church here in Cincinnati.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.520
Later on in that year of
2019 to plant in Hamilton.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.020
Um, and so we took all of 2019,
really just ramping up of what it's

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.310
going to look like to plant a church.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.090
We cast that vision to families
in Oklahoma to come join

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.590
us and move here with us.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.100
And the cool part is a couple of
families moved with us from Oklahoma.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.180
To come here, um, in
2020 whenever they moved.

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.060
And so we transitioned out of Oklahoma in
2019, um, we fundraise, we sold our home.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.049
We did all these crazy things right
in a year of 2019 and left the day

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.130
after Christmas and landed here,
um, in Hamilton, uh, basically

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.320
the day after Christmas, 2019.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.120
And so you guys know
what happened in 2020.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.760
I mean, everything happened
in 2020 or what didn't happen.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.000
Right.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.180
And so 2020 was the year where
we came in as a church, I say,

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.530
as a church, as six people.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.740
Um, and we partnered with another church
called grace point in Springboro, um, to

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.540
just learn what church planting was like.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.810
And so we did a residency for a year
while we got to know our community.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.830
And as we got locked into our
home, as many of you did and

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.670
walked through, um, the life of
2020, but the cool part with 2020.

00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:06.185
Was this, the God began to build
relationships with people in their

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:09.725
community, within the church that
we were doing a residency with.

00:03:09.994 --> 00:03:12.545
Um, and then those families that
had committed to, to plant with

00:03:12.545 --> 00:03:13.894
us from Oklahoma moved here.

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:18.815
Um, and by the end of 2020, we had
a church that was meeting in my home

00:03:19.084 --> 00:03:21.185
on Wednesday nights of 30 people.

00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:22.954
So we went from six people.

00:03:22.984 --> 00:03:24.484
We moved here in 2000, 19 to 30.

00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:27.145
Uh, and the end of 2020.

00:03:27.145 --> 00:03:31.405
And so we launched out of that, uh, I
say launched data, but left that, uh,

00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:34.975
residency in 20, 20 and 2021 happened.

00:03:34.975 --> 00:03:35.185
Right.

00:03:35.185 --> 00:03:38.515
So 2021 for us was we
launched services in April.

00:03:38.965 --> 00:03:42.355
Um, and that's almost 10
months ago now, uh, with 36.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.240
And God has by his grace grown that
to almost double that size so that

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.590
people that we're ministering to.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.100
So over three years, we've seen
God do some amazing things.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.220
As we've been able to engage our city
through missions, as we've been able

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.730
to reach more people as we've been able
to gather together and celebrate what

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.260
God has done personally in our lives.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.460
This is one of the coolest things
to me as a church, as we have seen.

00:04:05.175 --> 00:04:08.745
Every person that has been a part
of this church grow in some form or

00:04:08.745 --> 00:04:12.315
fashion growing their relationship
with Christ growing and being involved.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:15.945
Um, it has been amazing to see so
many of you, uh, and the ways in

00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:17.024
which we've connected with you.

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:20.175
And by again, the grace of God, we've
seen him do some amazing things.

00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:21.704
And so we get to celebrate that, right?

00:04:21.704 --> 00:04:26.595
So really for us, as we look at 2022,
this is three years in the making

00:04:26.595 --> 00:04:28.005
in that three year seems to be.

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:31.815
So it's a short time I go, but whenever
I start thinking about it, it was

00:04:31.815 --> 00:04:33.615
a long journey to be where we are.

00:04:34.035 --> 00:04:37.905
So I say all that to say this, I
really believe that 2022 is critical.

00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:39.915
And again, if you're the first
time you're attending here going

00:04:39.915 --> 00:04:43.485
well, man, this is like a tough,
like this is a critical year.

00:04:43.755 --> 00:04:47.325
I believe it's critical because this, the
church is moving more and more away from

00:04:47.325 --> 00:04:48.975
a church that was started by one family.

00:04:49.425 --> 00:04:53.655
And is now a church that is led by
multiple families, which means this.

00:04:53.655 --> 00:04:55.045
Now the vision's not just my.

00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:58.215
And my wife's vision and the
vision that God gave us, but it's

00:04:58.215 --> 00:04:59.775
the vision that God's giving us.

00:05:00.164 --> 00:05:04.575
And as the doors God's opening, that means
it's, it's, it's part of all of us owning

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:08.325
that and being a part of growing, not
only the church, but really growing the

00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:09.645
kingdom of God as we talk about, right.

00:05:09.645 --> 00:05:12.974
The reach in our community, the reach
in our neighbors, um, neighborhoods

00:05:12.974 --> 00:05:15.315
and as well in our own lives.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:20.145
And so, um, something I want to share with
you guys, Um, is some defining verses that

00:05:20.145 --> 00:05:23.715
really have driven us as a church that
will continue to drive us as a church.

00:05:24.255 --> 00:05:27.105
Um, and again, if you want to, if you
have a buy with, you can pull these up

00:05:27.105 --> 00:05:29.865
and look at them and read them alongside,
I don't have them on the screen today.

00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:33.225
I'm a poor steward of doing
that, but I'll give them to you.

00:05:33.225 --> 00:05:38.205
So exit is 33 15 was a defining verse for
us as we started our journey three years

00:05:38.205 --> 00:05:42.105
ago, but it's going to continue to be a
defining verse going forward as a church.

00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:45.975
And this is Moses speaking to
God and he says, God, if your

00:05:45.975 --> 00:05:47.085
presence does not go with.

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:49.500
Do not send us up from here.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.250
And this was, you know, Moses really
telling God, Hey, we are willing to

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.060
go wherever you go, but we will not
move until your presence goes with us.

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.469
And every thing that we will do as
a church will pray that same prayer

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:02.849
and we'll pray that same verse.

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.010
And we'll say, God, we will
not go unless you go with.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.750
So Hebrews 11 six is another one that we
really had clean clung to as a church.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.190
And that is without faith.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.330
You cannot please.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.150
God, it's impossible to please
God, because anyone who comes to

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.800
him must believe he exists and he
rewards those who earnestly seek him.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.880
So we've talked a lot about faith
and so faith is not a hope so, right?

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.930
Faith is this.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.870
And this is something that
we've seen along this journey.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.300
Faith is seeing what God sees,
even though we don't know.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.530
Faith is seeing what God sees
you, but then we don't see it not.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.910
So let me explain that
a little bit further.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.420
Faith is seeing God and trusting that
God already sees what you desire to see.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.670
So I'll give you some examples today.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.630
Today, three years ago, when we made a
phone call and we said, Hey, we really

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.020
feel like God may be calling us to plant
a church in that moment of faith of

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.380
saying, Hey God, we're willing to step
out and go anywhere you want us to.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.390
And that moment we had faith in God.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.370
God was able to see what he sees.

00:07:00.525 --> 00:07:02.865
Uh, church, that's making a difference
in his community, a church that

00:07:02.865 --> 00:07:07.635
is growing together spiritually
relationally in ways that none of us

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:08.925
would have expected three years ago.

00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:12.825
See, today I get to physically
see what God saw three years ago.

00:07:12.825 --> 00:07:14.325
See that's faith three years ago.

00:07:14.685 --> 00:07:19.485
And so today I'm challenging you and I'm
challenging myself as this without faith.

00:07:19.485 --> 00:07:20.175
We can't please God.

00:07:20.175 --> 00:07:22.785
And we're going to continue to
have faith to see today what

00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:23.955
God is going to see a year from.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.610
And a year from now and a year from now.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.909
And the cool part is God is inviting
each one of us to be a part of that.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.860
Each one of us to be a part of it.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.750
And that's what leads
me to this next verse.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.390
Ephesians three 20 through 21 says now
to him, speaking of God, who is able

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:45.060
to do exceedingly abundantly above
all that we can ask or think according

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.780
to the power that works in us to him
be the glory in the church and Christ

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.250
Jesus to all generations forever.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.120
See, I love this version
of Ephesians 3 23, 21.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.800
It talks about exceedingly abundantly.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.830
And if you're anything like me,
those two words together are like

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.250
huge words, exceedingly abundantly
God desires to do exceedingly

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:08.350
abundantly more than we can ask or
think so it's a church going forward.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.160
We're going to continue to pray
that and believe that that God

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.490
can and will do exceedingly
abundantly more in and through us.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:15.760
Right.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.690
And this is where his.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:18.854
For his glory.

00:08:19.275 --> 00:08:21.825
And so we're going to continue
to do that as a church.

00:08:22.664 --> 00:08:26.565
Um, and so this is my prayer
as, as we go forward as 2022.

00:08:26.565 --> 00:08:29.025
And I'm gonna start sharing a little
bit about this with you is as the

00:08:29.025 --> 00:08:32.655
Lord's presence goes with this in 2022,
we believe that our faith will please

00:08:32.655 --> 00:08:36.375
God, as we follow him to see him do
exceedingly abundantly more than we

00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:39.824
can ask or think in the lives, our
lives and the lives of those around us.

00:08:40.934 --> 00:08:43.574
And so the question is as a
church, where are we heading?

00:08:43.664 --> 00:08:44.025
Right.

00:08:44.054 --> 00:08:45.314
What is next?

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.454
What is your part?

00:08:46.545 --> 00:08:49.605
That's the thing that I asked
myself, this question, where

00:08:49.605 --> 00:08:50.655
are we heading as a church?

00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:51.765
What's next?

00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:52.694
And what's your part?

00:08:52.995 --> 00:08:55.214
Well, this year we really
believe that God has called us.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.729
To do something where we'll focus
more on leadership development.

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:01.199
And so what does that mean?

00:09:01.199 --> 00:09:03.959
And I love to be able to explain this
because I believe that it's biblical

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:06.510
and I believe that it is something
that relates to each one of us.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.089
Um, and that's one of the reasons
why we're going through first

00:09:09.089 --> 00:09:11.670
and second Timothy this year
is first and second Timothy.

00:09:11.969 --> 00:09:14.130
We'll talk about leadership
for second Timothy.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.770
We'll talk about the last couple of
years of the apostle Paul's life.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.010
And he will give us, um, a lot
of wisdom on how we can do that.

00:09:20.815 --> 00:09:24.115
Um, and one of my favorite verses
from that is second Timothy, two two,

00:09:24.415 --> 00:09:27.775
where Paul says to Timothy, what you
have heard from me in the presence

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:31.795
of many witnesses, commit to faithful
men who will teach others also.

00:09:32.335 --> 00:09:36.025
And so that's our desire in 2022 is to
take what we have heard from the word

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:40.285
of God and commit them to faithful men
and women, to be able to teach others.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.730
And so the question is how are
we going to develop leaders?

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.560
How are we going to develop each one of us
into the leaders that lead other people?

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.490
Well, I'm not going to veer far
from who we are as a church.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.840
And so our mission as a church is
to inspire hope by helping people

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.660
discover God's purpose for their
life through relationship with Jesus.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.490
And we believe we fulfill that, right.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.860
We believe that every
person has a purpose.

00:10:05.595 --> 00:10:09.375
By God, divine by God now,
different gifts, different avenues.

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:11.205
Every one of you worked somewhere
different, lived somewhere

00:10:11.205 --> 00:10:13.575
different, has a different
number of kids or no kids, right?

00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:17.955
Every one of you has a purpose
this side of heaven, and we

00:10:17.955 --> 00:10:19.995
want to help you discover it
through relationship with Jesus.

00:10:20.355 --> 00:10:24.105
I want you to help me to separate my
purpose through relationship with Jesus.

00:10:24.255 --> 00:10:25.305
You say, Hey, you're a pastor.

00:10:25.305 --> 00:10:25.965
You should know that.

00:10:25.965 --> 00:10:28.905
No, I'm still discovering that
every day that I follow Jesus.

00:10:29.505 --> 00:10:30.595
And so how do we do that as.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.810
Well, we teach people to discover their
purpose by following Jesus, by living

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:41.189
in community, by serving those around
them and by expanding God's kingdom.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.339
And so how I'm going to explain
the leadership side of things this

00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:45.630
year is through those four things.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.010
And I'm gonna explain some
more things that we're going

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:47.969
to be involved in this year.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.020
And so as a church, how are we going to,
to follow Jesus and live in community?

00:10:52.229 --> 00:10:56.939
Well, as I begin to just really
seek the word of God to develop

00:10:56.939 --> 00:10:58.140
leaders means to develop.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.400
And so most of you probably know
this is that you can't have a leader.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.620
If you didn't go to the business
board, you can't have a leader until

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.810
you develop that leader, right.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.449
Until you actually develop them
to even know the culture, to

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:11.010
know who God is really for us.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:11.400
Right.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.050
And so Matthew four 19 came to mind and
maybe some of, you know, this verse that

00:11:16.229 --> 00:11:18.359
Matthew four 19 says, come follow me.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.530
And this is Jesus speaking.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.410
And Jesus said to them,
I will make you fishers.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.310
So, how does that apply to us as a
church in leadership development?

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:34.110
Well, we know that it requires following
Jesus before we ever follow and become

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.120
a leader to lead other people to Jesus.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.830
And so, uh, the one things that I
know with this, when we say, um,

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.220
Jesus saying, come follow me as I
know that you, as a church should

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.260
never come follow me as a person.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:47.819
Um, cause I'm gonna fail you.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.850
You shouldn't go follow somebody else
because they're going to fail you as well.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.110
And so as a church, if we all follow.

00:11:53.335 --> 00:11:54.655
He won't fail us.

00:11:55.105 --> 00:11:56.245
And that's my challenge to you.

00:11:56.245 --> 00:11:59.365
And I think my challenge to myself as
well, to make sure that my eyes are

00:11:59.365 --> 00:12:01.585
fixed on Jesus as we move forward.

00:12:01.825 --> 00:12:02.995
But Jesus is very clear.

00:12:02.995 --> 00:12:06.145
He says, if, if you go follow him,
he will make you fishers of men.

00:12:06.145 --> 00:12:11.815
So how does becoming fishers of men
develop leaders or make followers of

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:14.065
Christ or even fulfill our mission?

00:12:14.545 --> 00:12:17.995
Well, the ultimate purpose of every
follower of Jesus is to go make disciples.

00:12:18.475 --> 00:12:20.815
And so that means each of
us has the same purpose.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.625
But that doesn't mean we'll
accomplish it the same way.

00:12:23.655 --> 00:12:25.485
We're all gifted in different ways.

00:12:25.935 --> 00:12:27.225
So how do I bring this together here?

00:12:27.225 --> 00:12:30.015
So developing leaders starts
with developing disciples.

00:12:31.065 --> 00:12:34.695
Developing disciples starts with
teaching people to follow Jesus.

00:12:35.805 --> 00:12:38.715
And so everybody fits
somewhere on this list.

00:12:38.715 --> 00:12:43.635
Either you are a leader that's developing
disciples, or you're a disciple that is

00:12:43.635 --> 00:12:46.905
teaching people about Jesus or you're
the one that's learning about Jesus.

00:12:46.905 --> 00:12:47.835
Maybe you're somewhere in there.

00:12:47.835 --> 00:12:48.465
You're learning about.

00:12:49.365 --> 00:12:51.975
And so how's that going to work this
year as a church, as we move forward

00:12:51.975 --> 00:12:54.855
as a church, and this is a defining
year, how's it going to look forward?

00:12:54.855 --> 00:12:57.675
Well, for me as a pastor, one of the
things I'm trying to transition out of,

00:12:57.945 --> 00:13:01.125
which is so funny, because I started
thinking about this this morning, you

00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:04.785
know, as a pastor, I'm part of the setup
crew, I'm part of the parking lot crew

00:13:05.115 --> 00:13:08.955
I'm part of the, today was security
in the back until, you know, service.

00:13:09.015 --> 00:13:11.265
Uh, it kind of got started
and I could lock the door to

00:13:11.265 --> 00:13:12.165
make sure nobody comes in.

00:13:12.165 --> 00:13:15.285
And then, and then sometimes I do the
welcome and then sometimes I'm doing so,

00:13:15.285 --> 00:13:16.575
like, I'm a part of, a lot of things.

00:13:17.355 --> 00:13:21.525
Well, I want to be able to do a little bit
more focusing on leadership development.

00:13:21.855 --> 00:13:25.455
So as God has brought me to this
point, I want to this year in 2020

00:13:25.455 --> 00:13:29.205
to focus on developing leaders, which
means this I'm going to spend a little

00:13:29.205 --> 00:13:30.885
less time, probably doing tasks.

00:13:30.885 --> 00:13:35.295
And this is why we hired Elisa in
for, um, uh, 10 hours a week to help

00:13:35.295 --> 00:13:37.005
me be able to focus more on that.

00:13:37.435 --> 00:13:40.365
And I'm going to spend a little bit of
time in every one of those areas, right?

00:13:40.395 --> 00:13:42.495
Developing disciples and
teach others about Jesus.

00:13:42.495 --> 00:13:44.865
You're not going to miss that part of
it, but I'm going to focus on developing.

00:13:45.895 --> 00:13:47.995
But our core team and those of
you who would say, Hey, who's

00:13:47.995 --> 00:13:50.905
on the core team, will those who
helped us launch inspiring hope?

00:13:50.935 --> 00:13:52.285
What are they going to be doing this year?

00:13:52.285 --> 00:13:56.065
Well, they're going to be focused on
focusing on making disciples, right?

00:13:56.125 --> 00:13:58.675
And in some form or fashion, they've
been doing that, but they're going to

00:13:58.675 --> 00:14:00.205
focus more of their effort on that.

00:14:00.205 --> 00:14:03.445
Well, how's that going to look, anybody
that's newer to inspire and hope

00:14:03.655 --> 00:14:05.425
is going to be invested in by them.

00:14:05.425 --> 00:14:08.725
And so, as they build relationships
with you, their goal is to invest

00:14:08.725 --> 00:14:11.575
in you and help you discover your
purpose through a relationship with G.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.550
And so who's, who's the other part, right?

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.280
The other part is anybody
that's maybe a, a new member or

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.180
maybe you're just an attender.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.060
Maybe this first time you're coming.

00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:21.569
You're saying what's my part
in 2022, it's for you to be

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.400
involved in what God's doing here.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.420
It's for you to learn from those who
are pouring into you, being a part of

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.439
what God's doing, and ultimately become
someone that develops disciples, right?

00:14:31.439 --> 00:14:34.470
So you're going to be poured
into, to become a disciple maker.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.589
And the disciple makers will be the ones
that are poured into, to become leaders.

00:14:38.625 --> 00:14:39.765
That are serving alongside me.

00:14:39.885 --> 00:14:42.105
And that's kind of a short version
of what that's going to look like

00:14:42.105 --> 00:14:45.795
this year and focusing our efforts
more on developing relationships.

00:14:46.245 --> 00:14:48.855
So again, as a church, we want
to teach you to follow Jesus.

00:14:49.454 --> 00:14:52.665
And those are things that we're going
to do in 2022 to make sure we do that.

00:14:52.665 --> 00:14:55.694
Number two, we talk about
living in community guys.

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:58.995
Community is so important to in
life together is so important.

00:14:58.995 --> 00:15:02.204
And as a church, we will
continue to prioritize that over.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.810
Most things.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.280
And so you see us as a church.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.630
We're, we're, we're smaller, right?

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.689
We're newer, but we want to have a
relaxed atmosphere that says this

00:15:09.689 --> 00:15:11.100
isn't a, this isn't a program.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.010
This is, this is not something we're
trying to put on an experience.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.189
We're literally wanting
to do life together.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.220
And so you'll see our worship
is a worship that's inviting.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.810
This has let's worship together.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.189
Let's not worship to you.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.680
Let's live life together.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.360
And one of the coolest things
I just had this conversation

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.780
with Jackie was something tragic
has happened with her son.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.650
Luckily he's, he's fine.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:37.290
But she said, this church showed
up when I needed them and her

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.460
life has changed because of it.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.610
And thank you so much for sharing that,
because what that told me is we're

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:47.580
doing what God's called us to do, to be
the body of Christ, to work together,

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.930
to love and support one another.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.670
So we're going to continue
to live in community.

00:15:52.334 --> 00:15:55.035
So as we do this, right, we're
going to be putting this emphasis

00:15:55.035 --> 00:15:58.574
on developing leaders and teaching
people to follow Jesus, right.

00:15:58.574 --> 00:16:02.625
In order to see each person discover
their purpose and to teach them to help

00:16:02.655 --> 00:16:04.334
other people discover their purpose.

00:16:05.355 --> 00:16:06.135
We're going to focus on this.

00:16:06.135 --> 00:16:08.115
So is that the only thing we're
going to focus on as a church?

00:16:08.415 --> 00:16:10.185
No, but I'll tell you this.

00:16:10.574 --> 00:16:13.905
If we don't focus on that first,
we'll miss the rest of it.

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:17.355
So we're going to continue to focus
on developing leaders, developing

00:16:17.355 --> 00:16:18.704
disciples, teaching people about.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.060
And growing people up to know him, because
if, and I think Jenna said this great

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.390
whenever she was sharing earlier, if
we don't teach people to follow Jesus,

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.720
we can teach them to be good people,
but we're missing the greatest part

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.750
because our relationship with Jesus
is the number one priority in each one

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:37.920
of our lives to know him and for him
to know us, the God of the universe

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.050
wants to know you personally, he does.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.850
Doesn't want to be this
figurehead that's in your life.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.370
He wants to know you and
he wants you to know him.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.319
And I think so much about this.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.950
My wife doesn't want me
to just exist with her.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:54.210
She wants me to know her and for me to
know her and to be able to get to know

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.570
one another and do life together and
God desires that same thing for you.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:02.490
But so whenever we think about this,
right, I think of Matthew 28, 18

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.670
through 20 affirms, everything we're
talking about is where God says

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:06.900
go therefore and make disciples.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.210
And so we're going to do that,
but that's not the only thing

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.050
that we're going to focus on.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:10.350
Right?

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:15.090
We also want to focus on serving
those around us and expanding gutsy.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.890
So our call is a church to serve
the community and expand God's

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.060
kingdom is going to ramp up.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.150
So one of the things you've seen, maybe
if you've been here and if you haven't,

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.990
you'll get to hear a bit about it.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:27.210
Today is we focused on
serving our community.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:30.030
Once a month, we take a Sunday,
we don't have a service.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.550
And we say, we're serving our
community in some form or fashion.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.420
We are changing that a little bit by being
a little bit more organized and planned.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.250
We're going try to be more
focused on our efforts.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.010
And one of those is you guys actually
heard about what we're doing in our.

00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:44.034
Four weeks in advance rather
than a couple of weeks advance.

00:17:44.034 --> 00:17:44.335
Right?

00:17:44.575 --> 00:17:46.014
So we're going to be a
little bit better at that.

00:17:46.045 --> 00:17:48.085
We're going to be including
more of you in this.

00:17:48.085 --> 00:17:49.284
And this is one of the coolest parts.

00:17:49.524 --> 00:17:54.024
We had a local missions team meeting
several months ago, and I think there

00:17:54.024 --> 00:17:57.475
was six or eight people in there,
which means it's not just being

00:17:57.475 --> 00:18:00.895
led by one person, but it's all of
us taking ownership and planning,

00:18:00.895 --> 00:18:02.845
organizing, and doing these things.

00:18:02.845 --> 00:18:06.355
And so we're going to do
that, um, a little bit more.

00:18:06.655 --> 00:18:09.284
One of the things that I want to share
with you guys that is new this year, that.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.950
It is going to be one of our
biggest focuses is our location.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.030
Um, so this location where you're
at again, if you weren't here, when

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.639
we first started this location,
this was just a storage room.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.210
And so we were able to come in partner
with pathway to say, Hey, how can we

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.649
get this space prepared for your future
ministry, um, to expand and for us to

00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:30.240
meet here for a time and they loved it.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.430
And so we got done doing the
floors and the walls, and we

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.260
put up a few of the things and.

00:18:35.355 --> 00:18:39.795
We told them this, whenever we
need to leave, we will leave so

00:18:39.795 --> 00:18:41.025
that your ministry can expand.

00:18:41.025 --> 00:18:44.565
And so I had a conversation recently
with the director here and she said, Hey,

00:18:44.565 --> 00:18:46.185
we're getting ready to expand this year.

00:18:46.515 --> 00:18:51.195
And so what that told me is our time is
coming to a close here at pathway, but

00:18:51.225 --> 00:18:56.025
the opportunity to go serve our community
some other way is coming together.

00:18:56.415 --> 00:18:59.175
And so this year we believe
that our future location,

00:18:59.175 --> 00:19:01.095
wherever it is, is going to.

00:19:02.055 --> 00:19:04.034
The community and serve the church.

00:19:04.034 --> 00:19:06.885
And so does anybody here want to
know where the next location is?

00:19:09.429 --> 00:19:09.850
I do too.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:13.899
When you find out, let me know, um,
because that's what we're doing right now.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.719
Uh, we've got some time I say
this, uh, probably by the summer

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.530
to early fall, we're shooting
to find a space to move into.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:24.760
Um, and so as the Lord has led me in
and the conversations that I've had in

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.689
the community, I really believe that
the Lord is opening a door for us to do

00:19:28.689 --> 00:19:30.520
something with the multi-use facility.

00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:34.905
Um, and what that means is that we're
talking about, and again, We are a

00:19:34.905 --> 00:19:36.014
church that wants to do two things.

00:19:36.014 --> 00:19:37.245
We want to be cost-effective.

00:19:37.995 --> 00:19:40.065
Um, and we want to be simple.

00:19:40.335 --> 00:19:43.185
Well cost-effective is not
purchasing a facility or renting a

00:19:43.185 --> 00:19:46.155
facility and using it once a week
it's to use it during the week.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.805
And so we want to be able to do that.

00:19:47.805 --> 00:19:50.865
And so we think that there could be an
opportunity for us to open up something,

00:19:51.285 --> 00:19:52.785
um, on the west side of Hamilton.

00:19:53.264 --> 00:19:57.314
Um, where we can have an afterschool rec
center or something like that, where kids

00:19:57.314 --> 00:20:00.915
could come over, hopefully in walking
distance of Wilson, middle school,

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:04.905
possibly the high school to be able to
get help on homework, to be able to just

00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:08.625
have a safe place, to hang out, to get
great mentorship for us to love on them.

00:20:08.895 --> 00:20:10.695
Um, and again, just
bring a great atmosphere.

00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:12.345
I don't know where that's going to be.

00:20:12.345 --> 00:20:13.875
I have no clue haven't found it yet.

00:20:14.264 --> 00:20:16.485
Um, and again, if you have
any ideas, you let me know.

00:20:16.485 --> 00:20:18.175
That's something that
we're interested in, in.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.960
Talking about, because we believe
that God's called us here to

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.020
reach a community and minister
to a community, not displaying a

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.120
church, not displaying a church.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:31.980
And so again, this location, um,
we'll, we'll, we'll hopefully do that.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.050
And so one of the things that,
again, we could be looking for is

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.880
just a temporary space right now.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.030
So as, again, as you're, you're praying
and seeking the Lord, it could just be a

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.650
temporary space until we figure that out.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.210
Um, I don't really know.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.740
Um, but it also could be a permanent.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.590
Um, as well, but here's what we do know.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.870
And I want, I want to make sure
in communicate this, we want this

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:52.050
location to be a strategic location
that serves the community first

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:56.070
and then a space for us to meet on
Sundays, serves our community first,

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.110
and then as a space for us on Sundays.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.580
I love Sunday worship.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:00.900
I absolutely do.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:03.690
But if our space caters more to
our Sunday worship than it does

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.570
to our community, we've missed
out on who we are as a church.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.580
I don't want to change
the identity as a church.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.320
Our identity is to be served.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:16.500
And we'll meet somewhere somehow
some way, because that will

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.760
happen because we love each other.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.090
Right.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:19.230
I mean, I love you guys.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.770
I don't want you.

00:21:19.889 --> 00:21:20.190
Okay.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.139
But I didn't get here much back.

00:21:22.139 --> 00:21:23.370
So I'm really starting to wonder.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:28.980
Um, but what I would say is that that's
going to be a big focus for us this year

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.980
and the fact of not distracting us from
our mission, but to be a part of our.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.830
Not to distract us permission
to be a part of our mission.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.460
Right?

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.560
So our, we talked a
little bit about our surf.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.390
Sundays are gonna be a little bit
different, but one of the things I want

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:43.200
to mention to you are serving ranching,
ramping up the, in the community this

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.970
year is this past year we had around
six to seven mission teams and mission

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.330
teams, our teams, um, and other churches
that have partnered with us outside

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:55.440
the state of, uh, of Ohio, um, to
come in and help serve our community.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:00.930
This year, we have plans, I guess they
planned, um, estimated around 12 missions.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.270
From about five different states that
will come in and partner with us.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.450
That's estimated of over 200
people that will come in and spend

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.660
about a week here throughout this
year to come serve our community.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.700
Well what's how are we going to do that?

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.280
I mean, trust me, I'm starting
to work with Lisa right now.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.180
How are we going to do that?

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:21.650
But I know this it's an opportunity to
come in and say that we love Hamilton.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.160
We love the organizations
that are making a difference.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:28.010
And one of the things you guys have
heard me say over and over again,

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.980
we will, we will invest in school.

00:22:32.205 --> 00:22:35.085
As we have in the past and some of the
cool things we've got to do, and I'm

00:22:35.085 --> 00:22:37.365
so glad that, uh, Josh is here today.

00:22:37.544 --> 00:22:39.615
Um, we've got to invest in
Riverview, which is right up the

00:22:39.615 --> 00:22:42.435
road elementary by investing in
their staff, going and helping with

00:22:42.435 --> 00:22:45.794
mentorship, purchasing clothes for
the kids and this mentorship program.

00:22:46.125 --> 00:22:47.955
Um, bringing school supplies.

00:22:48.165 --> 00:22:49.784
Um, we've also went to
Wilson middle school.

00:22:49.784 --> 00:22:50.985
I just went there on Friday.

00:22:50.985 --> 00:22:53.294
One of the coolest things miss  at Wilson.

00:22:53.534 --> 00:22:54.615
Um, I showed up on Friday.

00:22:54.615 --> 00:22:56.325
She gave me a shirt, put
me in the sat picture.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.399
I loved it because I love their staff.

00:22:59.429 --> 00:23:00.419
Their staff is amazing.

00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:01.169
We brought gifts for them.

00:23:01.169 --> 00:23:03.510
I actually brought snacks for
their staff or their staff lounge

00:23:03.719 --> 00:23:05.159
with encouraging messages on them.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:10.830
Um, I know that it's difficult to,
to, to, to basically, uh, for the

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:11.909
teachers and staff to deal with.

00:23:12.855 --> 00:23:16.905
We want them to know that we support
them 100% and we also want to minister

00:23:16.905 --> 00:23:18.855
to the kids and the families as well.

00:23:19.155 --> 00:23:22.875
So we're going to, to ramp that up as much
as we possibly can through our mission

00:23:22.875 --> 00:23:24.495
teams and partnering with them as well.

00:23:24.855 --> 00:23:26.235
Um, and same thing with
our local missions.

00:23:26.235 --> 00:23:27.135
And I want to share this.

00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:29.175
I thought this was cool.

00:23:29.175 --> 00:23:34.905
So from 2021, we spent, um,
I wanted to look my number

00:23:34.915 --> 00:23:36.855
specifically, or we spent 32.

00:23:37.905 --> 00:23:39.915
$32,000 on missions.

00:23:39.915 --> 00:23:42.825
This year, 25,000 of that was local 7,000.

00:23:42.825 --> 00:23:46.725
That was helping international church
plants as well as our, our organization

00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:47.805
that we were planting through.

00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:51.135
But if you include pathway and the
money that we invested here, that we're

00:23:51.135 --> 00:23:55.965
leaving every bit of this space for their
future space, we spent close to $45,000.

00:23:56.355 --> 00:23:57.735
I want you guys to just look around here.

00:23:58.575 --> 00:24:00.375
We're at, I mean, we're
growing as a church, right.

00:24:00.375 --> 00:24:06.435
But $45,000 in missions and
over probably 35 of that was.

00:24:08.865 --> 00:24:09.435
Praise God.

00:24:09.524 --> 00:24:10.485
Yeah, there we go.

00:24:10.754 --> 00:24:11.355
Come on.

00:24:13.064 --> 00:24:14.504
I want to increase that.

00:24:14.745 --> 00:24:17.774
I want to continue to invest
more and more and more why?

00:24:17.774 --> 00:24:22.695
Because we want to make this community
better now because they need our help.

00:24:22.725 --> 00:24:26.385
It's because we desire to be here where
we're not here as like fixers we're

00:24:26.385 --> 00:24:30.195
here as just what I would say to join
the mission of what Hamilton's already.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:35.010
Right to invest in families and to
invest in schools and to invest in

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.170
the community to make it greater.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.710
And I'll tell you this it's because of
Jesus that we get to do that it's because

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:44.460
we want to be the light of Christ to the
world that says that Jesus loves them.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.850
And that Jesus says that he came
first to serve, not to be served.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.970
And as a church, I want the
last thing to be told of us.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.250
Taking something from the community.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.190
I want it to be known to us,
uh, giving to the community.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.620
And so we will continue to prioritize
that as a church this year, more and more.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.710
So I wanted, I wanted to
just remind you guys of this.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:09.280
Whenever we came to plant and make the
decision of whether God was calling us to

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.120
plant in Hamilton, the number one reason
why I believe that God had burdened.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.880
My heart is one of the statistics
that I think may be higher now

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.390
was 51% of the homes that had
parents or somebody that had kids

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.460
in homes were single parent homes.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.520
I think that statistics probably
higher now from what I'm hearing,

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.390
but if that's true, there's more
families that need our help.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.010
Then we had the ability to.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.800
So what's that mean?

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.840
So this, this goes into
the next part, right?

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.380
We want to be a church that not only
serves, but that expands God's kingdom.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.660
And so we want to expand God's
kingdom by multiplying disciples,

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.300
which are already talked about we're
focused this year on that, right?

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.870
By multiplying our inspire groups, which
means doing community more with people.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.140
And so we'll do that by training up
more leaders and starting more groups.

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.420
But the last one is
starting more churches.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.580
How are we going to start another church?

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.750
I mean, we're just getting started here.

00:25:55.455 --> 00:25:56.715
Well, we've always said this.

00:25:56.715 --> 00:25:58.725
We didn't come to Hamilton
to plant one church.

00:25:58.935 --> 00:26:01.065
We came to Hamilton to plant
multiple churches that we

00:26:01.065 --> 00:26:02.085
believe this community needs.

00:26:02.085 --> 00:26:04.754
And one of the things that God may
be opening the door for us to do

00:26:05.024 --> 00:26:07.665
and against for some of you, this
may not be surprising, but we have

00:26:07.935 --> 00:26:11.085
possibly a connection to plant
Hispanic church here in Hamilton.

00:26:11.565 --> 00:26:14.355
Um, again, by God's grace
God's story, a plane.

00:26:15.315 --> 00:26:18.254
Um, to rain, basically, I was going
to speak somewhere on a plane ride

00:26:18.254 --> 00:26:21.495
to a connection, to a phone call
to a family that feels like God's

00:26:21.495 --> 00:26:22.605
calling me to plant a church.

00:26:22.905 --> 00:26:25.875
Um, and I'll tell you this, the more time
that I've spent in the schools, I think.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.830
Less to the parents than probably
any of the Hispanic connections that

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:33.180
I know of because I just, I just
don't have the ability to do that.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:37.080
And so we're talking to this
couple, it is, is a PR process.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.100
So we're still new to this.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.890
That again, I'm just telling you
this to say, Hey, we have a chance

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.010
to possibly plan a Spanish church
in the future here in Hamilton.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.410
I think there's a need, well,
what's the Hispanic church gonna do.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:46.800
It's going to.

00:26:47.445 --> 00:26:49.725
R I want to say, rDNA, don't have
to have our name, but I'm saying

00:26:49.725 --> 00:26:53.865
our DNA of serving the community and
meeting the needs in the community.

00:26:53.865 --> 00:26:58.035
And so I'm super excited about that
opportunity for us to possibly do that.

00:26:58.335 --> 00:26:59.775
Um, and so that's crazy.

00:26:59.775 --> 00:27:00.765
How could we plant another church?

00:27:00.795 --> 00:27:01.875
I'm just telling you this.

00:27:03.105 --> 00:27:04.395
We will not.

00:27:06.085 --> 00:27:07.465
Um, I'm going to try to
say this in the right way.

00:27:07.465 --> 00:27:10.165
We will not dishonor
God by small thinking.

00:27:12.475 --> 00:27:16.225
We believe God can, and
he will do more than one.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.420
Ever think or ask, and I'll tell you
this, it, this it's not about us.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.250
I don't care if our name gets put in.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.090
It's not about our name.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.830
It's about Jesus.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.740
I want to see people's lives changed.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.330
I seen a period every week.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:31.770
Let me just be real with you.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.970
I say for every week, not knowing
how the heck God can use me to share.

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.550
I'm not that gifted in
the fact of who I am.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.400
I'm passionate for Jesus.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.780
I'm passionate for you.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.780
And the more that you get to know
me, and if you don't know this.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.000
I care for you.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.720
I don't care for your attendance,
even though I'd love to see you.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.350
I don't care for your money, even though
I'd love for you to give I care for you.

00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:59.909
And I believe that there's more people
in this church that believe that same

00:27:59.909 --> 00:28:01.889
thing, that they care for you as well.

00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:03.450
And that's why we do life together.

00:28:03.629 --> 00:28:06.480
And we want other people in this community
and other people in your neighborhoods,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.169
wherever you live to know that same
thing that you care for them, that

00:28:10.169 --> 00:28:11.669
you love them, that you support them.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.679
And that Jesus loves them.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.790
And that's what drives.

00:28:15.945 --> 00:28:18.975
And as a church, we will
continue starting this year.

00:28:18.975 --> 00:28:20.835
We're going to continue
it even more, right.

00:28:21.105 --> 00:28:25.545
To be a church that exists to
inspire hope by helping people

00:28:25.545 --> 00:28:28.635
discover God's purpose for the life
through relationship with Jesus.

00:28:29.025 --> 00:28:32.025
We will do that by following
Jesus, ourselves, and teaching

00:28:32.025 --> 00:28:32.865
other people to follow Jesus.

00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:36.795
We will do that by living in community
and inviting people into that community.

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:41.865
We will do that by serving first in
our community and those around us,

00:28:42.165 --> 00:28:43.575
we will do it by expanding God's.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:49.050
For his glory, our good, and for the
ability to celebrate more and more

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.780
every single day that we live that way.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.950
And so the question is then
is this vision too big?

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.730
I asked myself this question.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.100
So I, I do this a lot in my messages.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.460
I finished a message and I go,
all right, Ben, what's this mean?

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.090
Like, what is this?

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:03.310
Is this.

00:29:05.055 --> 00:29:08.235
Is developing leaders who make disciples
too big as find a new location and

00:29:08.235 --> 00:29:11.685
invest in our community too big is
investing more money and time and people

00:29:11.685 --> 00:29:14.595
and serving our community too big is
starting another church at this point.

00:29:14.595 --> 00:29:17.565
And in our ministry too
big for us, absolutely.

00:29:17.745 --> 00:29:20.445
100%, 100% for us.

00:29:20.445 --> 00:29:23.774
It is not for God, not for God.

00:29:24.675 --> 00:29:29.115
And in every day that I see Kim
and we seek him together because

00:29:29.115 --> 00:29:30.435
this is our church, right?

00:29:30.735 --> 00:29:31.305
It's not mine.

00:29:31.455 --> 00:29:32.145
It's our church.

00:29:32.175 --> 00:29:32.935
As we seek.

00:29:35.425 --> 00:29:36.475
And we depend upon him.

00:29:37.345 --> 00:29:39.445
Oh gosh, no, this, this may be too small.

00:29:40.495 --> 00:29:41.334
And guess what?

00:29:41.334 --> 00:29:46.465
If he comes back to us and challenges
us to up it, we will, because I want

00:29:46.465 --> 00:29:47.485
to be a part of what God's doing.

00:29:47.574 --> 00:29:48.205
I don't know about you.

00:29:48.865 --> 00:29:51.745
I want to be a part of it and we
have a choice to be a part of it.

00:29:53.274 --> 00:29:55.705
So God desires and I, I
challenged myself in this.

00:29:55.705 --> 00:29:59.725
God is ours to reach this city,
your neighbors, my neighbors,

00:29:59.814 --> 00:30:01.264
our community, more than.

00:30:03.115 --> 00:30:05.245
So sometimes whenever I get a
little frustrated about maybe

00:30:05.245 --> 00:30:06.115
why isn't God doing this?

00:30:06.115 --> 00:30:07.255
Why isn't God doing that?

00:30:08.185 --> 00:30:12.835
God reminds me, oh, I really care more
than you do and what this church does

00:30:12.835 --> 00:30:14.095
and how we invest in this community.

00:30:14.575 --> 00:30:18.835
So I'm gonna challenge you that this
statement, again, I believe this year

00:30:18.835 --> 00:30:22.525
is the defining year for us as a church,
because it has changed from a church

00:30:22.555 --> 00:30:29.305
that was started by a family to now
it is led by families who love Jesus,

00:30:30.025 --> 00:30:31.075
who decided to see their community.

00:30:32.085 --> 00:30:35.115
And supported and served and
wants to see his kingdom expanded.

00:30:36.105 --> 00:30:37.455
So how do we conclude today?

00:30:37.995 --> 00:30:39.165
This is my challenge for you.

00:30:39.165 --> 00:30:43.335
We do something called an invitation
and an invitation is an opportunity

00:30:43.335 --> 00:30:45.495
to reflect on what was shared today.

00:30:45.495 --> 00:30:47.835
And again, today was not a typical
message where I'm walking through

00:30:47.835 --> 00:30:51.315
a text, but I'm telling you
this, I believe God is all over.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.050
I believe God is in every
aspect and every part of it.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.659
And so Darren invitation,
it's an opportunity to say I'm

00:30:58.659 --> 00:30:59.830
going to reflect in this time.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.360
So as, as Brock leads, as, as, as he
leads, worship this, this for this

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.870
time, I want you to reflect and ask
God this question, God, what's my part.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.000
What is my part?

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.330
Because I'll tell you this
and, and challenging you.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.010
This may be your first time here.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.110
And you're saying, I just showed up.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.760
I mean, somebody invited me.

00:31:20.335 --> 00:31:24.085
Uh, I'm not going to be a part of this
cause I'm, uh, I'm trust me, like you

00:31:24.085 --> 00:31:28.764
have a part in this, please like seek
the Lord and say, Hey, what is it?

00:31:29.485 --> 00:31:32.004
Maybe you came in just like,
man, I'm having a rough week.

00:31:32.034 --> 00:31:34.645
And I don't even, I'm telling you,
God wants you to be a part of it.

00:31:37.345 --> 00:31:41.365
So during this time of invitation, I want
you to ask the Lord this question, what

00:31:41.365 --> 00:31:42.564
is it, Lord that I need to be a part of.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:47.160
You know, and I want to give you some,
some opera opportunities, some, some

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.410
things that you may say, well, I don't
know what the, the next part of it is.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:50.580
So, so here's the number one.

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:55.230
If you want to be a part of what God's
doing here at inspiring hope, I'll tell

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:58.770
you you'll be hard pressed to do it
without the number one most important

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.000
thing that we've talked about all day.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.660
If you haven't followed Jesus yet,
if you haven't given your life

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:07.680
to Jesus, if you're still kind of
wondering about that, that's your next.

00:32:08.685 --> 00:32:11.445
And that's not me being like
legalistic or like narrow minded.

00:32:11.445 --> 00:32:13.515
That's me saying, Hey, like
that's who we're about.

00:32:14.145 --> 00:32:17.415
So to be a part of what we're doing,
like that's going to be a key aspect

00:32:18.075 --> 00:32:21.195
and what we're doing, and if you're
not there yet, here's my thing.

00:32:21.225 --> 00:32:24.315
I'm not going to be this person that
twist your arm to give your life to Jesus.

00:32:24.525 --> 00:32:28.185
If you're not there yet, please keep
coming in pursuing that relationship.

00:32:28.185 --> 00:32:29.415
Cause maybe that's your next step.

00:32:29.715 --> 00:32:32.655
Just keep pursuing, keep
asking, keep seeking.

00:32:33.825 --> 00:32:36.255
So for some of you, it could
be to give your life to Jesus.

00:32:37.215 --> 00:32:38.565
Once you give your life to Jesus.

00:32:39.075 --> 00:32:40.485
Please come talk to me after service.

00:32:40.515 --> 00:32:41.535
I want to talk to you.

00:32:41.535 --> 00:32:43.365
I want you to know him.

00:32:43.815 --> 00:32:46.095
I don't want to be able to talk to
you about that for some of you, it

00:32:46.095 --> 00:32:47.355
could be just living in community.

00:32:47.655 --> 00:32:51.165
You're coming on Sundays, but you're
missing the greatest community possible,

00:32:51.165 --> 00:32:52.845
which is when we meet during the week.

00:32:53.175 --> 00:32:55.185
And what I always say, meet
they're meeting during the

00:32:55.185 --> 00:32:56.175
week we pull our hair down.

00:32:56.175 --> 00:32:59.145
If we have it, that means we're
probably a little bit more laid

00:32:59.145 --> 00:33:01.815
back and we take whatever message
was was preached on Sunday.

00:33:01.815 --> 00:33:04.065
We take that message and we say,
Hey, how do we live this out?

00:33:05.129 --> 00:33:09.570
How do we live this out last week, it
was setting godly new year's resolutions.

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:12.510
And I laughed because we came
into group and I said, how many

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.770
of you set new year's resolutions?

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:15.389
None of them raised their hands.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:17.850
That mean that message went out the door.

00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:19.500
So here's what I did.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.260
How do we set godly
resolutions, not new years.

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:23.399
What's a resolution.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:28.860
It's a strong firm decision to do, or
to not do something every day, every

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.129
day we can make resolutions, whether you
believe in new year's resolutions or not.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:33.330
So what do we do?

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:34.050
We pulled our hair down.

00:33:34.875 --> 00:33:38.804
We we leaned in and we said, what's
it look like to be a better version

00:33:38.804 --> 00:33:41.175
of ourselves for the glory of God.

00:33:42.885 --> 00:33:43.935
And we got to talk about that.

00:33:43.995 --> 00:33:45.045
We get to encourage one another.

00:33:45.045 --> 00:33:45.915
We get to pray together.

00:33:46.275 --> 00:33:48.345
See that's the community
that God's inviting you to.

00:33:48.345 --> 00:33:51.405
So maybe that's your next step for
some of you really, it could just

00:33:51.405 --> 00:33:55.095
be coming to a next steps launch in
learning more about inspiring hope and

00:33:55.095 --> 00:33:58.335
saying, Hey, maybe our next step is,
is to be a part of this church and we

00:33:58.335 --> 00:33:59.715
have a next steps lunch next Sunday.

00:33:59.715 --> 00:34:02.145
And you can sign up on the
next steps table as well.

00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:05.325
For some of you, it could be being more
involved in our serving our community.

00:34:05.715 --> 00:34:08.955
Um, anybody that wants to go with
me to the schools administer.

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:13.440
Come on anybody that feels like God's
leading them to do something in their

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.239
community or their neighborhood go.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:20.040
And we'll resource you support you and
send you maybe it's God just asking

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.400
you, challenging you to step up your
game and serving those around you.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.739
The last is maybe it's God challenging
you to expand God's kingdom.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:30.900
And so you may say, well, we're, we're not
even there yet, but some of you could be,

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.670
some of you could be sitting in this room.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.259
You've been a part of our
core team for a while.

00:34:34.259 --> 00:34:35.190
And you're saying God's called.

00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:36.975
To start an inspire group.

00:34:37.005 --> 00:34:38.775
God's calling me to disciple a person.

00:34:39.014 --> 00:34:42.614
God is calling me, even though we haven't
started it to be a part of the next

00:34:42.614 --> 00:34:45.014
church plan, we would celebrate that.

00:34:45.465 --> 00:34:46.635
Maybe that's what God's calling you to.

00:34:46.675 --> 00:34:47.415
I don't know.

00:34:47.415 --> 00:34:48.525
I gave you nine options.

00:34:48.645 --> 00:34:50.505
Find one, choose it, pray over it.

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:51.014
Okay.

00:34:51.315 --> 00:34:52.304
That's just a challenge.

00:34:52.965 --> 00:34:57.585
Um, because God desires to
use every single one of you.

00:34:58.695 --> 00:35:01.245
We are a resource from God
and, and, and his thing.

00:35:01.245 --> 00:35:03.255
If you have a pulse today,
maybe you need to fill it.

00:35:03.655 --> 00:35:03.855
You have.

00:35:06.075 --> 00:35:07.275
God's not done with you yet.

00:35:08.445 --> 00:35:12.345
And until the day that you meet him in
heaven, God's not done with you yet.

00:35:12.915 --> 00:35:14.565
So please, please, please.

00:35:15.195 --> 00:35:17.325
Don't miss out on the
opportunity to say yes to Jesus.

00:35:18.585 --> 00:35:19.425
I'll say this last thing.

00:35:20.775 --> 00:35:26.595
There's someone, there's someone waiting
on you on the other side of your yes.

00:35:26.925 --> 00:35:31.485
To one of those things I'm telling
you guys, when we said yes to

00:35:31.485 --> 00:35:33.065
planting in Oklahoma, we had no.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:37.470
No family, no resources, no guarantee.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.569
And you know, the only thing that
kept going through my head is

00:35:39.569 --> 00:35:42.930
there someone waiting for me on
the other side of my obedience.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.000
And I'm so glad I've seen
so many people be changed.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.170
Not because I'm good.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:54.150
I'm just so you go because God's
good to meet everything that we

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.710
needed in order to be here today.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:01.110
We love every one of you, even if
I don't know, you still love you.

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:09.300
But God loves you more so as we take
time to reflect, seek the Lord, take some

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.880
time as we have this time of invitation.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.900
And if there's a question that
you have, you need prayer.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:17.130
I'm going to be in the back.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.180
I want to talk with you.

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.790
If it's after service, once we're
done with service and you want to

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.190
talk to me, I'm going to be in the
back, which means this I'm here

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.230
to help you and your next step.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:26.310
Amen.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.860
All right, let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.210
We thank you Lord.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:30.390
For this.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.400
And Lord, I pray that it was honoring
to you because Lord, if it wasn't,

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.060
I play a pray Lord that you read
everything that wasn't honoring to

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.810
you from everybody's minds and hearts,
Lord, that's what I want to be.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:45.870
And that's what this church wants to
be as a church that honors you with

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:54.030
everything that we do the Lord, we
would not bring anything Lord before

00:36:54.030 --> 00:37:00.150
any person, the desiccant Lord speak
volumes of who you are in their life.

00:37:02.655 --> 00:37:05.925
Jesus, you know what each
person here needs to do or what

00:37:05.925 --> 00:37:07.065
step they need to take Lord?

00:37:07.065 --> 00:37:12.345
Not because they have to lower
because they get to Lord.

00:37:12.345 --> 00:37:15.465
I pray that each person is there
praying today and seeking Lord

00:37:15.465 --> 00:37:16.515
what their next step may be.

00:37:17.355 --> 00:37:20.745
Lord, that they don't feel
burdened in a negative way.

00:37:20.745 --> 00:37:25.065
Lord, that their burden is to be a
part of this bigger, bigger picture.

00:37:25.065 --> 00:37:27.795
Lord, this bigger thing that you're
doing here in our church, in our.

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:34.440
So Lord give each person the wisdom
to know what that is or give each

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.590
person just the knowledge and
understanding and the, the faith

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:42.240
Lord to trust you in that next step.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:47.580
Because Lord, when they take that
next step Lord, you will bring about

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:51.690
such a joy and a peace and a hope.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.900
And Lord you'll change not only
their lives, but the lives of the.

00:37:56.955 --> 00:37:58.455
God, I'm just praying that you move.

00:37:58.725 --> 00:38:03.435
Like you've never moved before in our
church, Lord and Lord, may it start with

00:38:03.435 --> 00:38:09.225
me, Lord, may I first consider everything
that I've challenged everyone to and may I

00:38:09.225 --> 00:38:15.795
consider Lord what my next step may be so
that I can lead the charge Lord, because

00:38:15.795 --> 00:38:17.205
Lord, I want to honor you with my life.

00:38:18.315 --> 00:38:19.965
And so Lord, we just pray
this in your headline name.

00:38:20.895 --> 00:38:21.195
Amen.

00:38:21.605 --> 00:38:21.875
Amen.
