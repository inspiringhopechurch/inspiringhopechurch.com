00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.290
It's difficult to come up and
be excited and be a part of the

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.880
kids, but I absolutely loved it.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.410
And so if you brought kids,
grandkids, thank you so much.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.970
Um, I know they enjoyed it.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.810
I enjoyed it.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.830
It gave me energy and your refreshes, BMC
kids have fun and, uh, be able to learn a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.210
little bit more about Jesus, um, and get
excited about serving their community.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.150
So one, the things I want to share
with you briefly, before we start

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.490
here is our church is dedicated.

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:31.365
To inspire and our safety.

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:33.385
One of the ways that we do
that is through service.

00:00:33.455 --> 00:00:36.285
If you guys want to know kind of how
we do that, we'd love to be able to

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:37.545
our strategy, to fulfill our mission.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:38.655
You guys heard our mission earlier, right.

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:41.775
Is to inspire hope by helping people
discover God's purpose for the live

00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:43.545
through relationship with Jesus.

00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:44.585
And how do we fulfill that?

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:49.635
It's by following Jesus, live in a
community, serving those rounders

00:00:49.635 --> 00:00:50.685
and expanding God's kingdom.

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:53.835
And so what are the highlights of
our churches to serve our community?

00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:56.535
We do that by financial
giving, but we also do that by

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:57.705
serving, having vacation Bible.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.780
Once a month, we actually
don't have a service and we go

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.740
out and serve our community.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.760
We're really dedicated to serving our
community because we love our community.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.520
So that's why I associate that with TBC.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.030
You guys knew who we were our heart,
but one of the things I was preparing a

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.130
message this week for today was this is,
Hey, w what, what are you gonna preach on?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.220
Um, and one of the things that I
learned alongside your kids is that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.080
we are God's workmanship created
for good works that God prepared

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.460
ahead of time as efficience to.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.950
And so decided the, Hey, why not
take, um, the patient's texts,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.890
Ephesians one, or it's patient
chapter two verses one through 10

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.300
and walk to that and reach that.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.280
So that's what we're going to be doing.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.400
You have your Bibles, right?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.350
If you don't, you can look
up here on the screen.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.320
I believe there's going to be
a text behind me, my courage.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.259
And I encourage this, every school
that I get the opportunity to, if

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.610
you don't have a Bible, let me know.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.050
I'm gonna give you one number two.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.470
You don't want to carry a Bible around,
which rarely do I know my past, but

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.560
rarely do I carry my Bible around
because it's like, I forget about.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.210
So I get it on my phone.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.730
So go to your phone, go to the
app store, download the holy

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.410
Bible app or the universal Bible.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.160
The same thing.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.400
It's a great app to be able to bring the
word of God with you, wherever you go.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.750
So you can pull that up.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.500
But I want to start with this.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.810
I like asking questions to get
you guys a little bit engaged.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.920
So I want to ask this question.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.130
Do you guys believe that God
has planned for your life?

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.320
And if you do, if you believe God
has a plan for your life and what

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.210
you're reaching and you believe
that God has planned for your life.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.110
Okay.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.990
So the majority of us believe
that God has a plan for life.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.580
Now here's the challenge.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.940
If you believe that God has a plan for
your life, do you know the next step that

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.200
you need to take to follow that plan?

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.680
Raise your hand.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.020
Do you know the next step you
need to take to follow that plane?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.300
See, I expected a lot less hands.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.200
I really did.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.760
And some of you raised your
getting up so glad of that.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.320
And here's the reason why I think, and
I believe most of you were lightening.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.070
That's probably a good thing because
we're all in the same crowd, right?

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.720
I think sometimes we try
to separate yourselves.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.610
We're broken people that are
constantly searching why we were here.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.240
What we're designed to do
what God's called us to do.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.940
And so, because of we're searching
and we're searching and searching.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.530
So start thinking about this thing.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.870
We will never get where
God's calling us to go.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.850
We don't know where we are.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.080
I'll say that again.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.540
We'll never get where
God's calling us to go.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.390
If we don't know where
we are, y'all know this.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.590
You ever gotten anywhere with
your phone and you're lost and

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.980
Internet's not working, which means
you can't use no clue what you're

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.090
doing, because you have no clue.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.290
You don't know how to get
to where you're going on.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.000
Because you don't know where you are.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.840
Give me a better one.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.050
For those, those of you who probably
know the malls before they had

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.990
probably, you know, apps to show you
where the things were, but you go in

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.480
the mall and there's that map there.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.490
And it says you are here.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.480
The moment you find out where you
are, if you want to go get sneakers

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.080
and Reebok, you know, the point at
which you can go get shoes and Reebok.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.730
Right.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.210
That's what we understand.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.230
That that makes sense.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.510
So I'll go back to the statement.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.960
Many of us know the guy has.

00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:57.555
Any of us are pursuing things to try to
discover why we're creating what we're

00:03:57.555 --> 00:04:01.965
supposed to do, but we don't know how to
get there because he knows where we are.

00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:06.165
So today let's walk through this
text in Ephesians, it's going to talk

00:04:06.165 --> 00:04:11.355
about our conditions before we come to
Christ our condition and how we come to

00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:13.655
Christ and what God has called us to.

00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:15.975
So once we recognize where
we are today, every one of us

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:17.315
I'll guarantee even myself as.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.930
I can identify with one of the examples
here today, about where I'm in the

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.370
money and we can all be challenged
to get next step in that goal.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.350
But every one of us would walk
out here with the next step.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.160
I love coming to messages where I
thought, Hey, this meant something.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.140
So that's my goal today is to be
able to do that through God's word.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.490
So what's your, just a couple of things.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.040
I believe that as the writer of this book
is Ephesians of efficiencies is Paul,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.210
the apostle he's writing to the church in
emphasis, and here's some statements that

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.920
he really is going to share with them.

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.840
He's going to remind us where we have come
from and what God has called us to all of

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.859
a sudden living somewhere in the middle.

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.159
And so we're going to find this, that
what we were created for and learn what

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:59.280
we were, what we were created for and
what we were for to be what our life's

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.109
work for price, how we were able to come
to Christ and then our purpose in Christ.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.909
And so really what do
we need to look at this?

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.479
This is a picture of our testimony
and a testimony is just how

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.430
God has worked in our lives.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.820
So let's jump into tech so I can kind of
get you guys included in this, but we're

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.260
going to go through, so Ephesians chapter.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.570
Starting in verse one, it says this in
and you were dead in your trespasses

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.940
and sins in which you previously lived.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.060
According to the ways of this
world, according to the ruler of

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.770
the power of the air in the spirit.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.049
Now working in the disobedient, we to
all previously lived among them in our

00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:38.549
fleshly dissenters, carrying out the
inclinations of our flesh and thoughts.

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:44.299
And we were by nature children
under wrath as others, or also, but.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.020
Who is rich in mercy because of
his great love that he had for

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.790
us made us alive with Christ.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.470
Even though we were dead in our
trespasses, you are saved by grace.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.210
He also raised him up and raised us
up with him and seated us with him in

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.550
heaven and the heavens in Christ Jesus.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.410
So that in the coming ages, he might
display the immeasurable riches of his

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.470
race through the kindness to us in Christ.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.110
Jesus for you are saved
by grace through faith.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.210
And this is not like yourself.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.350
It is a God's gift, not for the
work so that no one can boast for.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.640
We are his workmanship created
in Christ Jesus for good works,

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.710
which God prepared at a time.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.390
Let's stop and pray.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.200
Lord Jesus.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.340
We thank you for who you are
and how you brought it to one

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.120
of us here today in the world.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.600
I know this that every one of
us were meant to be hearing.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.630
And so Lord, I just think you're a
general person, Lord, open their hearts

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.920
and minds to what you have to say.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.810
All of us will be transformed to take a
next step, whatever that is, the mortgage,

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.360
the conversation that they can start.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.610
Maybe it's a step closer
to their faith in you.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.630
Maybe it's a step in a direction,
Lord, this is a big step of faith.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.610
I don't know what it is, but you do.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.750
And I pray that you reveal that to them.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.780
Each one of us, including myself and
the word apprentice in your handling.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.600
So the first thing we're going
to see is that our tests.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.090
Consist of the first thing, our
spiritual condition before crops.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.390
This is what we're going to see
here in this first couple of verses.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.570
So to truly understand who
we are in Christ, we have to

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.490
recognize what were before him.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.220
So let me just make this statement a
little bit more, to be as clear as I can.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.040
If you haven't given your mind to Christ,
this still applies to all of us, right?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.700
If you've given your life to Christ, you
know what you've worked with cross that

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.690
you've had given electric rise, you know
what your conditioning is roast, and

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.880
here's the things we're all in the same.

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:38.940
Knowing that we need to take
a next step in our field.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.969
So the first day of realizing
this first verse, it's our

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:43.500
spiritual condition before Christ.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.430
We were dead.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.330
It's clear here, right?

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.280
It says you were dead in your trespasses.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.680
And since this is an
easy one for me, right?

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.020
Not dead physically, because
if I was looking in this

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.340
room, you guys are breathing.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.210
Good news.

00:07:54.719 --> 00:07:56.010
You a lot of man.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.190
I'm so glad that I don't
want that on my record.

00:07:58.289 --> 00:07:59.490
So please leaps.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.450
But here's what he's talking
about to be spiritually.

00:08:04.544 --> 00:08:05.744
So, what does it mean to be spiritual?

00:08:05.744 --> 00:08:12.164
Again, it's the same characteristics as
to be physically, so physically dead.

00:08:12.164 --> 00:08:15.885
You have no clue you haven't experienced
this, but you have seen some way

00:08:15.965 --> 00:08:20.054
because we did probably, they don't
know what's happening around them.

00:08:20.114 --> 00:08:23.534
They don't understand your condition
because they're not the only people

00:08:23.534 --> 00:08:25.085
that do is that know that they're dead.

00:08:25.094 --> 00:08:25.455
Right.

00:08:25.664 --> 00:08:28.755
But that person who is physically dead
does not understand the condition.

00:08:28.815 --> 00:08:31.544
That person who is spiritually dead,
does not fully understand that.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.969
So the only person that can
come to wise spiritually is

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:38.849
that Jesus referred to his dad.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.909
And we're going to talk more
about, see God draws people.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.660
And today God's doing that here in this
room and you drawing people to come from

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.750
death spiritually to life spiritually.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.020
So here's the question.

00:08:50.099 --> 00:08:51.660
What caused that debt?

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:58.140
Well, it says, it clearly says our
trespasses, incense, what is a sin?

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.630
And I shared this with a kid,
as soon as anything we think.

00:09:01.605 --> 00:09:03.675
Don't do the displays and stuff.

00:09:03.855 --> 00:09:04.214
Thanks.

00:09:04.214 --> 00:09:07.905
Hey, don't you, so you
can say it this way.

00:09:07.995 --> 00:09:09.855
It's missing tomorrow, right?

00:09:09.885 --> 00:09:10.855
Here's another one, man.

00:09:10.885 --> 00:09:15.015
I'd love to be able to share it this way,
because I think it helps when we sin.

00:09:15.314 --> 00:09:18.975
And this is believers when we
sin, it's not God's best for us.

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:21.314
I asked the question a lot.

00:09:21.555 --> 00:09:23.025
Do you want to raise hands?

00:09:23.025 --> 00:09:28.035
Do you want God's best frame prints
are the majority of what God's best

00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:30.405
for us, but we choose the second.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.180
And again, it's not, God's sitting here
saying, oh man, yo, I don't like you.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:36.570
I hate you.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.400
What'd he say to actually
have something more for you?

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:43.020
So when we live in our sense of trespass
is we are not experiencing God's best.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:43.770
So we were dead.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.400
But the second thing, our spiritual
condition before Christ was that we were

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.140
disobedient to see this in verses two and
three, let's read verses two and three.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.640
It says, I'll read verse one with it.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.180
It says then you were dead in
your trespasses and sins in, would

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.920
you previously live in a wasted.

00:09:59.745 --> 00:10:02.205
According to the ruler of the
power of the mirror in the spirit.

00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:06.255
Now working in the disobedient, do all
previously live the moment and flush

00:10:06.255 --> 00:10:07.305
things are as almost stopped, right?

00:10:07.305 --> 00:10:14.115
There is we understand that we were
obviously disobedient right in that,

00:10:14.145 --> 00:10:16.665
that makes sense, because we all,
probably, if you're in this room,

00:10:16.665 --> 00:10:18.194
you brought kids or grandkids.

00:10:18.435 --> 00:10:19.845
We have kids that do things wrong.

00:10:19.845 --> 00:10:23.025
We understand what the service needs
is not listening to the parents, but

00:10:23.025 --> 00:10:25.725
there's three things that encourage
this disobedience specifically to

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.194
spiritual, spiritual disobedience.

00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:27.915
And he talks about this.

00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:32.324
He says first the three things they
encourage our disobedience is the

00:10:32.324 --> 00:10:36.584
world, the pressures to conform to
the values and attitudes of the world.

00:10:36.824 --> 00:10:41.655
I just take it as the world at times
is leading us in the wrong direction,

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:46.515
away from a guy that's just time away
for what God's best is for our lives.

00:10:46.635 --> 00:10:48.194
Number two, he talks about beginning.

00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:49.694
What all parents do is the devil.

00:10:49.724 --> 00:10:55.604
He influences will leavers and unbelievers
with wise believers and been the enemy is

00:10:55.604 --> 00:10:57.635
here to steal, kill, and destroy anything.

00:10:58.995 --> 00:10:59.775
Well, how do we know this?

00:10:59.805 --> 00:11:00.645
What's a great example.

00:11:00.675 --> 00:11:03.765
How many, we're the first ones
to experience the enemy, seeing

00:11:03.855 --> 00:11:04.845
that they could eat the fruit.

00:11:04.875 --> 00:11:09.135
That was not right, but how many can
go a little bit further with this?

00:11:09.525 --> 00:11:12.944
They can take up this artist
statement that the enemy you would

00:11:12.944 --> 00:11:15.885
think once to just kill people,
why he wants to destroy people.

00:11:16.334 --> 00:11:21.495
Ultimately, the community's best
tactic is to distract because

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:25.365
you're more valuable to him
physically alive spirits instructor.

00:11:25.755 --> 00:11:26.505
I'll say that again.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:28.380
He's ready to attack.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:33.600
It's not destroying, but it's distracting
because if he's distracting you and you're

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.730
not accomplishing God's plan for him.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.030
So sometimes I think we think that
the devil's going to come out and

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.890
meeting's going to come out and
he's going to be very noticeable.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.970
Typically, he's going to look very similar
to those things around, but he's going to

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.720
distract you from what God's calling you.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.090
How do we know what God's called us to do?

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.490
The word of God gives us clearly
what God's called us to do.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.640
Number one is love
throwing heart and soul.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.069
It's a love your neighbors yourself.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.960
I think those are two great
things that God's called us to

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.000
do that kind of covers the duty.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.010
But why aren't we thinking about this?

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.760
He also talks about the third thing that
causes us to encourage us to do so is

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.819
the flesh meaning what is the flesh?

00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:13.020
It's our fallen nature that we're
born with that wants to disobey God.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:19.230
Every person in this room has fleshly
desires that pulls them away from God.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.050
Every one of us, it's our
ancient great example.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.370
Anybody been around, you know, wow.

00:12:24.405 --> 00:12:26.635
Especially with what my surname was about.

00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:30.435
Natural desire is to be greater, right?

00:12:30.615 --> 00:12:31.905
That's their natural desire.

00:12:32.055 --> 00:12:35.055
What our natural desire is to be selfish.

00:12:35.445 --> 00:12:37.725
So a lot of times when we talk
about sin, we talk about that.

00:12:37.725 --> 00:12:39.345
We have my home, it's me.

00:12:39.735 --> 00:12:41.205
And it's you, it's all of us.

00:12:41.475 --> 00:12:45.215
There's not a person who's grieving that
has not said every one of us has said.

00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:46.335
So we're all in the same condition.

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:47.385
We're all in the same place.

00:12:48.405 --> 00:12:51.255
And so you ever wonder
at times why we choose.

00:12:53.385 --> 00:12:57.385
I know I asked that question why at times,
and when I choose wrong, when I know it's

00:12:57.385 --> 00:13:00.765
smaller, I know it's, , it's our major.

00:13:02.084 --> 00:13:02.895
And here's the thing.

00:13:03.194 --> 00:13:07.484
As a believer, God has given us
the spirit of God to help guide

00:13:07.484 --> 00:13:08.954
us, to choose against that nature.

00:13:09.285 --> 00:13:13.245
But as an unbeliever, we
haven't got the opportunity.

00:13:13.275 --> 00:13:15.604
You haven't got the opportunity
to have the gut guide.

00:13:15.604 --> 00:13:17.204
You're looking to protect
you from the nature.

00:13:18.915 --> 00:13:20.594
So we continued on the next thing, right?

00:13:20.655 --> 00:13:21.224
It talks about that.

00:13:21.224 --> 00:13:24.255
We were doing in chambers three
diverse universe, three systems.

00:13:24.344 --> 00:13:27.795
We do all take us and lived among them
and our fleshly desires, carrying out the

00:13:27.795 --> 00:13:29.655
declination nations and flushing thoughts.

00:13:29.834 --> 00:13:35.564
And we were by nature children under
wrath, as others were also here

00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:37.395
is a difficult part of the text.

00:13:37.604 --> 00:13:40.185
He says your children on your breath.

00:13:40.545 --> 00:13:45.974
Short-stay before we come to
Christ, we are children of Daniel.

00:13:47.114 --> 00:13:49.125
Oh, man, that sounds so horrible.

00:13:49.155 --> 00:13:53.444
Here's think he's using those
who don't know Christ to be able

00:13:53.444 --> 00:13:55.395
to distract a role from Christ.

00:13:56.025 --> 00:14:00.495
So we, before coming to price our
children under the heading in, it's

00:14:00.495 --> 00:14:02.114
difficult to hear that it's hard to grasp.

00:14:02.805 --> 00:14:08.415
And so we are headed towards judgment that
we cannot change, but God is not done.

00:14:08.444 --> 00:14:12.285
That's the part that I love about this
at some point, all of us understand

00:14:12.285 --> 00:14:13.995
is that everyone was just room, Mrs.

00:14:15.525 --> 00:14:16.064
. Every one of them.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.340
Struggles with something we all have had
stayed in my life and struggle with that.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.070
So this is what I love
about church church.

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:27.180
Isn't about separation church is about,
Hey, we come together because we are

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:32.910
broken and we need each other to seek
God's word, to find out what God's called

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.010
us to do and recognize her condition.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.660
Cause here's the thing truth be told.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.810
So, you know, as a pastor there's
days, I come in here on Sundays and

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.900
I'm broken and you know what I mean?

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.010
What do you mean.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:01.439
and that's not, maybe that's just me
recognizing, because we don't recognize at

00:15:04.709 --> 00:15:06.869
church not to come to the perfect.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.790
To answer questions.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.330
And sometimes we're not
going to come to conclusions.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.400
There's days that I walk in here
and you're not going to get the

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.650
answer that you need, and we're
going to walk alongside you.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:20.160
You're going to walk alongside me to help
discover natural because it is a process.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:20.910
It's a journey.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:25.319
And that's the thing that I love about
this church and about what we're seeing

00:15:25.319 --> 00:15:26.910
here are conditioned before us, right?

00:15:26.939 --> 00:15:30.300
Our test participants, is there
a condition before Christ, but

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:30.990
here's the beautiful thing.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.860
God, didn't leave us here.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.160
Part of our testimony, he says our
spiritual transformation through.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.080
So let's look at verse four, he says,
but God, until you understand what this,

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.650
that is not to teas, this is not sorry.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.780
I know that sounds bad, but
that's something that they kind

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.160
of say, but God, but it's not.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.050
But he says, look, I've been stuck.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.190
Everything stops, stop.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.390
God is not gonna leave
you in that condition.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.160
Your spirit tradition before Christ.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.040
He says, I love you too
much to leave you there.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.440
So he stops everything and
he says, you don't have.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:09.960
Let's continue on, but God who
is rich in mercy because of his

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.180
great love that he has for us.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.310
This focus now turns from us to Christ.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.340
It puts the art condition on his back.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.670
Here's four things that God did for
us or things that God did for us.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:24.540
Number one, he loves us.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.530
We sold that first port.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:29.070
God's love is translated
to us in grace and mercy.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.140
He loved us first by giving us mercy.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.280
So what is mercy?

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.780
It's not giving us.

00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:36.855
Not giving us what we deserve.

00:16:37.005 --> 00:16:37.485
Right?

00:16:37.545 --> 00:16:38.535
What do we deserve?

00:16:38.595 --> 00:16:40.095
Because we've said we're
separated from God.

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:40.785
We deserve.

00:16:40.845 --> 00:16:43.515
And in terms of immigration from
him, that's what we deserve.

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:46.335
But God said, I'm not going to
give you that condition because I

00:16:46.335 --> 00:16:48.615
love, so let me ask this question.

00:16:48.615 --> 00:16:52.925
Anybody ever had a parent, they had
every right to punish you for something

00:16:52.935 --> 00:16:54.105
you did, but they chose to withhold it.

00:16:54.195 --> 00:16:58.995
Anybody, maybe your parent never, that.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.400
Let me, let me just step a little bit
further, get rid of had somebody, a

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.380
police officer pull you over, maybe
in Hamilton, they pull you over.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.090
They had every right to give you to take
it because you're going five over 10 over.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.310
You're not wearing your seatbelt,
your lights out, whatever it is, they

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:12.720
have every right to give you a ticket.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.890
And then she not to, you know
what that's called Marcy.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.850
So God had every right to pour out
and punishment on us because we sin.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.569
But he chose not to because
that's how loving God is.

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:27.380
He wants to extend.

00:17:28.095 --> 00:17:31.455
Every single time that I've chosen to get
my kids mercy it's because I love them.

00:17:31.845 --> 00:17:36.315
And I want them to see that love and
then appreciate my love for them so much

00:17:36.315 --> 00:17:40.365
that they'll choose to not necessarily
they'll choose to listen to what I say.

00:17:40.425 --> 00:17:44.295
And I'll let you know this as a parent,
every single time that I tell my children

00:17:44.295 --> 00:17:46.515
not to do something is to protect them.

00:17:47.805 --> 00:17:50.385
How loving is a God that
wants to protect you.

00:17:51.615 --> 00:17:54.195
He's wanting to protect you
from sin, not your best.

00:17:54.435 --> 00:17:55.445
He wants to give you what is.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:18:00.075
So whenever you see these, these things
like, oh man, God doesn't love me.

00:18:00.284 --> 00:18:03.855
He just wants the judge
to know all of us so much.

00:18:04.575 --> 00:18:07.245
So the next thing we see as a
spiritual transformation through

00:18:07.245 --> 00:18:11.745
Christ, again, four things that guy
did, he loved us and he made us alive.

00:18:11.895 --> 00:18:12.165
Right.

00:18:12.195 --> 00:18:14.595
He made us alive, got on
when she was mercy, but he

00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:16.065
extends verse this verse five.

00:18:16.635 --> 00:18:20.565
He says this, he says ma um, I'll kind
of go with foreign life, but God who is

00:18:20.565 --> 00:18:22.145
rich in mercy because of his great love.

00:18:23.129 --> 00:18:26.550
Made us alive with Christ,
even though we were dead in our

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.250
trespasses, you are saved by grace.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.460
So we not only since mercy,
but he extends grace race is

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.020
giving us what we don't deserve.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.980
There's times.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.550
I'm just telling you this there's times
my kids have acted horrible urine today.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:41.879
Not looking at my child over there.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:47.010
You know, sometimes we do, we give
them breaks and we go get ice cream.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.389
They don't deserve ice cream.

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:51.450
They don't, but we love them so much.

00:18:52.275 --> 00:18:57.675
There's times where we give them what they
don't deserve, because we love so God,

00:18:57.735 --> 00:18:59.715
rather than to say, Hey, you've sinned.

00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:00.345
I'm done with you.

00:19:00.435 --> 00:19:00.975
He says, no.

00:19:01.965 --> 00:19:04.275
And I'm extending grace
by extending grace.

00:19:04.395 --> 00:19:05.655
We had the ability to be saved.

00:19:06.555 --> 00:19:10.125
I say, listen to this, this critical
piece that I wrote out here, I want

00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:11.895
to make sure I got this word mercy.

00:19:11.895 --> 00:19:16.275
And grace came to us because
Jesus took the punishment of our

00:19:16.275 --> 00:19:20.895
sins and gave up what he gave
us, which is life just gave up.

00:19:21.854 --> 00:19:27.104
So that we can have spiritual need,
want to follow a God who loves him so

00:19:27.104 --> 00:19:31.485
much that he would take my place, that I
deserved the punishment and give me life.

00:19:32.445 --> 00:19:35.925
I remember thinking about this there's
moments whenever my dad would punish me.

00:19:36.524 --> 00:19:39.165
And again, well-deserved, and
I'd be sitting there because

00:19:39.165 --> 00:19:40.965
he'd say go in the other room,
I'll be in there just a minute.

00:19:41.445 --> 00:19:44.264
And man, all that, Amston
just worry about that.

00:19:44.264 --> 00:19:44.854
What's going to happen.

00:19:46.545 --> 00:19:49.545
We don't have to worry about that
anymore because God so loves us

00:19:49.545 --> 00:19:50.705
that he's given us grace and mercy.

00:19:50.745 --> 00:19:54.615
We don't have to fear punishment anymore
because of what God's done for us.

00:19:55.005 --> 00:19:57.795
So again, he made us our spiritual
transformation through Christ.

00:19:57.825 --> 00:20:01.305
The next thing he did is he exalted us
at verse six, verse six, says this, and

00:20:01.305 --> 00:20:06.435
he also raises up with him and seated us
with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus.

00:20:06.795 --> 00:20:10.305
So we have been brought back to life
and placed an honor, not just brought

00:20:10.305 --> 00:20:12.045
back to life and just made mediocre.

00:20:12.165 --> 00:20:12.525
He has.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.440
You didn't have in our position
has changed from children of

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.390
the enemy to children of God.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.700
We are now alive because
of what Jesus did.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.070
And the next couple of
verses, he talks about that.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.260
He keeps us so verse seven says this.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.010
It says, so that in the coming
ages, he might display his

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.910
immeasurable riches of grace through
his kindness to us in Christ.

00:20:34.455 --> 00:20:38.295
God's purpose in our salvation is
more than record rescue us from hell.

00:20:38.535 --> 00:20:42.225
I want to be as clear as I can be
so many times at times we'll accept

00:20:42.225 --> 00:20:44.295
Jesus and we think we're good.

00:20:44.925 --> 00:20:45.555
I'm good.

00:20:45.585 --> 00:20:50.175
It's all about me, but God
saved you for the purpose.

00:20:50.175 --> 00:20:53.235
So go back to what I said, minibus
one, or know where, you know what

00:20:53.235 --> 00:20:54.905
you're creating designed by God.

00:20:54.915 --> 00:20:57.105
So we talked about this
week with a purpose.

00:20:57.855 --> 00:20:58.125
Yes.

00:20:58.125 --> 00:20:59.175
Every one of us.

00:20:59.295 --> 00:21:00.405
And this is what he's saying here.

00:21:00.615 --> 00:21:02.925
He wants to show the surpassing
riches of this world.

00:21:03.675 --> 00:21:07.395
And kindness to us and everybody
that we come in contact with.

00:21:07.635 --> 00:21:09.315
He wants everyone to know.

00:21:09.675 --> 00:21:11.715
So God didn't just save you for you.

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:17.145
He saved you for everyone so that you
could be on display to those around us.

00:21:17.505 --> 00:21:22.425
Our life is purposeful and want you
to know that your life has purpose.

00:21:22.455 --> 00:21:25.725
No matter what you've done in the
past, God can redeem that and use

00:21:25.725 --> 00:21:27.975
that or others to come to know him.

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:31.455
And to know God personally, I was
challenged with this statement.

00:21:32.985 --> 00:21:35.745
There's someone waiting on the
other side, your openings or

00:21:35.745 --> 00:21:37.875
your yes, to take that next step.

00:21:38.235 --> 00:21:40.305
And when you take that next
step and minds will be changed.

00:21:40.335 --> 00:21:42.105
That's why we do what we do as a church.

00:21:42.284 --> 00:21:44.205
Lies will be changed because we know that.

00:21:44.745 --> 00:21:45.945
So he talks about a verse seven.

00:21:46.155 --> 00:21:50.145
You are saved by grace through
faith, and this is not of yourself.

00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:55.485
It's God's gift saved by grace
means salvation apart from any

00:21:55.485 --> 00:21:57.885
merit or work what's on our report.

00:21:58.455 --> 00:22:00.284
Our salvation is a gift, not a reward.

00:22:00.284 --> 00:22:01.065
And let me just clarify.

00:22:02.265 --> 00:22:04.425
Our salvation is a gift number.

00:22:04.425 --> 00:22:07.065
The word reward is for doing something.

00:22:08.505 --> 00:22:11.355
Salvation is a gift for what he did.

00:22:12.435 --> 00:22:13.575
I'm reminded every time.

00:22:13.575 --> 00:22:18.645
When I think about a gift, the gift that
is given to us was it given freely to us?

00:22:18.825 --> 00:22:20.625
What does he really like willingly?

00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:25.425
And when we receive that gift, we open it
up and we receive salvation relationship

00:22:25.425 --> 00:22:26.745
with God and it turned into heaven.

00:22:26.835 --> 00:22:28.925
He gave it not to be kept, but to be.

00:22:30.315 --> 00:22:32.625
That gift that God has given
you is meant to be given away

00:22:32.805 --> 00:22:33.825
because you were the Bible.

00:22:34.875 --> 00:22:38.625
So our make our faith, and I want to
be clear that this, our faith was not

00:22:38.625 --> 00:22:40.365
a means by which we received grace.

00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:40.955
Instead.

00:22:40.965 --> 00:22:41.905
Grace was a means.

00:22:42.495 --> 00:22:42.855
Okay.

00:22:43.245 --> 00:22:43.935
And what is faith?

00:22:44.835 --> 00:22:48.135
Faith is complete trust and competence
in what Jesus did on the cross.

00:22:48.825 --> 00:22:52.725
So verse nine, he says this not
from work so that no one can vote.

00:22:52.754 --> 00:22:53.355
Right?

00:22:53.445 --> 00:22:57.284
He says, this salvation that
we received is not from works.

00:22:57.405 --> 00:22:57.995
So no one can.

00:22:58.695 --> 00:23:01.575
The biggest thing with this is
why did God choose to save us

00:23:01.575 --> 00:23:02.955
without us having to work for it?

00:23:03.405 --> 00:23:04.514
Because it's not about us.

00:23:04.544 --> 00:23:06.764
It's not about what, what
we bring to the table.

00:23:07.305 --> 00:23:10.305
I think so many times we think if
we just do 51% good, that's when

00:23:10.305 --> 00:23:12.195
God saves us and sends us the head.

00:23:12.735 --> 00:23:13.425
We're good.

00:23:13.605 --> 00:23:16.875
No, he says I don't want, that's
not, that's not a matter to me.

00:23:17.175 --> 00:23:18.315
It's not by good works.

00:23:18.585 --> 00:23:19.605
God wants the glory.

00:23:19.635 --> 00:23:21.555
That's God's gift to us.

00:23:22.065 --> 00:23:24.135
So I know some of you may be
saying, are we almost done?

00:23:24.165 --> 00:23:24.885
Yes, we're almost done.

00:23:25.065 --> 00:23:25.245
Okay.

00:23:25.274 --> 00:23:25.665
That's good.

00:23:25.665 --> 00:23:25.965
We're on that.

00:23:27.014 --> 00:23:29.475
You talking about versus one verse
10, we're on the verse that we

00:23:29.475 --> 00:23:31.425
learned this week for the kids.

00:23:31.875 --> 00:23:33.524
And I want to read this
verse to you in verse 10.

00:23:34.905 --> 00:23:37.905
Is this for, we are his workmanship
created in Christ Jesus for

00:23:37.905 --> 00:23:40.395
good works, which God prepared
ahead of time for us to do.

00:23:41.145 --> 00:23:43.335
I want to translate the
word workmanship for you.

00:23:43.695 --> 00:23:44.895
There's a couple of versions.

00:23:45.105 --> 00:23:48.135
As you begin to look at this,
the word workmanship can be

00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:49.935
changed into masterpiece.

00:23:49.965 --> 00:23:51.014
Another way to describe it.

00:23:51.585 --> 00:23:55.455
So we are God's masterpiece,
somebody named a famous.

00:23:56.324 --> 00:23:58.304
Some of the story.

00:23:58.304 --> 00:24:03.375
Now, last one more Mona Lisa, right?

00:24:03.435 --> 00:24:10.564
These are all famous masterpieces and
they take time and they're very, very

00:24:10.564 --> 00:24:14.415
valuable when you change that word.

00:24:14.514 --> 00:24:19.695
We're God's workmanship, but
we are God's masterpiece.

00:24:19.814 --> 00:24:20.355
Oh my gosh.

00:24:20.355 --> 00:24:24.675
That changes everything
because God views you as a man.

00:24:26.295 --> 00:24:30.585
And most of those masterpieces that
we list, there's no value to get

00:24:30.585 --> 00:24:34.055
them because they are so diagonal
that you can't even put a price.

00:24:34.695 --> 00:24:39.495
Plus, that's a lovely,
we are his masterpiece.

00:24:39.495 --> 00:24:42.615
We can't miss your, his greatest ration.

00:24:43.265 --> 00:24:46.955
God has done all the work in ethic
continues to work in us to turn

00:24:46.955 --> 00:24:48.395
us into more of this masterpiece.

00:24:48.605 --> 00:24:51.365
How does God make a masterpiece?

00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:55.649
By growing us up to know more and more
like him at the end of the, our lives.

00:24:55.649 --> 00:24:57.929
Our masterpiece turns
into the image of price.

00:24:57.929 --> 00:24:59.429
We reflect who Christ is.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.750
And that's when we know that we have
complete masterpiece that he has for us.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.419
What does he use to make
us into that masterpiece?

00:25:06.419 --> 00:25:07.500
He uses his word.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.030
He uses prayer.

00:25:09.899 --> 00:25:12.270
He uses the gospel, the good
news of Christ to change our

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.580
lives and uses mercy race.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.050
There's something that I want to mention.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.429
And I think this is a tough one.

00:25:17.429 --> 00:25:19.800
You know what God sometimes
uses, who uses suffering?

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.360
Why would God have you.

00:25:22.649 --> 00:25:24.120
I guess here's the other
thing I was looking for.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:29.250
If you don't have a relationship with
chronic suffering as a setback, because

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.290
apart from Christ, we're living this life.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.690
And if this life ends quick because of
suffering, then I have not succeeded

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.570
because success is to make a dollar
101, I don't know, somebody told me

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.520
that success is to make the wonder hut.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.220
You know, you make all the money,
you can get all the things you can

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.780
that success this side of heaven.

00:25:46.649 --> 00:25:51.300
But when suffering comes in, when setbacks
come in, you're set off track, but.

00:25:52.035 --> 00:25:55.035
God's world suffering can be redeemed.

00:25:55.485 --> 00:26:00.345
Suffering can be used to no God
wanting to paint them on guidance.

00:26:00.345 --> 00:26:01.125
Seen this.

00:26:01.155 --> 00:26:01.875
This is what I would say.

00:26:01.905 --> 00:26:03.135
We are designed by God.

00:26:03.525 --> 00:26:07.905
Another one of those kbps versus
we're designed by God, not at the

00:26:07.905 --> 00:26:09.465
school, but for the polar cap.

00:26:09.885 --> 00:26:12.675
So our suffering, it can bring
honor him and really wise, and

00:26:12.675 --> 00:26:14.205
also a closer relationship to him.

00:26:14.475 --> 00:26:16.935
We've seen that in our church
through so many people were

00:26:16.935 --> 00:26:18.315
suffering is not a setback.

00:26:18.795 --> 00:26:19.765
You know, what's part of the purpose.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.780
So God only works in us, but he
wants to work through us, right?

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.490
So he created us unto good works.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.060
And it says this at the back part
of that verse, he says, we created

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.640
this impress Jesus for good works,
which he prepared ahead of time.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.390
John Tom in the state, he says it
is faith alone with justifies, which

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:38.220
means it gives you your space along.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.190
It makes you allows you to
be safe, but that day that

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:42.390
justifies can never be alone.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.910
This means we need to be workers.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.340
We need to go and shine
the light of Jesus.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.400
So our good works are a
testimony to the world.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:57.240
So I want to end with this, these 10
verses our picture of our texts, right?

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.170
It's a picture of our Testament.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.950
Some of us like the experience, know
if you're like the four price, tell

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.160
me to price and your like, impress,
which means those of you raised

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.020
your hand and said, you know what?

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.140
God's called you to do your
purpose of what your next step is.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.860
You know that, but for some of us
we'll somewhere on our last, before

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.900
promised it would came to practical.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.040
We have not been living in.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.910
But we've been living on her fate, but
we don't know where our next step is.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.230
What do we do?

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.340
How do we take that next step?

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:25.320
I want to share this with you.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.350
I want you to think through
this, everybody here has a stuff.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.120
Maybe again, you, haven't given your a
to cross and you realized that you need

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.720
to, but that's something I can give
you the light that God is cultural.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:37.580
You can do that.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:41.460
Maybe you are in this room and you
have given out the price and you

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.890
know that you just haven't been
living out the purpose of the gospel.

00:27:45.629 --> 00:27:49.170
That's part of our church's mission
is to help you take that next step.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.690
Maybe you're living your life
completely out of the cross.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.420
There are no next step to take
that's a lot because you can

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:58.920
teach others to take, you'd be a
part of helping to change those.

00:27:59.879 --> 00:28:02.220
So I challenge you with this thing
and I want to, I want to finish, I

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.710
know you guys probably wondering,
what am I going to finish here?

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.450
I ask these two questions.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.170
Do you believe that God has a
plan for the majority, majority

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.230
of the raise your hand, but do you
know how to take that next step?

00:28:15.615 --> 00:28:17.264
The only way have lots of Genix days.

00:28:17.355 --> 00:28:24.195
If you asked them to save you or to
call you or to give you a church,

00:28:24.225 --> 00:28:26.955
body, or somebody to come alongside
you and encourage you and your faith.

00:28:27.014 --> 00:28:28.814
And I want you to know that's our church.

00:28:29.324 --> 00:28:30.675
We want to help you take that next step.

00:28:30.705 --> 00:28:32.445
That's why we have something
called the next steps table.

00:28:32.745 --> 00:28:35.985
We're here to walk alongside
here's the, you're a church member.

00:28:36.105 --> 00:28:37.094
You're part of inspiring hope.

00:28:37.185 --> 00:28:37.695
Ready?

00:28:38.294 --> 00:28:40.215
You have a next step to too many times.

00:28:40.215 --> 00:28:43.185
We sit here and look around,
but it's us too, including your.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.000
But I'm going to ask you this question.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.290
What's my stick step of faith.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.200
I want to, I want to finish
with this and this is my thing.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.360
I really want you guys, as you get your
hearts ready, and we're going to have

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.000
something called invitation invitation.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.520
It's just an opportunity to respond to
what God's taught us in the word today.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:58.530
There's no forced response in this.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.630
This is something I just want to
be able to have you guys focus.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.910
And so if you don't mind, just
close your eyes to be able to focus.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.970
As I share a few things with you
to consider about what God may

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:07.580
call you to do, what steps you can.

00:29:08.385 --> 00:29:11.925
Um, and again, this is nothing that we're
here to pressure you to do, but more as

00:29:11.925 --> 00:29:14.115
an opportunity for everybody in this room.

00:29:14.805 --> 00:29:19.545
Here's what I know is that God desires
to know simple enough if you're

00:29:19.545 --> 00:29:21.315
in this room and you've already
got you, don't like the price.

00:29:21.675 --> 00:29:22.755
I want you to know this.

00:29:22.815 --> 00:29:24.285
God is ours for you to

00:29:24.285 --> 00:29:24.495
know

00:29:24.495 --> 00:29:30.255
him more, more than what you came
into this room and experienced.

00:29:31.065 --> 00:29:34.155
So as started thinking about
what next steps can I take for

00:29:34.155 --> 00:29:35.465
some of us that needs to be.

00:29:36.975 --> 00:29:38.385
Uh, giving our lives to Jesus.

00:29:38.685 --> 00:29:42.795
If you're unsure, if you've given
your life to Jesus or maybe know

00:29:42.795 --> 00:29:44.745
you have to give your life to Jesus,
but you need to make that next

00:29:44.745 --> 00:29:46.515
step, you need to say yes to Jesus.

00:29:46.665 --> 00:29:47.835
Do you know that you can do that today?

00:29:48.615 --> 00:29:49.505
You can do that today.

00:29:49.575 --> 00:29:51.555
Why were you sitting in,
put your faith in him?

00:29:52.245 --> 00:29:55.125
And you could never look back
to that past life, right?

00:29:55.155 --> 00:29:58.335
That past life where you have been
living for yourself, you've been

00:29:58.335 --> 00:30:03.135
living as a human needs to God, God
desires for you to have what's best,

00:30:03.405 --> 00:30:04.485
which is the relationship with him.

00:30:04.695 --> 00:30:05.295
Here's what the Bible.

00:30:06.075 --> 00:30:11.415
If you'll confess your sins to God,
ask for forgiveness and recognize

00:30:11.445 --> 00:30:15.315
Jesus as the Lord of your life
and give your life to him in line.

00:30:15.615 --> 00:30:17.955
And you believe in your heart, that
Jesus was raised from the dead.

00:30:17.985 --> 00:30:18.555
You'll be saved.

00:30:18.585 --> 00:30:22.095
It says that in the Bible, it's
not about how good you are, but

00:30:22.095 --> 00:30:25.425
it's really about how good God
is by giving me grace and mercy.

00:30:26.835 --> 00:30:28.035
So here's what I want to challenge again.

00:30:28.065 --> 00:30:30.405
I want to do this because I
want to encourage everybody

00:30:30.405 --> 00:30:31.515
as an opportunity to respond.

00:30:31.725 --> 00:30:32.835
If you do have your eyes closed.

00:30:34.245 --> 00:30:36.345
If you would like to give your
life to Christ, there's nobody.

00:30:36.345 --> 00:30:37.605
That's going to make fun of you.

00:30:37.875 --> 00:30:40.665
But I would like to just be able
to pray for you and encourage you

00:30:40.665 --> 00:30:42.585
and walk you through what that
means to give your life to price.

00:30:42.825 --> 00:30:45.805
So if you would like to give your life
to Christ, you raise your hand that

00:30:45.825 --> 00:30:49.635
recognize your need for Christ, and
then we can pray together as a church

00:30:49.965 --> 00:30:51.225
and you can accept Christ together.

00:30:51.225 --> 00:30:53.505
So if you want to give your life
depression, raise your hand again.

00:30:53.535 --> 00:30:54.705
Nobody's going to come over.

00:30:54.705 --> 00:30:56.775
And Brittany said, we're just
going to lead you through a prayer.

00:30:56.775 --> 00:30:59.805
Be able to talk to you about what that
means and talk to you after service.

00:31:10.185 --> 00:31:11.504
so I want to pray with everyone.

00:31:11.925 --> 00:31:12.764
Here's what I would like to do.

00:31:13.725 --> 00:31:14.774
You can keep your eyes closed.

00:31:14.774 --> 00:31:16.514
I want you guys to pray alongside things.

00:31:17.264 --> 00:31:20.024
There's probably somebody in this
room it's difficult at times to be

00:31:20.024 --> 00:31:23.324
bold with your faith, but you know,
you need to give your life to Jesus.

00:31:24.105 --> 00:31:25.334
I want to lead you through a prayer.

00:31:25.334 --> 00:31:27.344
And just so you know, I want
to be as clear as possible.

00:31:27.344 --> 00:31:28.395
This is the type of pastor that.

00:31:29.429 --> 00:31:30.409
Praying a prayer.

00:31:30.479 --> 00:31:38.000
Never say unless you mean when she beat,
but I still won't lead you to repair it.

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:41.100
So I want you to know what it means to
be able to give your life to Christ.

00:31:41.159 --> 00:31:44.129
So what power would like to do this
is our whole church in this room.

00:31:44.189 --> 00:31:44.879
We'll pray.

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:49.409
So as I say, words, I would love for every
one of you to say words out loud with me.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:50.780
Maybe you have a good bullet.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.070
This is the person next to
them to be able to pray boldly,

00:31:53.129 --> 00:31:53.969
to give their lives to you.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.879
So please pray alongside.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.450
So everyone with me, let's pray.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:04.230
Say, dear Jesus, I
recognize that I'm a sinner.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:12.570
Please forgive, come into
my life and changing.

00:32:14.145 --> 00:32:22.455
I believe you've died for my sins and rose
again, I give you my life in Jesus name.

00:32:25.635 --> 00:32:26.685
I want everybody to look it up here.

00:32:26.685 --> 00:32:28.125
I want to encourage you with this.

00:32:28.545 --> 00:32:31.875
If you prayed that prayer
today, and you gave your life to

00:32:31.875 --> 00:32:35.085
Jesus, please understand this.

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:38.415
God has never called you
to live your faith out of.

00:32:40.305 --> 00:32:44.294
I want to be as clear as possible if
you prayed and you believe that God

00:32:44.294 --> 00:32:50.355
is safe, do not leave today before
you combined right after service.

00:32:50.475 --> 00:32:52.365
I want to stand over here
and I to go get your kids.

00:32:52.695 --> 00:32:54.415
I'm going to be over there to come
talk to me and say, Hey, I prayed.

00:32:56.055 --> 00:32:57.435
We want to walk alongside you.

00:32:57.465 --> 00:33:00.405
This is not something that we
want to walk through it alone.

00:33:00.735 --> 00:33:03.105
We are a community, the loveseat.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.840
And so, you know, this,
we love your children.

00:33:07.439 --> 00:33:08.909
We love you.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.810
And you say, Hey, how do you even
know that he's got associates or

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.450
right here in a school in the city?

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:17.939
Because this is where God's called us.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:20.070
Our family was in a wall
and two and half years ago.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:21.990
And a call was here many times I was

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.050
a

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:22.409
fool.

00:33:25.679 --> 00:33:26.550
It's not about us.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.570
It's about Jesus.

00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:28.379
I want to be a part of that.

00:33:30.555 --> 00:33:31.155
At least comes home.

00:33:31.845 --> 00:33:32.895
Here's my last challenge.

00:33:33.495 --> 00:33:34.845
We're going to go to
this type of invitation.

00:33:34.845 --> 00:33:36.585
And if they it's going to little, a
little bit different, because typically

00:33:36.585 --> 00:33:40.575
that's, whenever you do respond to you're
less depressed, but this time everybody

00:33:40.575 --> 00:33:42.075
in the room has already given us Jesus.

00:33:42.075 --> 00:33:44.535
If you gave your life to Jesus, I
want you to ask the Lord in this

00:33:44.535 --> 00:33:46.395
time, or what is my next step?

00:33:46.754 --> 00:33:50.535
How do I take a step out of the gate
to trust you for something more?

00:33:50.685 --> 00:33:54.885
Because you know, the guy has a plain
frame and today my hope is, you know,

00:33:54.885 --> 00:33:56.895
where you are either you're increasing.

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:00.030
And if you're in Christ,
you're living for cross.

00:34:00.179 --> 00:34:05.010
And if you're not, you know where you are,
look at the matter, take the next step.

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.379
I'm here to help you come talk to me.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.350
Wife's here to help you talk to her.

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:11.520
We want to be with you.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.860
I'm going to pray for us and they're
going to see seem you get a time

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.330
to assessable with that these days.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.449
So Lord Jesus, we thank you for today.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:23.549
We thank you for this opportunity
to come and have a BBS celebration

00:34:23.549 --> 00:34:24.210
and the Lord, I don't know.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:26.460
You were here all week.

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:31.259
I saw you Lord in all the moments of
celebration, Lord, I saw you and the

00:34:31.259 --> 00:34:35.159
kids faces when they laughed and they
giggled and they sang songs and they

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:37.679
danced and they entered Bible stories.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:42.239
Lord, I was so encouraged
as I sat there as Mr.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:44.389
Sparks professor sparks.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.279
It's I get to sit there with little
kids, just raising their hand

00:34:47.279 --> 00:34:50.250
and answering things about you.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:50.730
Lord.

00:34:51.299 --> 00:34:53.399
I'm so happy because I saw you.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:35:01.319
But Lord, I saw you today because
I know, I know today that you were

00:35:01.319 --> 00:35:03.779
present and you say where two or three
gathered in my name, you were present.

00:35:04.379 --> 00:35:05.910
So you are amongst us.

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:07.089
You were present.

00:35:07.129 --> 00:35:09.060
We prayed and were present
and was celebrated.

00:35:09.129 --> 00:35:10.440
I got PI in my thirties.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.430
Lord, you were there whenever
we opened your word and read it.

00:35:15.089 --> 00:35:15.690
You were there.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.060
We prayed every Christmas room.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.460
To give their lives to you.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.370
Would I pray that that there's one or two
that hasn't given the last and they prayed

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:26.339
that prayer Lord and they gave their
lives to you go to a credit thing, respond

00:35:26.339 --> 00:35:29.879
both of them, but coming and talking to
me or someone else and letting us know.

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:30.899
So we can walk the side.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.440
You haven't been here all day and
you're going to continue to be with us

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:39.210
as a church because we trust you is in
Jesus is the reason why we are here.

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:42.299
And the reason why we'll continue
to inspire hope in the city,

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.850
because we love this city.

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.720
What you're doing.

00:35:47.325 --> 00:35:50.685
Minister the hearts here today as
they consider or what next step

00:35:50.685 --> 00:35:52.035
they need to take Lord, please.

00:35:52.035 --> 00:35:53.085
Minister to my heart.

00:35:53.385 --> 00:35:54.645
Help me take that next step.

00:35:55.215 --> 00:35:58.065
I want to lead well, or thank you.

00:35:58.905 --> 00:35:59.415
The prisoner.
