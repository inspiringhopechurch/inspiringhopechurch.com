00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.010
Own for is connecting right.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.020
Connecting well, and obviously being more
than just a, Tinder's like we're here

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.850
for ourselves, but here for community.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.740
And so that, just that atmosphere
of community during this

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.860
time, Uh, I love seeing that.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.970
So keep that up.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.920
Um, continue to encourage one another.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.670
It's valuable.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.050
It's beneficial to each one of us.

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.680
I'm so excited to jump
back into the word today.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.530
We will be in first Timothy chapter
four, we'll be starting in verse 11 to.

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:37.394
And we've been walking through the book of
first Timothy, uh, for most of this year.

00:00:37.574 --> 00:00:39.824
Um, it actually be,
fast-tracking here pretty quick.

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:41.144
We'll be done with chapter four today.

00:00:41.144 --> 00:00:43.785
I think next week there's a chance
we cover all of chapter five, cause

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:45.015
it kinda just crunches together.

00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:49.815
Um, but we're been learning a lot through
this book and we chose to the book

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:52.425
of first Timothy as a church because
it's really teaching us a lot about.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:57.305
It's teaching us a lot about a young
church and how to protect the church

00:00:57.305 --> 00:01:00.665
from, uh, being led away from the
faith and making sure that we're

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:03.095
prioritizing growing in Christ.

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:04.444
And so last week we
learned a lot of things.

00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:07.505
I'm gonna kind of catch up on that,
but I love being able to start off

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:12.065
each week, asking questions, getting
you guys engaged, uh, kind of drawing

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:14.675
you into what, where I believe that
Paul's leading us in this message.

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:15.875
And so I want to ask this question.

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:18.215
Have any of you ever had a parent.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.930
We're a boss.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.400
Maybe it's a leader, somebody that's
over, you tell you one thing, but

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.990
then do the complete opposite anybody.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.520
Right.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.960
That if you haven't had that, I would
be surprised because typically what we

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.410
find, and again, I'm a parent too, so
I've probably done it too is don't do

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.380
this, but don't do that or do whatever.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.810
Then they do that.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.520
So, so somebody give me a couple examples.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.060
What is somebody told you not to
do or somebody told you to do?

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.830
And then they went off and
did whatever they wanted.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.640
What's what's a couple of things.

00:01:49.395 --> 00:01:50.205
Yes.

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:52.125
Now I do that as a parent.

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:55.545
You can't have candy after
nine o'clock kids are.

00:01:55.545 --> 00:01:56.655
Yeah, go ahead.

00:02:01.335 --> 00:02:01.804
That's great.

00:02:01.815 --> 00:02:02.715
Well, what do you got?

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.685
Oh, You don't ever do that.

00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:10.215
That is a true fact.

00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:11.235
I've been there for that.

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:13.065
So we, we know those examples, right?

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:15.075
I think we could keep going all day long.

00:02:15.075 --> 00:02:18.705
And some of the things I think about
is, you know, as, as a, as a parent,

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:22.065
a lot of times I remember like don't
cuss, don't smoke, don't drink.

00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:22.575
Right?

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:23.505
Those are easy ones.

00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:27.405
Uh, I also you'll see even parents
to say this, Hey, you go to church.

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:29.505
I remember this being a
part of a student ministry.

00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:31.635
And so many parents would drop off their
kids and say, Hey, you need to be in.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.020
And, but they wouldn't go to church.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.350
Uh, then, then, then let's get
to the bosses side of things

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.160
or leadership side of things.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.490
Right.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.370
Um, here's a couple of things I've
heard is, Hey, don't be on your

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.030
phone during work time yet your
boss is always on their phone.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.390
Right?

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.079
Here's the other one.

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:46.390
Don't be.

00:02:47.505 --> 00:02:50.175
Show up on time, but I'm not
going to show up on time.

00:02:50.175 --> 00:02:50.325
Right.

00:02:50.325 --> 00:02:51.675
So we all know that, right?

00:02:51.675 --> 00:02:55.965
So a lot of times as parents, or
even as leaders or bosses, right.

00:02:55.965 --> 00:02:58.455
We, maybe they say one thing
and then they do another.

00:02:58.455 --> 00:03:01.695
And so one of the things, as Christians,
as Christ, followers, as people who

00:03:01.695 --> 00:03:06.555
represent Christ, it's important
that what we say, we follow up in

00:03:06.555 --> 00:03:10.215
our actions that we don't just hold a
standard for someone or challenge them.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.049
Uh, but then do the opposite.

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.619
And so I know that it's
difficult to follow leaders

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.239
or parents who do this things.

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.380
We all know we make mistakes.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.179
And so some of you may
be like, Hey, that's me.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.149
So this isn't here to like bash you,
but it's here to realize, Hey, we

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:28.380
really understand the importance
as parents, as leaders, or even as

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.100
followers of Jesus, how important it
is to not just say one thing and doing

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.049
the opposite, but to actually say one.

00:03:35.065 --> 00:03:37.075
And then followed up with
our actions in our life.

00:03:37.075 --> 00:03:39.235
And so today we're going
to learn the apostle.

00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:42.025
Paul is the one that wrote this letter
to Timothy his true son in the faith.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:42.235
Right.

00:03:42.235 --> 00:03:43.495
He's trying to encourage him.

00:03:43.975 --> 00:03:46.705
And really today we're going to
learn, this is how we should set the

00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:48.355
example for other believers, right.

00:03:48.355 --> 00:03:51.895
To help them follow Jesus and to
help us in our faith as well, to

00:03:51.895 --> 00:03:53.695
make sure that we're growing in.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.720
And so just to kind of catch
everybody up just last week, I'm

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.590
just gonna that's as far back.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.230
So I'm going to go is the last week
and the beginning of chapter four

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.980
for Paul addressed some specific
things about false teachers, right?

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.540
False teachers are people who are trying
to teach something that is not biblical,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.190
something that is not Christ centered.

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.829
And so a couple of things to
these false teachers were teaching

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.870
these believers in the church.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.159
Remember these false
teachers were in the church.

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.500
They were trying to teach them
to abstain from certain foods

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.659
and also to abstain from.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.310
And so what we learned is that,
uh, God does not say that neither

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.550
again, those things could be
valuable to not eat certain foods.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.490
If that's what you have to do for your
health concerns, or maybe even the

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.210
Bible talks about it being valuable
to not marry, because you can dedicate

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.860
yourself to more to the, to the Lord.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.530
But it's not those things that
justify you before the Lord.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.900
And so these leaders were trying
to do something, what we call

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.060
as Jesus plus something, right.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.260
Jesus plus works.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.050
And so then he challenged Timothy
and he challenged us to be.

00:04:50.075 --> 00:04:52.054
So not only pointing out
these false teachers, right?

00:04:52.054 --> 00:04:55.924
Because we'll be good servants, but
to be nourished by the word so that

00:04:55.924 --> 00:04:57.994
we can nourish other people in that
word, nourish is basically we need

00:04:57.994 --> 00:05:01.804
to be built up in the word so that we
have something to give back to others.

00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:05.015
And he said this, he says that
we need to train and godly.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.110
Right.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.099
Rather than physical training, which
has as little value we should train and

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.840
godliness and godliness is just being
more Christ, like be more like Jesus

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.310
working and growing in our faith to be
more like Jesus and focusing more of

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.230
our time on that than on worldly things.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.719
So that's what we talked about last week.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.080
And so this week is going to kind
of be a continuation of that thought

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.860
as this training in godliness is
not only beneficial for us, but

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.930
it's beneficial for those around us.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.300
When it comes to our relationships
with Christ, we don't grow in

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.300
relationships with Christ just to
get to know Christ better ourselves.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.890
But in the process of doing that,
we influence those around us.

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.640
And that, that to me is one of the
biggest emphasis that I think when

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.320
we, when we lack growing in our
faith, it's not only affecting you.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.719
And again, I think that, that
we should strive for that, but

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.190
it's affecting those around us.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.940
And so Paul's speaking directly
to Timothy, which would be a

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.580
leader or a pastor in the church.

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.789
And so he is specifically talking to
leaders in the church, but we know

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:10.320
this, every one of us in this room is
a leader in some area of your life.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.375
You may say now, I'm not a
boss where you may be a parent.

00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:16.515
So you're leading your home.

00:06:16.785 --> 00:06:17.565
Well, you may be a student.

00:06:18.585 --> 00:06:20.055
Uh, I'm not a boss.

00:06:20.235 --> 00:06:22.455
You're leading the kids
that are younger than you.

00:06:22.485 --> 00:06:24.284
The kids that are around and
you're making an influence.

00:06:24.435 --> 00:06:28.635
So in some form, everybody in this room
is leading someone we're influencing.

00:06:28.635 --> 00:06:30.255
So leadership is influence.

00:06:30.525 --> 00:06:31.245
We're leading someone.

00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:34.485
So this text speaks directly to us.

00:06:34.485 --> 00:06:37.635
And here's the other thing Paul's directly
speaking to Timothy, a leader in the.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.620
To teach others this.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.020
So he's teaching Timothy first
and then Timothy supposed to

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.460
take this and teach the church.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.820
So if you want to listen to this text and
go, oh, but he's just speaking to Timothy.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:48.510
The truth is he's.

00:06:49.365 --> 00:06:51.015
To the church as well and to us.

00:06:51.015 --> 00:06:54.825
So I hope that you lean in today
and see how we can learn that we

00:06:54.825 --> 00:06:56.595
need to set the example, right?

00:06:56.595 --> 00:06:58.815
Not only by our word,
but also by modeling it.

00:06:58.815 --> 00:07:02.445
So let's jump into the text, read it so
that we can kind of get on the same page.

00:07:02.445 --> 00:07:06.825
And so we are, again in first Timothy
chapter four, verse 11, it says

00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:09.975
command and teach these things again,
speaking directly to Timothy from

00:07:09.975 --> 00:07:11.925
Paul command and teach these things.

00:07:11.925 --> 00:07:13.725
Don't let anyone despise you.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.480
But set an example for the
believers in speech and in conduct

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.490
and love and faith and impurity.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.830
Until I come give attention to the
public reading exportation and teaching

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.880
don't neglect, the gift that is in you,
Timothy, it was given to you through

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.590
prophesy with the laying on of hands
by the council of the elders practice.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.060
These things be committed to them so
that your progress may be evident.

00:07:40.145 --> 00:07:43.805
Pay close attention to your life,
your teaching, and persevering these

00:07:43.805 --> 00:07:48.844
things for in doing this, you will
say both yourself and your hearers.

00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:49.775
So let's pray.

00:07:50.465 --> 00:07:51.065
Lord Jesus.

00:07:51.065 --> 00:07:52.625
We are praying Lord that today.

00:07:53.224 --> 00:07:56.675
Uh, Lord, that you speak through me,
Lord, that you speak through your word

00:07:56.765 --> 00:08:00.605
and that you open each one of our hearts
and minds, including my own Lord, help us.

00:08:01.395 --> 00:08:05.055
Not leave here today without hearing
from your word and applying it to our

00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:08.594
lives Lord and beginning to see how you
want to grow us in our face so that we

00:08:08.594 --> 00:08:10.275
can help others in their faith as well.

00:08:10.275 --> 00:08:10.575
Lord.

00:08:11.085 --> 00:08:12.435
So we pray all this in your heavenly name.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:13.515
Amen.

00:08:14.565 --> 00:08:18.165
So the first thing we see
Paul addressing is by helping.

00:08:18.974 --> 00:08:21.405
Ourself we're actually helping others.

00:08:21.794 --> 00:08:25.185
And so he says this, you know, at the
beginning command and teach these things.

00:08:25.215 --> 00:08:26.655
So what things is he talking about?

00:08:26.655 --> 00:08:29.924
He's talking about the things that we
dealt with last week in verses six through

00:08:29.924 --> 00:08:34.544
10, he's saying command and teach these
things that we are to live godly lives.

00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:38.505
But I asked this question last week and
I wanted to bring this question up again.

00:08:38.505 --> 00:08:41.145
I asked in the room and the
majority of you raise your hand.

00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:43.185
So I'm not asking you to raise
your hands again, but I ask this

00:08:43.185 --> 00:08:47.025
question, how many of you would like
to be a part of helping someone else

00:08:47.265 --> 00:08:48.885
grow in their faith spiritually?

00:08:49.515 --> 00:08:50.805
You know, and many of
you raised your hands.

00:08:50.805 --> 00:08:53.505
And I said, how many of you want to not
only help them grow spiritual, but you

00:08:53.505 --> 00:08:56.475
really want to help them not even fall
into some of the traps of the world

00:08:56.475 --> 00:08:58.785
that draws them away from the Lord.

00:08:58.785 --> 00:09:00.645
And, and you're like, yes,
I want to be a part of that.

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:03.224
I said, The Lord has a word for us.

00:09:03.224 --> 00:09:05.115
And I think he, the Lord is
going to continue that right.

00:09:05.115 --> 00:09:09.464
The greatest way to help other
people grow in their faith is

00:09:09.464 --> 00:09:11.295
to pursue godliness ourselves.

00:09:11.745 --> 00:09:13.484
Uh, I've shared this way too many times.

00:09:13.484 --> 00:09:14.324
I'm going to share it again.

00:09:14.714 --> 00:09:17.625
Every single time you get on the plane
and they talk about, if we lose air

00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:22.484
in the cabin, mass will drop down,
put yours on first, before you put

00:09:22.484 --> 00:09:26.234
someone else's on the only way that
we can help other people grow in

00:09:26.234 --> 00:09:28.334
their faith to live more like Christ.

00:09:29.204 --> 00:09:32.564
Is to be fed ourselves and
to, to live it out ourselves.

00:09:32.564 --> 00:09:36.675
And so when we talk about this last
week, we talked about living godly lives.

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:41.625
Again, Christ-like lives training and
godliness, but here's the challenge.

00:09:41.925 --> 00:09:44.535
We will not drift towards godliness.

00:09:45.225 --> 00:09:47.025
It's going to take pursuit.

00:09:47.415 --> 00:09:48.885
And that's why he says to train.

00:09:49.635 --> 00:09:52.454
And whenever I think about training,
I think about my kids in soccer.

00:09:52.454 --> 00:09:55.515
I actually coach a group of eight
and nine year olds yesterday.

00:09:55.755 --> 00:09:57.615
I really was seeking the Lord
because we had a tough game.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.729
I thought the rest were wrong.

00:09:59.729 --> 00:10:03.150
And I thought there was a lot of other
things wrong, but the Lord convicted

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.890
me not to be rude, but nevertheless,
these kids here's usually what happens.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.390
Practices on Tuesdays.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.640
A lot of kids don't like
to show up to practice.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.109
A lot of the kids don't
like to run a practice.

00:10:13.109 --> 00:10:16.859
A lot of the kids don't like
practice the game time coach.

00:10:16.859 --> 00:10:17.520
I want to play.

00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:20.729
I want to win the game and
they're upset when they don't win.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.390
Well, here's what happens
is a lot of times games are.

00:10:25.229 --> 00:10:25.979
At practice.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.459
If you guys know the legend,
John wooden, John wooden used to

00:10:29.609 --> 00:10:31.229
coach a team, I think was UCLA.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.510
And then when so many championships
and he says this, I enjoy

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.650
practice more than games.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.589
He said, somebody asked him the
question, why he said, because

00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:38.790
games are won at practice.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.120
He says, if we do everything right
in practice, whatever the outcome

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.729
of the game winner lose, we've
done everything we can to win.

00:10:45.719 --> 00:10:46.979
So I'm not trying to be worldly with this.

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:48.839
I'm trying to bring this
back to the word of God.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.569
If we go back to this question,
do you want to help other

00:10:51.569 --> 00:10:52.560
people grow in their faith?

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.699
Do you want to grow in your.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.240
Well, it starts with
training and godliness.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.750
It means learning more about who God
is and beginning to grow in our faith.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:05.250
So we have to help others
by helping ourselves first.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:10.590
So every day, if we want to help
others go into the faith, what are

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:12.180
we doing to prepare ourselves for it?

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.340
How are we pursuing godliness?

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.480
Here's the truth.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.360
We live what we believe, not what we say.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:18.990
I'm going to say this again.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.460
We live what we believe, not what.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.030
So today you're saying, Hey,
I want to pursue godliness.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.470
I want to help others grow in their faith.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.480
Then back that up with how you did it.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.070
And this is the cool part we're
gonna learn from this today.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.260
Timothy got challenged on
how to begin to do that.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.030
And that's what we're going
to see here in verse 11.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.210
So Paul says command and teach these
things from verses six through 10,

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:40.230
how to train in godliness and not
spend so much time on worldly things,

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.380
but he says in order to command
and teach these things effective.

00:11:44.355 --> 00:11:46.605
You need to set the example for the
believers and you'll see this in

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:50.475
verse 12, he says, don't let anyone
despise your youth, but set an

00:11:50.475 --> 00:11:53.955
example for the believers in speech
conduct and love and faith and purity.

00:11:55.545 --> 00:11:58.815
He speaking directly to Paul and
Timothy, who was young, right?

00:11:58.815 --> 00:12:01.725
Many believed that they were
probably, he was in his thirties.

00:12:02.475 --> 00:12:06.765
So here's another question I want to ask
anybody ever led something where people

00:12:06.765 --> 00:12:07.905
really didn't trust you to lead it?

00:12:07.905 --> 00:12:09.025
Well, they began to question you.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:10.920
Begin to think you couldn't lead.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.640
Well, anybody ever tried to lead
something and just didn't go well, good.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:14.850
Okay.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:15.870
There's a couple of you, right?

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.550
So you're trying to lead.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.439
And many of those around
you didn't trust you.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.850
Question is how did you respond?

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.750
So how did you respond to if you've
led something and people didn't

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.950
trust you, how did you respond?

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:26.910
Did you step into the play?

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.580
Did you keep going or did you
give up anybody want to share?

00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.340
Okay.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.660
Well, here's what typically happens.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.170
We either give up.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.370
We either push through, right.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:45.280
Or we get angry, but here's what
Paul's saying, rather than trying to

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.680
defend yourself, get angry or give up.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.420
Here's what I'm going
to challenge you to do.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.960
Timothy, your greatest defense
Timothy is to prove it.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.700
Anybody ever played pig before
the game of pig basketball, why do

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.780
you have to do on the third shot?

00:12:58.810 --> 00:12:58.960
Now?

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.500
This is the way I play.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.460
What do you have to do on the third shot?

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.790
If you make the third shot, if
you basically, if you're going

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.140
to make them get a G, they miss.

00:13:10.245 --> 00:13:12.345
Oh, so I was going to say
my way I played differently.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.235
So this is where I
probably got to clarify.

00:13:14.235 --> 00:13:17.415
So typically how I would play is if
we're I just made a shot and they

00:13:17.415 --> 00:13:19.875
missed it, and that means they're
going to get G they say, prove it.

00:13:20.595 --> 00:13:23.805
So on that G I have to make it
again, which means I have to

00:13:23.805 --> 00:13:25.155
prove that I can hit that shot.

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:29.355
So my analogy totally went out the window
because all of us don't play pig the

00:13:29.355 --> 00:13:32.625
same, but this is how fun things happen.

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:37.125
So drawing back into what, what Paul is
challenging Timothy is to gain confidence

00:13:37.125 --> 00:13:41.325
and the people you're leading, prove it
with your character, with how you live.

00:13:41.505 --> 00:13:42.375
And here's the important part.

00:13:42.375 --> 00:13:43.095
I want to clarify this.

00:13:43.275 --> 00:13:46.635
Paul's not saying prove it to
God, God, our loves Timothy.

00:13:47.175 --> 00:13:49.665
God already trusts Timothy
with leadership, but the people

00:13:49.665 --> 00:13:53.115
around him don't trust him
yet because of his young age.

00:13:54.135 --> 00:13:57.135
So when we are living our lifestyle
for Christ, sometimes we have

00:13:57.135 --> 00:14:00.825
to prove our lives, meaning
our, our true belief in Christ.

00:14:01.005 --> 00:14:04.935
So here's what did Paul
challenge Timothy to prove?

00:14:04.935 --> 00:14:05.295
Right?

00:14:05.745 --> 00:14:08.625
He says this to set an example in speech.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.940
He says our words, basically,
we're talking about the speech.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.280
Our words should always
be loving and honest.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.950
Ephesians four 15 says speaking the truth
and love by being encouraging by speaking

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.900
the truth of God by being consistent.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.990
So in our speeches, it's
understanding that our, what

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.570
we say influences other people.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.020
So for Timothy, what he said in the
church was important, but I love

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.270
how he says speech and then conduct.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.240
They work together because what we say.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.920
It means nothing.

00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:41.010
Go back to the question as the
beginning, what we say means nothing,

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.750
unless we back it up with our conduct.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.199
Amen.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.370
Is that true?

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.819
Right.

00:14:44.819 --> 00:14:45.630
We can say anything all day.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.829
So he says by the conduct was, I mean,
walk the way you talk back up your

00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:54.449
speech live lives that are controlled
by the word of God and the truth of God.

00:14:55.335 --> 00:14:59.175
And Paul actually writes this
in first in Titus, one 16.

00:14:59.595 --> 00:15:03.885
He says they claim to know God,
but they deny him by their works.

00:15:04.065 --> 00:15:07.695
They are detestable disobedient
and unfit for any good work.

00:15:08.685 --> 00:15:12.135
So they weren't following up what
they said with what, how they lived.

00:15:12.465 --> 00:15:14.175
But then he says, okay, set an example.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:21.480
You know, what they, anybody ever like
led you or challenged you, but seemed like

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.110
you were just upon and their little scheme
of getting things accomplished anybody.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.570
Like you were just, they
didn't care about you.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.130
It just seemed like they
want you to get a task done.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.190
This is where speech is great.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.540
Now your conduct matches up.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.760
Meaning like you're walking
in, you're living out your

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.840
you're saying right things.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.150
You're doing the right things,
but you have no heart in it.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.800
You truly aren't sincere.

00:15:41.535 --> 00:15:42.824
When you're leading the people.

00:15:42.824 --> 00:15:44.505
So it's just this, this idea.

00:15:44.535 --> 00:15:48.074
When I think about, if, if Paul speaking
directly to me again, I'm a pastor

00:15:48.555 --> 00:15:52.725
it's like seriously challenging you
guys to grow in your faith and acting

00:15:52.725 --> 00:15:54.105
like, I don't care anything about you.

00:15:54.555 --> 00:15:57.225
Hey, you need to live this out
and I'm living it out, but I

00:15:57.225 --> 00:15:58.335
don't care anything about you.

00:15:59.355 --> 00:15:59.775
Right.

00:15:59.805 --> 00:16:01.455
That's where he's challenging.

00:16:01.455 --> 00:16:05.385
Timothy, be affectionate, be
charitable is another word, right.

00:16:05.385 --> 00:16:06.585
Showing them that you care.

00:16:07.064 --> 00:16:13.430
And then he says in faith, And faith is
actually trusting God with your life and

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.290
sharing how God is moving in your life.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.590
Right?

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.900
Faith means you believe
God for bigger things.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.160
So you're modeling it.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.870
And then you're sharing
testimonies when God.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.910
I got the opportunity to
share a great testimony.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.760
I hear with the parking crew, because
we've been praying for God to move

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:30.240
for us, to be able to get our house
and interest rates have been going up.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.620
And I'm like, how are
you going to do this God?

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.340
Well, this last week, I think there's
a good chance in the next two weeks

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.580
to a T how we can afford this thing.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.600
It's going to work out perfectly like
to the number and that's how we've

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.650
been playing for the last two years.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.030
I don't know how it's supposed to happen.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.260
But in the moment we were trusting
God, and then God's starting to

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.280
show up and guess what I'm doing?

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.000
I'm sharing testimony.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.930
God is faithful.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:52.980
God is good.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.290
And, and we, we forget sometimes to be
fate, have faith, and then to share that

00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.610
because those testimonies are powerful.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.840
And so modeling, taking steps of faith and
sharing those testaments are important.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.760
And mark Batterson heard this
quote the other day and it

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.050
just, it really challenged me.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.670
He said, fear is letting your
circumstances come between you

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:14.099
and God, but here's what faith is.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:18.030
Faith is letting God get between
you and your circumstances.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.960
Faith is letting God get between
you and your circumstances.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.980
It's understanding that God is in
control, not fear, not anything else.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.270
So he said model.

00:17:28.325 --> 00:17:29.195
Your faithfulness.

00:17:29.195 --> 00:17:30.754
And then the last one he
said, is that your purity?

00:17:30.754 --> 00:17:31.264
Right?

00:17:31.595 --> 00:17:33.004
He says, set an example in purity.

00:17:33.004 --> 00:17:33.575
What does this mean?

00:17:33.575 --> 00:17:36.395
Keeping ourselves pure
in mind, heart and body.

00:17:36.815 --> 00:17:37.715
It means avoiding sin.

00:17:37.725 --> 00:17:38.855
Does this mean we're going to be perfect?

00:17:38.855 --> 00:17:44.075
No, we know apart from Christ, we can't be
perfect, but as we pursue Christ, our life

00:17:44.075 --> 00:17:47.014
will be sin less or more, less sinful.

00:17:47.044 --> 00:17:47.915
That makes sense.

00:17:48.185 --> 00:17:51.455
And so we're modeling these things
so that we can set a good example.

00:17:51.455 --> 00:17:52.205
That's what he's challenging.

00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:54.215
Timothy and imperfection.

00:17:54.245 --> 00:17:54.514
No.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.170
But actually out of faithfulness
and out of love and out of

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.640
conduct in speech and purity.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.580
So he shares these things with
Timothy and he shares them with

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.560
us to help us set this example so
that when we are leading people.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.240
And so you're saying
again, who am I leading?

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.370
You may, um, be a mother at home.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.210
You're leading your kids.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.560
You may be in a company and you
may be the lowest on the totem

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.140
pole, but you're still a leader
because you're setting an example.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:20.940
You may be at the gas station.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.010
You may be at a dance competition.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.510
You may be at 48.

00:18:25.245 --> 00:18:26.235
I don't care where you are.

00:18:26.235 --> 00:18:29.475
You may be at school, but you're
setting an example for those around you.

00:18:29.804 --> 00:18:36.074
And if you'll pursue to live a life with
this conduct, not to gain please from God,

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:41.445
but to really show God to other people,
to show who Christ is to other people.

00:18:42.014 --> 00:18:45.645
This is what happens is when we begin
to live this way, the people that

00:18:45.645 --> 00:18:47.804
are struggling with their faith,
who Jesus is, and you may be in

00:18:47.804 --> 00:18:48.915
this room, you may be struggling.

00:18:49.064 --> 00:18:49.784
Who is Jesus?

00:18:49.784 --> 00:18:50.655
Why should I give my life to.

00:18:51.915 --> 00:18:54.915
I hope today, you'll see
this, that we are a church.

00:18:54.945 --> 00:18:57.855
We are a group of people that shines
the light of Christ to other people

00:18:57.855 --> 00:19:03.825
that we love, that we care that we, we
are, obviously we back up what we say.

00:19:03.825 --> 00:19:06.825
If we truly say we care for you, we
actually follow up and care for you.

00:19:06.825 --> 00:19:07.275
Right?

00:19:07.575 --> 00:19:09.195
We want to be that church.

00:19:10.245 --> 00:19:14.025
And so, because we've experienced
Jesus, his saving grace, we pursue

00:19:14.055 --> 00:19:17.415
godliness because it benefits
us of God's promises today.

00:19:17.415 --> 00:19:19.095
And he said this last week, and to the.

00:19:20.445 --> 00:19:23.325
But also in the pursuit of becoming
more like Christ, we set the example

00:19:23.325 --> 00:19:27.495
for others who may be skeptical young
in their faith so that they will one day

00:19:27.495 --> 00:19:29.145
accept Christ or grow in their faith.

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.355
So that is where Paul starts off.

00:19:32.355 --> 00:19:32.655
Right.

00:19:32.655 --> 00:19:36.345
Challenging Timothy to set this example,
but now he's going to transition.

00:19:37.125 --> 00:19:38.835
He says, okay, that's your role?

00:19:38.835 --> 00:19:40.815
Timothy now shared these
things with the church.

00:19:41.805 --> 00:19:42.615
These things with the church.

00:19:42.645 --> 00:19:44.445
What should you do together as the church?

00:19:44.475 --> 00:19:49.545
What should you prioritize as the church
to help other people pursue godliness?

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:52.665
Again, godliness is just
being more like Christ.

00:19:52.665 --> 00:19:56.025
Why is it beneficial to be more like
Christ because Christ changed the world

00:19:57.165 --> 00:20:01.245
and Christ influenced people by showing
grace and mercy and giving us a hope.

00:20:01.545 --> 00:20:03.015
And if we can model that to other.

00:20:03.825 --> 00:20:04.905
Man, we can change the world.

00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:06.585
So how can we help other
people pursue godliness?

00:20:06.735 --> 00:20:10.274
Here's what he says in verse 13, he
says, until I come and this is Paul

00:20:10.274 --> 00:20:14.925
saying, until I come see you church,
he says, give your attention to public

00:20:14.925 --> 00:20:17.504
reading expectations and teaching.

00:20:18.075 --> 00:20:19.155
So prioritize the word.

00:20:19.935 --> 00:20:21.195
Now that sounds simple, right?

00:20:21.195 --> 00:20:23.355
I mean, I don't know many churches that.

00:20:24.405 --> 00:20:27.345
Preach the word on Sunday mornings,
but I think there's more to this.

00:20:27.345 --> 00:20:30.945
He says the public reading and
Isaiah 55, 10 through 11 says

00:20:30.945 --> 00:20:32.595
this, and I think it's important.

00:20:32.595 --> 00:20:32.955
We hear this.

00:20:32.955 --> 00:20:33.495
He says this.

00:20:33.495 --> 00:20:38.895
He says for just as the rain and the
snow fall from heaven and do not return

00:20:38.895 --> 00:20:42.615
there without saturating the earth
and making it germinate and sprout and

00:20:42.615 --> 00:20:44.685
providing seed to sow and food to eat.

00:20:44.955 --> 00:20:49.635
So my word that comes from my
mouth will not return empty, but

00:20:49.635 --> 00:20:52.455
it will accomplish what I please
and prosper and what I send it.

00:20:53.865 --> 00:20:58.004
So by the public reading of the
word, God is speaking to us.

00:20:58.125 --> 00:20:59.085
And here's what he promises.

00:20:59.085 --> 00:21:03.254
I love when God's word is clear, he
promises that word will not return void.

00:21:04.095 --> 00:21:06.105
So when we come in as a group,
we're going to prioritize the

00:21:06.105 --> 00:21:07.575
word, but here's the thing.

00:21:07.754 --> 00:21:09.254
Don't starve yourself.

00:21:09.315 --> 00:21:11.055
Last week, we talked
about the word nourished.

00:21:11.955 --> 00:21:14.655
Don't starve yourself by waiting
every Sunday to have a mil.

00:21:15.014 --> 00:21:15.735
Does that make sense?

00:21:15.764 --> 00:21:16.695
Cause I'll know this.

00:21:17.115 --> 00:21:20.774
If we're talking about real food,
I won't wait four hours before.

00:21:21.629 --> 00:21:25.980
But sometimes the word we'll
wait a week to have it right.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.180
I mean, you guys know this.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.510
You're probably a lot like me at
times we get busy and we don't see

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.629
that the word has beneficial, but God
clearly says the word has beneficial.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:38.639
So I encourage you in this
feed on the word daily, right.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.290
So that God can teach you.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.240
He can grow you in.

00:21:44.215 --> 00:21:48.475
And so worn where's B said this, he says
a person who is not growing is actually

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:51.535
going backwards for it is impossible
to stand still in the Christian life.

00:21:51.805 --> 00:21:54.175
The word of God grows us in our faith.

00:21:54.175 --> 00:21:57.475
So Paul says to Timothy
prioritize that in the church.

00:21:57.475 --> 00:22:00.385
And he says, not only the public
reading, but he says also exercise.

00:22:01.185 --> 00:22:01.905
And teaching.

00:22:02.445 --> 00:22:03.435
And so that's what we're doing today.

00:22:03.435 --> 00:22:05.595
Expectation is the
encouragement in the word.

00:22:05.985 --> 00:22:08.535
It's understanding the word better, right?

00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:10.665
Just not the reading of it,
but understanding it and then

00:22:10.665 --> 00:22:11.985
applying it to our lives.

00:22:12.325 --> 00:22:13.365
So that's what we're doing today.

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:17.175
And we do that not only on Sundays, we
do that on our Wednesday night inspire

00:22:17.175 --> 00:22:19.815
groups when we meet on Wednesday nights
and here's this to invite to you.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.420
If you're not an, an inspire group,
I'd love for you to be in part of one.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.980
We have two that go on one in Middletown,
one here, usually here at pathway or

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.870
at our home in Fayetteville township.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.100
We're actually doing a fellowship
this Wednesday, a food Hangouts.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.680
If you want to come be a part of
that, catch me after we'd love

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.520
for you to be a part of that.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.460
But he talks about that.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.889
We should X, X, X rotate,
and teach as well.

00:22:42.889 --> 00:22:46.550
Not only just reading and for us to be
able to do this for me, to be able to

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.200
teach for us, to be able to teach others.

00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:50.715
We have to be fed first.

00:22:51.285 --> 00:22:54.465
So we have to grow in the word
before we can give back to others.

00:22:56.095 --> 00:22:57.264
So he says this.

00:22:57.264 --> 00:23:00.355
If we want to help people pursue
godliness, we need to prioritize the

00:23:00.355 --> 00:23:01.855
word in our lives and in the church.

00:23:02.065 --> 00:23:06.115
But then he moves on to verses 14
and 15, and he says, Timothy, don't

00:23:06.115 --> 00:23:07.495
neglect the gift that is in you.

00:23:07.945 --> 00:23:11.155
If you have given, it was given to
you through the prophecy and with the

00:23:11.155 --> 00:23:14.605
laying on of hands by the council of
the elders, practice, these things

00:23:14.605 --> 00:23:17.905
be committed to them so that your
progress may be evident to all.

00:23:18.325 --> 00:23:18.625
So.

00:23:19.275 --> 00:23:21.525
Paul says to Timothy,
don't neglect your gift.

00:23:21.585 --> 00:23:26.055
Now he's not talking about like a gift
we get at our birthdays is this, I got

00:23:26.055 --> 00:23:29.505
this gift at my birthday, so I didn't
neglect putting that gift on, but this

00:23:29.505 --> 00:23:31.035
one's really no value spiritually.

00:23:31.515 --> 00:23:33.915
He's talking about the gift
that God gives us as a believer.

00:23:34.425 --> 00:23:37.515
So if you've given your life to
Christ, God has given you a gift.

00:23:37.515 --> 00:23:38.175
Now here's the thing.

00:23:38.175 --> 00:23:39.915
If you don't know what that
gift is, don't a feature.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.830
Because many times we
have to grow to know it.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:48.000
We have to study God's word and we have
to begin to seek out and begin to test

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.280
what is it that God has gifted me in.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:54.240
But he's telling Timothy specifically
here don't neglect your gifts, which

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.650
Timothy would know what it was.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:24:00.810
His gift was to teach his gift was
also to pastor and to shepherd.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.990
And what we're thinking, because
if you know much about Timothy

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.980
and if you don't that's okay.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.570
Timothy is known to be.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:10.199
He tend to not be as bold in his faith.

00:24:10.229 --> 00:24:12.810
And so what Paul was doing, and
he'll even do this in, I think

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.129
it's second Timothy as well.

00:24:14.429 --> 00:24:17.399
He'll tell Timothy and second
Timothy fan into flame.

00:24:17.399 --> 00:24:19.709
The gift that God has given you,
because Timothy was struggling to

00:24:19.709 --> 00:24:24.810
use his gifts because sometimes using
our gifts makes us uncomfortable, but

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:28.169
uncomfortable, not like in a bad way,
but uncomfortable because we feel like

00:24:28.169 --> 00:24:30.360
if we use our gifts, we're going to fell.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.590
But what we realized is that God is the
one that empowers us to use that gift.

00:24:34.709 --> 00:24:35.310
What are the gifts?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.620
Do you guys know what,
let me ask this question.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.410
What is the purpose of the
gifts that God gives us?

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.580
What does the purpose of the gifts?

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.060
Anybody?

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:49.350
What's the benefit of the gift that
we get to glorify God, what else?

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.080
To spread his word and
to benefit one another.

00:24:57.315 --> 00:25:00.645
When we get gifts from God, there they're
meant to benefit the body of Christ.

00:25:00.645 --> 00:25:03.255
And so these gifts, and here's the
thing I could list them out all day.

00:25:03.255 --> 00:25:06.675
You'll hear things, the gift of prophecy,
the gift of teaching, the gift of

00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:08.535
administration, the gift of serving.

00:25:08.535 --> 00:25:09.585
And there's more and more and more.

00:25:09.585 --> 00:25:11.295
And so if you want to know
more about that, cause I don't

00:25:11.295 --> 00:25:12.495
have time to unpack all of it.

00:25:12.885 --> 00:25:16.365
These things are found in first
Corinthians 12, Romans 12.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.850
And Ephesians four.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:21.750
And I'll say that again, first Corinthians
12, Romans 12 and Ephesians four.

00:25:22.139 --> 00:25:23.879
And you can begin to study on that.

00:25:23.879 --> 00:25:26.940
And then we've actually been talking
as a church that we may go through

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.960
these messages to talk more about
how we use the gift of God that's

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.680
inside of us so that each one of
us can know what our gifts are.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.490
Um, but I still challenge you
not to just wait, because again,

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.280
Paul's telling Timothy your
gift is valuable to the church.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.540
Don't neglect it.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:43.680
Well, here's the thing.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.159
If we're in this.

00:25:45.355 --> 00:25:49.455
If you've given your life to Christ,
your gift is valuable to one of us in

00:25:49.455 --> 00:25:53.085
this room and to the church that, you
know, outside of this church, right.

00:25:53.865 --> 00:25:56.085
That gift needs to be
used for them as well.

00:25:56.295 --> 00:25:58.514
And so for you discovering
it is so important.

00:25:58.965 --> 00:26:02.355
So what can you do if you don't
fully know what your gift is, I'm

00:26:02.355 --> 00:26:03.465
going to give you three things.

00:26:04.085 --> 00:26:05.595
Number one is to pray.

00:26:05.595 --> 00:26:07.485
And that sounds so like cliche.

00:26:07.514 --> 00:26:08.325
Pastor's going to tell you.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.510
Seriously, prayer is just talking to God.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.220
Here's what we do in prayer.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.159
Ask God to make you aware, but
God, what is it that you given me

00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:19.830
a passion and desire a gifting?

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:20.790
What is it that you given me?

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:22.379
Lord reveal that to me.

00:26:22.379 --> 00:26:22.620
Right?

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.200
And as you seek his
word, I believe he will.

00:26:25.379 --> 00:26:28.889
Number two, learn by getting involved.

00:26:29.879 --> 00:26:32.490
I'll tell you I was very great at this.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.740
Whenever I gave my life to
Christ, I was this guy asking a

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.270
lot of questions about my faith.

00:26:37.065 --> 00:26:40.215
And you know what God kept telling me,
not audibly, but as I studied his word

00:26:40.215 --> 00:26:42.345
through prayer, he said, get involved.

00:26:43.925 --> 00:26:45.305
Trust me just do this.

00:26:45.305 --> 00:26:48.605
And so every step of my faith was
I got involved in student ministry.

00:26:48.905 --> 00:26:51.905
I didn't like teenagers, but I was
gonna try it while I got in there

00:26:51.905 --> 00:26:54.185
and actually realized, Hey, it was
pretty cool hanging around teenagers.

00:26:54.455 --> 00:26:57.155
And then I grew in my faith because I got
opportunities to lead different things.

00:26:57.305 --> 00:26:59.495
The first thing that led us, a
student student, like helping

00:26:59.495 --> 00:27:00.995
a student leader was games at.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:02.960
I didn't know what I was doing.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:06.470
I just led some kind of crazy games and
gut God done and was like, what is that?

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:07.790
Well, that grew my faith.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.070
So then I started leading
small groups in there.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.630
Then I started leading
small groups for adults.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.840
And then I started teaching on Wednesday
nights and then I started and it

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.620
just moved and moved to new because
I kept saying yes to the opportunity.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.430
Now here's the thing.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.170
Sometimes you're gonna say
yes to something and be

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.520
like, this is not my gift.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:23.840
And that's okay.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.080
But now, you know, one thing that
is not your gift, but if you sit on

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.280
the sidelines, Just reveal it to me.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.520
So I know and go, God's going to say,
trust me, just take a step of faith.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.240
So get involved, not only in the
church, I'll encourage you in that, but

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.950
also get involved in your community.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:41.370
Get involved in your neighborhood,
get involved at your work,

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:43.409
start trying different things.

00:27:43.409 --> 00:27:44.820
And the Lord will reveal you.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.200
And I'll just challenge you in this.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.200
Don't just try, what's
comfortable challenge yourself

00:27:49.379 --> 00:27:51.360
because God empowers the gift.

00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.840
Not you.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:52.500
God does.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:53.639
Here's the last one?

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:54.990
Get feedback.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.970
I love this there's times.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.040
I'll ask Brittany, like,
am I good at anything?

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.690
Like, am I doing anything worth valuable?

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.760
And she'll, she'll start building
me up because here's what she does.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.180
My wife.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:06.720
She says, Hey, here's
some things that made.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.140
You're just, God has gifted you in
because I am not good at evaluating

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.060
myself with those around me are.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.850
So ask a friend, ask your pastor.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:18.610
You're going to ask me, I'd love
to tell you, um, ask your spouse.

00:28:19.395 --> 00:28:22.605
What is it maybe that you see
in me that God could use me for.

00:28:22.755 --> 00:28:26.715
And then as they begin to explain that,
begin to lean into it and try it right?

00:28:26.715 --> 00:28:27.165
Try it.

00:28:27.615 --> 00:28:30.105
Why do we do this for
the benefit of the body?

00:28:30.105 --> 00:28:31.905
Because there is someone waiting on you.

00:28:32.295 --> 00:28:33.795
There's someone don't miss this.

00:28:33.795 --> 00:28:36.225
There's someone waiting on
you to fulfill your gift.

00:28:36.555 --> 00:28:37.635
Someone was waiting on Timothy.

00:28:37.635 --> 00:28:39.135
That's why Paul was writing Timothy.

00:28:39.375 --> 00:28:40.275
Don't neglect your.

00:28:41.429 --> 00:28:42.300
So here's the last one.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.470
And I think this is a tool.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:44.970
It's a spiritual gift test.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.240
Many people have created these spiritual
gift tests for you to go out and take.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.490
And again, so, you know, this is for
believers and cause if you're not a

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.639
believer, you'll be really looking
from a worldly standpoint at this, but

00:28:53.639 --> 00:28:54.689
it's going to ask a ton of questions.

00:28:54.689 --> 00:28:56.610
Then it's going to spit out some
results of here's some areas

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.439
where you're strong in gifting.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.480
If you have questions
about that with like that.

00:29:01.135 --> 00:29:02.695
Let me know I can send that to you.

00:29:02.725 --> 00:29:03.475
It's free.

00:29:03.685 --> 00:29:04.945
Um, it's pretty cool how it works.

00:29:04.945 --> 00:29:07.524
I took it last night just to kind
of see where mine are and mine

00:29:07.534 --> 00:29:10.074
pegged, like everything that I'm
doing right now, which is cool.

00:29:10.375 --> 00:29:13.764
Um, but it would be something good
for you to, to take and guide you

00:29:13.764 --> 00:29:15.564
as you're seeking the Lord in this.

00:29:15.564 --> 00:29:15.925
Right.

00:29:16.104 --> 00:29:18.145
So again, why is it important
to discover your gift?

00:29:18.145 --> 00:29:22.435
Because there is someone waiting
on you to, to find that gift,

00:29:22.645 --> 00:29:25.915
to begin, to live it out, to
influence others, to know Christ.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.330
So when we make spiritual progress, it
helps others make spiritual progress.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.390
I know this when I was growing in my
faith and somebody else has grown in their

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:36.510
faith, it encouraged me to know more.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.670
So we're supposed to spur one another on.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.990
It's really cool how that works.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:44.070
And so Paul says in verse 15,
practice these things, what things,

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:49.590
reading the word, exhorting,
teaching, using your gifts.

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:53.820
He says, because if you practice
these things, they'll become

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:54.750
evident to other people.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:55.440
So let's backtrack.

00:29:56.505 --> 00:29:59.565
We build trust with people because
he was young in his faith, Timothy,

00:29:59.835 --> 00:30:03.285
he built trust by using his gifts.

00:30:03.435 --> 00:30:09.375
He built trust by setting the
example, this isn't trusting God,

00:30:09.375 --> 00:30:11.925
like God's not looking and saying,
man, you're showing yourself faithful.

00:30:12.105 --> 00:30:18.555
It's the people around you who say,
Hey, you claim to be a Christian, but

00:30:18.555 --> 00:30:22.185
you're different because I hear people
talk about going to church on Sunday.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:24.540
But you do more than that.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.500
Like you live it out.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.760
Like you truly care for me.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.070
You, you truly want to pray for me.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:30.690
You, you truly want me to know who God is.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.060
You want to be generous to me.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:40.920
What, like when you begin to now practice
these things, it now begins to influence

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.560
those around you to go, you know what?

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.450
I believe the God that you serve Israel.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.590
I've heard other people say
something, but you're living it.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:55.695
So when we use our gifts, When we
model what it is to know Christ,

00:30:56.264 --> 00:30:58.425
we begin to change those around us.

00:30:58.785 --> 00:31:00.705
Are I just give you an
encouragement with this?

00:31:00.705 --> 00:31:01.305
We'll move on.

00:31:01.905 --> 00:31:03.435
I remember preaching my first sermon.

00:31:03.435 --> 00:31:05.235
I preached the two weeks
after a certain ministry.

00:31:05.415 --> 00:31:06.825
I didn't know what I was surrendering to.

00:31:06.825 --> 00:31:09.225
I knew I was turning into ministry, but I
didn't know it was the preach, but they.

00:31:10.185 --> 00:31:11.025
Preach in two weeks.

00:31:11.025 --> 00:31:13.155
And I didn't like public
speaking, but I did anyways,

00:31:13.155 --> 00:31:14.265
because I wanna try something.

00:31:14.265 --> 00:31:14.595
Right.

00:31:15.015 --> 00:31:18.945
I remember preaching that message and
man, so many people after service man.

00:31:18.975 --> 00:31:19.635
Great message.

00:31:19.635 --> 00:31:20.235
As awesome.

00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:21.015
Cool.

00:31:21.225 --> 00:31:21.885
Okay, great.

00:31:22.725 --> 00:31:25.095
The, one of the last messages I
preached before I left my church in

00:31:25.095 --> 00:31:28.545
Oklahoma, I remember somebody coming
up to me and they said, man, you

00:31:28.545 --> 00:31:30.315
have really grown in your teaching.

00:31:30.315 --> 00:31:31.755
You are so much better.

00:31:31.995 --> 00:31:34.815
And I went, wait, whoa, you
said I was good back then.

00:31:34.935 --> 00:31:37.515
What, what it was is what
they were saying is I saw.

00:31:38.325 --> 00:31:39.645
You mature in your faith.

00:31:39.675 --> 00:31:43.995
I saw you not only start, start
there, but you grew, you begin

00:31:43.995 --> 00:31:47.355
to train and pursue and grow.

00:31:47.475 --> 00:31:51.225
And I see it's evident and they
were really boasting in me.

00:31:51.225 --> 00:31:54.254
They were really, most of them were
boasting and what God did in me,

00:31:54.585 --> 00:31:59.445
because I leaned into my gifts,
which my gifts are not based upon me

00:31:59.475 --> 00:32:02.385
producing it based upon God producing.

00:32:02.385 --> 00:32:03.135
That's the cool part guys.

00:32:03.135 --> 00:32:05.655
When we lean into our gifts,
God has to do the work.

00:32:06.345 --> 00:32:06.825
We don't have.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:12.300
And it doesn't mean we don't train,
but we pursue God and God trains us up.

00:32:12.689 --> 00:32:17.669
So I say that is, it becomes evident
not to boast in yourself, but to

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:20.370
really magnify Christ to other people.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.350
So by pursuing our gifts that God
has given us, we will discover more

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.820
and more of what God has for us.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.659
This side of heaven.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.600
And your commitment will encourage
others to discover their own.

00:32:32.295 --> 00:32:36.405
I mean, I think isn't that why we're here
as a church to inspire hope by helping

00:32:36.405 --> 00:32:39.915
people discover God's purpose for their
life through relationship with Jesus.

00:32:40.215 --> 00:32:41.535
That is why we are here.

00:32:41.985 --> 00:32:45.645
So last thing here that Paul
is teaching Timothy in us.

00:32:46.065 --> 00:32:49.575
As we can help people pursue godliness,
not only by preaching and prioritizing

00:32:49.575 --> 00:32:53.145
the word in our lives and in the church
or by using our gifts, but also by

00:32:53.145 --> 00:32:57.705
examining our lives by raise of hands.

00:32:57.705 --> 00:32:59.505
How many y'all feel like you
don't have enough time in the

00:32:59.505 --> 00:33:00.465
day to get everything done?

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.260
So who has time to examine?

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:09.900
Cause examining causes you to stop
everything you're doing and look at

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.950
what you are doing and say, is this
the most valuable thing that I'm doing?

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.340
We are very task driven people.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.860
And so, you know, I relate with you.

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:21.270
I get it.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:27.580
But when we know something is so
valuable, we start prioritizing.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.510
To the hire list, hire
part of a list, right?

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:31.379
You all have that list.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.770
So rather than making it the 12th
thing and you only get done with six,

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:37.230
make it the number one thing he says
to examine ourselves, this is what

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:42.090
he says, pay close attention to your
life and your teaching persevere,

00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:46.199
these things for in doing so we'll say
both you and yourself and your hears.

00:33:47.639 --> 00:33:49.740
If you know, you can save
someone's eternal life.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.680
If, you know, you can
save your eternal life.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.500
And what I mean by that is by knowing
God more, it's going to build you up.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:00.090
If you know that like, don't, you
want to prioritize that as one of the

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:01.650
most important things in your life.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.980
So what's the value in examining right?

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.860
Examining our lives allows us to look.

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:13.529
Allows us to, to see where we've
been going and to think, are we

00:34:13.529 --> 00:34:18.000
truly portraying a life that honors
Christ are we truly prioritizing

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.319
the things that God has called us
to, are we truly using our gifts to

00:34:22.319 --> 00:34:24.989
glorify God or only benefit ourselves?

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.980
So.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.960
How do we examine ourselves?

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.060
Here's a couple of things for
you to take home, as you think

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.290
about how to examine yourself.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.080
Number one is that you
can examine yourself.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:35.310
I've got my one papers confused here.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.010
You can examine yourself by
taking a spiritual inventory

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:38.730
that is worth these things.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:41.070
As this is a personal thing
that I would just give you.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:44.370
Number one, examine is my life.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.929
What is my life reflecting?

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:47.639
So again, write that out.

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.570
Like, what is my life perfecting?

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:52.050
If you're a believer, is my life
reflecting Christ or does it reflect

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.820
that everything else in my life has.

00:34:54.885 --> 00:34:55.155
Right.

00:34:55.155 --> 00:34:56.445
So here, what do you wonder?

00:34:56.475 --> 00:34:57.825
Look at your calendar.

00:34:58.935 --> 00:35:01.005
Look at your bank account, right?

00:35:01.215 --> 00:35:03.675
Look at what you do every day.

00:35:03.705 --> 00:35:04.065
David.

00:35:04.065 --> 00:35:05.325
It's an honor kind of look
at what you do every day.

00:35:05.325 --> 00:35:05.895
Write it all out.

00:35:05.925 --> 00:35:07.275
Is this honoring God?

00:35:07.275 --> 00:35:08.025
Now here's the other thing.

00:35:08.025 --> 00:35:09.225
This is going to be vulnerable.

00:35:09.945 --> 00:35:13.605
Invite somebody in and
ask them, what is my wife?

00:35:13.605 --> 00:35:13.995
Reflecting?

00:35:13.995 --> 00:35:15.045
Just, just ask the question.

00:35:15.075 --> 00:35:16.125
What is my life reflecting?

00:35:17.025 --> 00:35:19.065
And if they're not saying it's
reflecting Christ, but they're saying,

00:35:19.065 --> 00:35:20.865
Hey, it's reflecting a good person.

00:35:22.065 --> 00:35:23.145
It's reflecting.

00:35:23.415 --> 00:35:25.455
You're, you're great at
whatever you do at your job.

00:35:25.694 --> 00:35:29.355
Maybe we need to think, oh
man, I'm not reflecting Christ.

00:35:29.355 --> 00:35:33.795
So we evaluate, we examine number
one, examine the truth you are

00:35:33.795 --> 00:35:35.745
living and telling others about God.

00:35:35.955 --> 00:35:38.085
Here's the question is what
you're telling other people

00:35:38.085 --> 00:35:39.915
aligning with God or the world.

00:35:40.125 --> 00:35:43.274
Are you telling people to just be better
people or are you telling people to

00:35:43.274 --> 00:35:46.484
know Christ to become more Christ-like
which makes them a better person?

00:35:47.384 --> 00:35:48.765
Like what are we telling people?

00:35:48.765 --> 00:35:50.295
Evaluate that against God's word.

00:35:51.075 --> 00:35:54.375
Examine, whether you have discovered
your gift and are using it for the

00:35:54.375 --> 00:35:57.285
benefit of other believers, because if
you haven't, then you're examining that.

00:35:57.285 --> 00:36:00.345
I need to discover that if you
have discovered it, am I not using

00:36:00.345 --> 00:36:04.455
it like Timothy wasn't and the
last thing he says here, those are

00:36:04.455 --> 00:36:05.384
so that's the way to examine it.

00:36:05.384 --> 00:36:09.765
The last thing he says is to
persevere in these things.

00:36:10.125 --> 00:36:14.205
So to persevere means to be
consistent, keep going, don't give up.

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.860
So finish well, right?

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.050
Pulse is the persevere in
these things and examining

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.060
ourselves and making adjustments.

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:22.320
Here's the challenge.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.870
I think I could be wrong with this.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.850
I think many of us take some time to
examine ourselves and we examine ourselves

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:34.980
and we find out we don't like where we
are and maybe not every area of our lives,

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:35.970
but there's some areas of our lives.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.920
We truly don't like where we are.

00:36:39.669 --> 00:36:41.020
So we feel convicted about it.

00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:42.339
We want to make a change.

00:36:42.549 --> 00:36:46.870
We even know some of the changes we
need to make, but we never set a date.

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.450
And we never asked somebody to
invite somebody into hold us

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:50.680
accountable to take that next step.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.149
So what do we do?

00:36:52.149 --> 00:36:52.810
We ignore it.

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.919
We don't make changes.

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:55.180
We move forward.

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:56.500
We get frustrated again.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.730
We examine our life.

00:36:57.759 --> 00:37:00.250
We realize where we messed up
and we need to make changes.

00:37:00.279 --> 00:37:02.980
We know what changes we need to
make, but we don't ever set a date.

00:37:04.029 --> 00:37:06.790
We don't ever invite somebody in to help
us take that next step and all account.

00:37:07.815 --> 00:37:14.654
Here's what Paul's saying, examine and
apply, examine, and apply whatever God is

00:37:14.654 --> 00:37:16.935
revealing to you as you examine your life.

00:37:16.964 --> 00:37:21.525
Why, why is it important for us to
examine ourselves and make adjustments?

00:37:22.575 --> 00:37:25.095
Because the mission is more important.

00:37:25.214 --> 00:37:30.345
He says this, if we do this, we'll say
both ourselves and our hears, we are not

00:37:30.345 --> 00:37:35.145
here as followers of Christ to just exist.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:40.710
We are here to know God and to
continue to grow towards him.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:44.400
And sometimes that's a Rocky path,
even for a pastor I'm with you.

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:45.120
I get it.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.930
But in that Rocky path, we're considering
continually examine ourselves.

00:37:50.024 --> 00:37:54.524
And we're adding, adding and taking away
things that are not valuable, right?

00:37:54.524 --> 00:37:55.805
We're adding things that are valuable.

00:37:55.845 --> 00:37:58.154
We're taking away things that are not
valuable so that we can know Christ more

00:37:58.154 --> 00:38:02.084
than we can reflect him, but it's also
the ability to influence other people.

00:38:02.535 --> 00:38:05.805
And so to be saved and help
other, be others be saved.

00:38:06.015 --> 00:38:09.345
We know that we have not only
accepted the mercy and grace of Jesus

00:38:09.345 --> 00:38:11.654
every day by using our gifts right.

00:38:11.654 --> 00:38:14.444
And applying these things, but
we can help other people discover

00:38:14.444 --> 00:38:15.495
their purpose through relationships.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.410
I don't know what you
need to be motivated.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:24.390
Paul, if you study any of his
letters, Paul was motivated

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:25.590
by the people he was serving.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:29.820
He was willing to sacrifice everything,
to serve the people around him, because he

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.460
knew that he had already accepted Christ.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.610
He knew where his Aternity
stood in the future and what

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:37.230
his life entailed that day.

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:40.440
His biggest concern until
the day of his last.

00:38:41.595 --> 00:38:45.435
Was who else needs to
know the truth of Jesus?

00:38:45.885 --> 00:38:49.785
So whether you like it or not, as
we kind of close today every day

00:38:50.445 --> 00:38:54.195
that God gives you to live, you are
setting an example for those around

00:38:54.195 --> 00:38:55.935
you, positively or negatively.

00:38:57.435 --> 00:39:02.565
Again, we're leaders in our home
we're leaders around our spouse or

00:39:02.775 --> 00:39:04.455
our coworkers or other believers.

00:39:04.605 --> 00:39:08.385
You are, you can't walk out of here,
not knowing that you are a leader.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.990
And so as Paul speaking to Timothy,
he speaking directly to us.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.520
So we need to answer this one question.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.160
What example am I setting
to those around me?

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.460
That's the challenge today, as we go
into invitation invitations, always an

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.980
opportunity to consider where we are.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:23.880
Here's the cool part.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:28.080
The last thing that Paul challenges
to do is to consider or reflect

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:30.810
right about where our lives are.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:33.210
So what example are we setting around us?

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.339
So as we think through that,
I'm going to give you guys some

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:36.779
questions to pose to yourself.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:44.000
Am I setting an example in speech,
in conduct, in love, in faith and

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.060
impurity, that models after Christ.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:52.250
If you're not, here's the great thing
God's not sitting here and this mean,

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.009
God, that's just so disappointed.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.250
You, you know what God's saying?

00:39:55.759 --> 00:40:00.380
Hey, you know, now, now you know,
you're not, or maybe you are, and you're

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.800
praising God for it, but if you're not,
you know what God says, Hey, come on.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:10.260
Just open your heart and say, Lord,
I need help to be better in my speech

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:15.150
to match that with my conduct, to be
better in love and to show my faith and

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:18.780
to be better impurity, not because that
justifies you to the Lord because your

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:23.940
justifications in Jesus Christ alone,
but so that you can know God more and so

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.380
that you can help other people no gun.

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:26.010
Right.

00:40:27.235 --> 00:40:29.035
So here's the other one, right?

00:40:29.035 --> 00:40:33.055
You can ask this, do I truly
desire to help myself and

00:40:33.055 --> 00:40:34.555
others make spiritual progress?

00:40:35.185 --> 00:40:38.185
Do I truly desire to help myself
and others make spiritual progress?

00:40:38.725 --> 00:40:40.975
If you were one of the people last
week, or maybe even today in your

00:40:40.975 --> 00:40:44.485
heart, you said, I want to help
other people make spiritual progress.

00:40:44.485 --> 00:40:49.825
If that was you truthfully
saying that what in your life is

00:40:49.825 --> 00:40:52.165
modeling that and reflecting that.

00:40:52.585 --> 00:40:54.145
So if you don't know,
if you feel like you're.

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:58.650
Seek the Lord ask the Lord,
what is it is the next step?

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.460
Invite somebody into that, tell
them I need help taking my next

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:06.390
step and what it means to help other
people know Chrysler to even myself.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.690
Right?

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.100
Here's here's another one.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.460
How have I discovered my gifts
or gifts that God has given me?

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:12.870
And am I using it for the benefit of.

00:41:14.759 --> 00:41:18.330
If you're not, and you haven't discovered
it, you can take a next step, ask the

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:20.580
Lord, help me know what that next step is.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.360
Here's the last question that maybe
many of you in this room need to ask?

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:25.049
I don't know.

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:26.460
And you only know this, you and the Lord.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:27.990
Maybe you need to ask the Lord.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:31.020
Do I truly know you have, I
truly surrender my life to you.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.190
Have I given my life to you?

00:41:32.759 --> 00:41:35.610
Do I even know what it means to
be saved and to give my life to

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:37.500
Jesus and to follow after him?

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.750
And if that's you today
and you don't know.

00:41:41.445 --> 00:41:43.785
God, doesn't put all these stipulations
that you meet, all these things.

00:41:44.085 --> 00:41:44.955
Here's what he's saying.

00:41:45.135 --> 00:41:49.035
Come to me, all you who are weary and
burdened and I will give you rest.

00:41:50.055 --> 00:41:54.765
Jesus is here every day to
receive a relationship with you.

00:41:55.905 --> 00:41:58.305
That's the number one thing I don't want
you to miss today because you can walk

00:41:58.305 --> 00:42:01.815
out of here feeling burdened by web thing
I share today, today is not a burden.

00:42:01.815 --> 00:42:04.305
It's an opportunity I'm telling you.

00:42:04.305 --> 00:42:08.745
It's an opportunity to be used by God,
but to be used by God, you got it.

00:42:09.629 --> 00:42:11.370
So today you haven't
given your life to Christ.

00:42:11.669 --> 00:42:13.649
Today's the day, today's the day.

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:19.919
How do you do that by recognizing your
need turning from your sins, which means

00:42:19.919 --> 00:42:24.899
this a life that is not God's best and
accepting what God has given us, grace

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.580
and mercy and forgiveness and opportunity
to be a part of a bigger picture to

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.560
change the world one person at a time.

00:42:32.189 --> 00:42:33.180
So if you have questions about.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:34.950
I'm always here.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:36.870
I'm going to be in the
bacteria invitation.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:39.270
You can come talk to me if that's
not comfortable to you, I'm going

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:40.259
to be at the next steps table.

00:42:40.259 --> 00:42:41.730
Come over and to say,
Hey, I have questions.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.580
I don't want this to be awkward.

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:46.770
I want this to be an opportunity
for you to know Jesus.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.990
So please come talk to me.

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.490
If you need prayer, come talk to me.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.549
But whatever you do during this
time of invitation, I challenge

00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:54.330
you to take a next step.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.230
Every believer is called
to a greater task.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.430
Again, not to justify themselves before
the Lord, but to honor the Lord and to

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:06.870
show your commitment to his desire for
everyone to come to know him and be saved.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:11.280
Let's examine ourselves during
this time of invitation and

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.560
move how God calls us to move.

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:14.190
Amen.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.560
Let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.110
We thank you Lord for today.

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:20.850
We thank you for your word.

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:21.900
We thank you for worship.

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:24.750
We thank you for just the
opportunity Lord, for each

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:25.740
one of us to be in this room.

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:29.430
Lord, we don't take it for granted
because Lord there's, there's a lot

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:33.390
of people not in this room and it's
not because we're sitting here saying,

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.830
oh man, Lord, we're judging them.

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:35.070
Really?

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:38.970
We're just saying we're here because Lord
you've aligned everything to be here.

00:43:40.529 --> 00:43:44.129
Every one of us, there could have been
something else that we chose to do.

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:48.660
But today, Lord, you chose to open the
door, maybe through a simple invite

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:52.500
to open the door, to not push news on
the alarm clock Lord, but you drew us

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:56.730
here to be a part of today's gathering.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:00.180
So that means Lord, that
your word was spoke.

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:03.450
Your word was exhorted and taught.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.279
And you said, Lord,
that it will not return.

00:44:07.049 --> 00:44:11.310
I said today, that's what we're praying
and believing that the word was spoke that

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:12.899
is received into our hearts and lives.

00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:18.240
And that each one of us, each one of us,
including myself, will respond to it.

00:44:18.779 --> 00:44:21.600
Lord, I pray if there's someone in
this room that is struggling to take

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.080
that next step, Lord, give them that
confidence to take that next step.

00:44:26.339 --> 00:44:28.410
Or if there's someone that
doesn't know you, Lord pray.

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:31.709
I pray that you give them the
confidence to take the next step, to

00:44:31.709 --> 00:44:35.040
say that they need you, and that they
want to know what it's like to have.

00:44:37.395 --> 00:44:41.295
Or move in the hearts and lives of every
person in this room, because we know Lord

00:44:41.295 --> 00:44:42.795
that you desire for them to know you more.

00:44:43.695 --> 00:44:45.165
So Lord, thank you for this time.

00:44:45.405 --> 00:44:47.685
We love you and we pray
this in your heavenly name.

00:44:48.315 --> 00:44:48.615
Amen.

00:44:48.885 --> 00:44:49.185
Amen.
