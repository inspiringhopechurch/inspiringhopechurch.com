00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.420
Well, good morning.

Um, something's happening over
here cuz all there is is laughing.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.770
Oh, that's a season of giving.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.430
I didn't know it was
Bring your own snacks day.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.020
Did we mail that out?

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.130
I mean, you know, that was sent
for your kids to bring snacks.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.900
Not for Oh, it's okay.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.800
I did all the hard work.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.220
Okay.

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:32.955
All right, next week, bring your snack.

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:35.025
Just make sure you have enough to share.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:40.125
Um, well, uh, great
morning to see everybody.

00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:45.945
Um, super excited to continue our
series, um, talking about he shall

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:49.364
be called, um, and it's talking
about the coming of Jesus in these

00:00:49.364 --> 00:00:51.885
names in which Isaiah the prophet.

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:56.475
Talked about the names of the coming
Messiah, and, uh, we get to break

00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:59.955
those down and talk about what those
mean to us and what that obviously

00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:02.535
meant to the people that he was
writing to in that time as well.

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:06.495
And, um, today we get to this
point where he mentions the

00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:09.675
name of Jesus as mighty God.

00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:15.225
And whenever I was thinking through
this, um, series of walking through,

00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:17.865
talking about Christmas, talking
about the coming Messiah and

00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:20.085
the, the word or the name mighty.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.390
I was one of those I, I really like,
I was get, I was getting excited

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.080
because the more and more that I looked
into that name and the more and more

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.610
that I understood what that meant
to me, I was excited to make sure,

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:35.759
like one that we, we all understand.

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:38.865
How mighty God is.

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:41.985
And so we're gonna get to dive
into that today a little bit more.

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:45.225
And so if you weren't here last week when
we had our first part of our serious,

00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:47.385
um, I'll catch you up a little bit.

00:01:47.445 --> 00:01:52.725
Um, but the first one we talked about was
that Jesus is our wonderful counselor.

00:01:53.265 --> 00:01:58.515
Um, and it's awesome to hear and to
see how much God knew we needed a

00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:00.225
wonderful counselor in our lives.

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:06.075
Um, but I wanna start off by
asking, um, if you've ever seen.

00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:07.665
, the Truman Show.

00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:09.015
Anybody ever seen the Truman Show?

00:02:09.705 --> 00:02:10.005
Okay.

00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:12.015
Um, I remember watching it.

00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:16.125
And, um, it's kind of one of those
moments whenever, uh, you see him

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:19.755
go through this life and, and,
and he's thinking it's all real.

00:02:19.755 --> 00:02:22.905
And then when he begins to see
that it's not real and, and that

00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:24.375
life all around him is fake.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.695
His, his wife isn't real.

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:26.685
His friends aren't real.

00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:28.095
The son isn't real.

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:30.645
I mean, where he's living,
it's just not real at all.

00:02:31.065 --> 00:02:33.075
Um, I kinda get angry.

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.540
When people like are going through
the situations in which they're

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.220
unaware of what's going on.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.459
And, and so typically when I watch
those movies, I don't enjoy them.

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.010
I just get angry because
how dare them put?

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.570
But anyway, there's more to this.

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.019
But when you think about the Truman
Show, you think about how much everything

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.179
that he was living for was fake.

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.230
It was not real.

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.859
Um, and then I begin to think about my
life before giving my life to Christ.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.920
Everything that I had experie.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.459
Was not real.

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.470
What I was living for was not real.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.600
What, what I was thinking that my
life was designed for was not real.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.279
And how at times, even as a believer,
and this is the tough part, even as a

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:18.630
believer, some of the things in which I
allow into my life, whenever I'm choosing

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:24.660
sin over what God's plan is for my life,
I'm experiencing what I would call is,

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.850
is not what God has designed for me.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.820
It's, it's a.

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:29.055
Reality.

00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:32.025
It's, it's something
that does not fulfill me.

00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:36.255
Um, and, and I would even say a little
bit more when I think about this,

00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:38.415
it's this idea of feeling empty.

00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:42.645
And, uh, I I, I think of this quote,
uh, by Robbie Zacharias that says this

00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:47.025
sin will take us farther than we want
to go, keep us longer than we wanna stay

00:03:47.235 --> 00:03:50.025
and cost us more than we want to pay.

00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:56.205
And so I started thinking, What is sin
like right when we live that life that's

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:58.065
outside of God's plan for our life?

00:03:58.665 --> 00:04:01.845
Um, and and again, thinking that Truman
show and that he didn't understand

00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:05.595
what he was missing until he realized
that things around him was not reality.

00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:07.695
And what is it like?

00:04:08.055 --> 00:04:09.315
And then it just hit me.

00:04:09.855 --> 00:04:14.835
Anybody ever been like really, really
hungry and ate a lot of like junk food?

00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:17.144
What happens?

00:04:19.185 --> 00:04:21.585
One, it satisfies you for like
a moment cause you enjoyed the.

00:04:22.335 --> 00:04:25.844
But you crash, you end up feeling empty.

00:04:26.175 --> 00:04:29.985
You end up feeling like
you need substance there.

00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:33.015
There's seasons in mine and Britt's
life where we'll catch ourselves

00:04:33.285 --> 00:04:35.925
eating out a lot, and all of a sudden
we're just like, we just need a salad.

00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:36.765
Anybody ever feel that way?

00:04:36.765 --> 00:04:37.575
You just need a salad.

00:04:37.575 --> 00:04:39.255
You just feel like that's
gonna make you feel healthy?

00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:39.645
Right?

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:41.295
I think of it this way.

00:04:41.295 --> 00:04:44.415
When we are choosing to sin, when
we're choosing not to follow God's

00:04:44.415 --> 00:04:50.205
plan for our life, we are experiencing
maybe initial satisfaction.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.000
, but long term satisfaction
is unfulfilling.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.370
So here's the question.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.170
You're wondering, where
the heck am I going?

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.530
How does this make sense
when it comes to mighty God?

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.060
I would say this.

00:05:03.065 --> 00:05:07.170
There's people all over the world,
all over our city, maybe even here

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.120
today, that are substituting the
season of Christmas, the joys of

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.340
the world, and they're substituting
it in replacement of a abundant.

00:05:18.674 --> 00:05:20.715
Amazing relationship with Jesus.

00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:24.525
They're, they're substituting
all the, the, the things which

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:25.724
we would call of the flesh.

00:05:25.724 --> 00:05:28.335
Things that are not going
to fulfill us long term.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.804
That there's always seems
to be something missing.

00:05:29.984 --> 00:05:35.385
They're choosing those and sometimes
we choose those over ultimately

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.354
what God has given us through a
personal relationship with him.

00:05:39.224 --> 00:05:41.234
So what I'm not saying though,
and this is what I communicated

00:05:41.234 --> 00:05:44.054
last week, if you enjoy Christmas,
we have Christmas trees up here.

00:05:44.205 --> 00:05:45.075
We like lights.

00:05:45.164 --> 00:05:45.885
That's not a bad.

00:05:46.815 --> 00:05:51.705
. But when those things become priority
over our relationships with Christ,

00:05:51.825 --> 00:05:53.085
that's when we have a problem.

00:05:53.715 --> 00:05:55.125
And that, that's the things that I see.

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:58.304
Why are we talking about this
during the season of Christmas?

00:05:58.335 --> 00:06:03.945
Because Christmas can easily distract us
with parties, lights, no offense, cookies.

00:06:04.005 --> 00:06:04.934
We like your cookies.

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:12.195
Okay, good cookies, um, food, family
gifts, and those things are great.

00:06:12.555 --> 00:06:18.015
But if those things consume us to the
point where we miss that this is a season

00:06:18.165 --> 00:06:24.495
that Jesus, or that God sent Jesus to
this earth to be a mighty God, for us

00:06:24.615 --> 00:06:28.725
to transform our lives, to give us a
hope, to give us peace, to give us joy,

00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:34.365
to fulfill us, to not have that fake
feeling of, of fulfillment like we have

00:06:34.365 --> 00:06:39.015
with candy or, or junk food, but to have
a nourishment, that good steak that we

00:06:39.015 --> 00:06:41.865
like having right when we are choosing.

00:06:43.034 --> 00:06:46.695
those things we are missing
out on this season that God has

00:06:47.075 --> 00:06:49.094
designed for us in Christmas.

00:06:49.305 --> 00:06:52.305
So what have we learned so far just
as we've been going through this text?

00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:54.315
So you know, we're in Isaiah chapter nine.

00:06:54.615 --> 00:06:56.145
We're recovering verses six and seven.

00:06:56.145 --> 00:06:57.854
If you're wondering,
we read that last week.

00:06:58.034 --> 00:06:59.775
We're gonna read it this week
and we'll read it next week

00:06:59.775 --> 00:07:00.525
and we'll read it next week.

00:07:00.765 --> 00:07:04.784
We're gonna continue to build off of
that text, but what we learned last.

00:07:06.284 --> 00:07:10.425
. Uh, it is just this idea that even
when God's greatest creation, humans,

00:07:10.665 --> 00:07:15.075
and in this case it was the people of
Israel or the people of Judah, even

00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:19.455
when his greatest creation chose sin
over what God had for them, God's

00:07:19.455 --> 00:07:22.745
plans, God did not stop pursuing them.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.040
so that they could experience a
perfect relationship with him.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.160
And this is where we see
Jesus come into the story.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.690
God had a plan even when his people
were running from him, to send a

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.710
Messiah, a savior to this world,
to be a mighty counselor and a

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.750
wonderful God and a mighty God.

00:07:41.235 --> 00:07:43.725
and, and we see this today in this text.

00:07:43.725 --> 00:07:48.705
And so I want to read this text
and then I want to jump in and, uh,

00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:49.785
talk a little bit more about it.

00:07:49.785 --> 00:07:54.165
So here's is Isaiah chapter nine, uh,
verses six and seven says, this, for

00:07:54.165 --> 00:08:01.435
child will be born for us, a son will be
given to us and the government will be

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.855
on his shoulders and he will be named.

00:08:04.155 --> 00:08:05.505
Wonderful counselor.

00:08:05.775 --> 00:08:08.075
Mighty God, eternal father.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.560
Prince of peace and the dominion will be
vast and its prosperity will never end,

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.300
and he will reign on the throne of David
and over his kingdom to establish and

00:08:18.305 --> 00:08:21.840
sustain it with justice and righteousness.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:26.610
From now on and forever, the zeal of
the Lord of Armies will accomplish this.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.930
So let's pray.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.410
Lord Jesus, we pray, Lord, that as we
read your word, as we talk about your

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:37.169
word today, Lord, may we, um, Lord, leave
outta here change because we understand

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:42.480
how mighty you are in our lives and the
mighty plans in which you have for us

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.710
to fulfill through us and to experience
through a personal relationship with you.

00:08:47.325 --> 00:08:51.945
Lord, help us, uh, have open minds, open
hearts, open ears, Lord, to your word.

00:08:52.425 --> 00:08:56.385
And, uh, may we continue to, uh,
know you more and more, um, every

00:08:56.385 --> 00:08:58.605
day that we study your word, and
we pray this in your heavily name.

00:08:58.985 --> 00:08:59.475
Amen.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.190
. So as we saw last week, we talked about
him being a wonderful counselor, right?

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.900
And we really summarized it this
way, uh, as Jesus being our wonderful

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.220
counselor, Jesus is above anything in
the world that we can comprehend when

00:09:14.225 --> 00:09:18.270
it comes to guiding and directing our
lives, experiencing what God has for

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.650
us, and I would say it this way, is
that God sent a wonderful counselor

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.710
Jesus into our lives because he knew we.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.480
he knew we needed it.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.180
It's those moments where sometimes
we don't know what we need.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.390
Uh, and I think about
it this way as my kids.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.464
Um, There's times where we do
things for them that they don't

00:09:36.464 --> 00:09:38.115
know that they need done for them.

00:09:38.175 --> 00:09:38.385
Why?

00:09:38.385 --> 00:09:39.375
Because they're kids.

00:09:39.915 --> 00:09:45.405
Well, in essence, we are children
of God and God is sending his son

00:09:45.405 --> 00:09:50.055
Jesus, and he sent his son Jesus
to fulfill a need that we had, and

00:09:50.055 --> 00:09:51.915
that is to be a wonderful counselor.

00:09:51.915 --> 00:09:52.185
Right?

00:09:52.189 --> 00:09:55.365
And, and we need that because we have
an enemy that is constantly trying to

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:59.745
distract us and in order to fulfill what
God has called for us to do to know him.

00:09:59.745 --> 00:09:59.954
Person.

00:10:00.715 --> 00:10:01.915
To be used by God.

00:10:02.064 --> 00:10:04.465
He needed to send Jesus to guide us in.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.500
And so I want to kind of give a
little bit of background just like

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.900
I did last week to make sure that
all of us are on the same page.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.219
But Isaiah, uh, the book of Isaiah
is a, is a book written by a prophet.

00:10:14.219 --> 00:10:17.609
Prophets were known to
prophesy about the future.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:17.910
Right.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.319
That makes logical sense, right?

00:10:19.324 --> 00:10:22.890
But he was a prophet and he came
out and, and most of this you're

00:10:22.895 --> 00:10:26.040
gonna see in the book of Isaiah
is he's gonna cast judgment.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.069
He's gonna proclaim judgment
on Judah and Israel.

00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:31.469
And we talked about last week the
difference between Judah and Israel.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.630
Used to be a, a tribe of, of a God, right?

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.590
It's God's people.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.700
Um, and they end up dividing and breaking
up into two different groups, the

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.650
tribe of Israel and the tribe of Judah.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.830
Um, and we learned a little bit more
about that last week, but this tribe of

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.930
Judah is the southern part of Israel.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.400
Um, and.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.270
Isaiah is writing and he's saying, Hey,
there's judgment that is coming on you.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.510
Um, you're going to be sent off
into exile and there's going to

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.870
be a season where you're there and
then God's gonna bring you back and

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.820
restore you and rebuild some things.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:07.410
But ultimately he ends up not just
talking about judgment to these people.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.430
He's talking about hope.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.450
And I think a lot of times, and I, I
actually got a chance to talk to somebody

00:11:12.455 --> 00:11:15.810
yesterday, um, and we were talking
a little bit about church and he has

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:20.324
had a bad church experience and one of
the things he said is, The reason why

00:11:20.324 --> 00:11:25.245
he struggles with believing in Jesus
is because all he ever hears is that

00:11:25.245 --> 00:11:29.444
he's going to hell and judgment, which
I, I would say this, that we all need

00:11:29.444 --> 00:11:31.484
to know that at at at in our lives.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.175
That if we do not repent of our sins,
that there is judgment on our lives.

00:11:35.834 --> 00:11:38.625
But I think too many times, and this
is the reason why you'll probably

00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:41.655
hear me say that consistently cuz we
do need to know the consequences of

00:11:41.895 --> 00:11:43.665
our sin is eternal separation from.

00:11:44.505 --> 00:11:48.464
We need to hear that, but I would think
just like what Isaiah has seen here

00:11:48.464 --> 00:11:52.454
and just like what we see Jesus, more
of what we need to hear is that there

00:11:52.454 --> 00:11:58.155
is a hope and a help in Jesus, that
Jesus came to save that which was lost.

00:11:58.665 --> 00:12:05.025
His whole ultimate goal was to save
us from ourselves just like we are

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:08.775
trying to protect our kids and we save
them from themselves by grabbing their

00:12:08.775 --> 00:12:09.885
hand before they run out in front of.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.710
, and that sounds logical to us because
we're trying to save their lives.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:18.090
Well, Jesus was sent so that
he could grab our hands before

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.410
we crossed the road to Hell.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.840
And you may say, well, that
just doesn't seem right.

00:12:21.845 --> 00:12:23.850
Why do we even have to even
have the option to go to hell?

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.910
Because of us, because of our sin?

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.040
God didn't want us to go to hell.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.200
That was our choice.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.170
When we choose sin over
God, that is our choice.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.860
So the reason why I'm bringing this
up is, Isaiah's not just talking about

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.940
judgment, he's talking about hope
and the hope of a coming Messiah.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.180
And so that's where we see
here on our side of history.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.750
We get to look back because we've
already seen that Jesus has come, this

00:12:48.755 --> 00:12:50.190
coming Messiah that he's talking about.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.070
We've already seen Jesus
come, he's already seen him.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.930
If, if you've given your life to
Christ, you've already seen that he

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.610
has fulfilling, uh, hope in your life
and he's giving, um, purpose to your.

00:13:00.475 --> 00:13:02.425
But we are still seeing judgment.

00:13:02.425 --> 00:13:06.025
We're still seeing distractions and
brokenness in our lives, and I would

00:13:06.025 --> 00:13:12.145
say this, this hope is sometimes easy to
forget because if you're going through a

00:13:12.145 --> 00:13:15.745
difficult time, or if you're struggling
or if you're seeing the world around

00:13:15.745 --> 00:13:19.555
you, or if you're seeing things that are
just wrecking your life from health to

00:13:19.555 --> 00:13:24.745
family to just difficult situations, you
may wonder where is the hope in this?

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:28.435
Well, this is why I believe
that we have Christmas.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.900
This is why we celebrate Christmas.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:38.130
It's because Christmas reminds us who
Jesus is, who Jesus is, and why he came.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:43.020
And so the true season of Christmas
is Christ came so that we could

00:13:43.025 --> 00:13:46.020
be saved and have a personal
relationship with him and experience

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.550
hope in the midst of our trials.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.880
Experience, love and forgiveness
in the midst of our broken.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.300
And to understand that God
has mighty plans for us.

00:13:54.305 --> 00:13:57.390
I remember reading this quote earlier
this week that Billy Graham quoted.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:01.770
He says, the very purpose of Christ
coming into the world was that

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:06.630
he might offer up his life as a
sacrifice for the sins of man.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.800
He came to die, and this
is the heart of Christmas.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.890
C Christmas.

00:14:11.895 --> 00:14:17.220
So when we look at now, the, the name
in which Isaiah wrote about, right, we

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.270
already talked about wonderful counselor.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.680
Now he says, mighty.

00:14:20.715 --> 00:14:23.205
When we look at Mighty God, the
first thing I want you to look at

00:14:23.205 --> 00:14:24.885
is he says his name shall be called.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.630
Why are names important?

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:31.170
If you go and study anything in the
Old Testament, names were given,

00:14:31.175 --> 00:14:32.880
not just because they sounded cool.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.330
And so, you know, whenever me and
Britney chose a lot of our kids'

00:14:36.335 --> 00:14:39.240
names, they're unique, but we didn't
just choose them cuz they're unique.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.470
We actually looked at their meaning and
we, we wanted it to align with something

00:14:43.475 --> 00:14:47.190
that we did believe and something that
we saw in them and, and what we thought.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:52.510
And so names are important because,
When we look at these names, one

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:55.209
Jesus' name would be his reputation.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.980
It would be what he was known for.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.339
And we would also look at this
specifically, is that the names

00:15:00.344 --> 00:15:03.730
of God are important because
it connects us to his identity.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.699
It connects us to Jesus's identity.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.870
And so I, I've taken an example here
and this is gonna be, um, great.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:11.980
Cause I don't even think Matt's in here.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.819
I think Matt's serving.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.810
This is really great.

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:16.150
So I started just, I randomly
thought of somebody and I started

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.010
thinking, how do I identify?

00:15:18.719 --> 00:15:21.240
Like, I don't even know what
Matt's definition of his name is,

00:15:21.449 --> 00:15:25.469
but if I know Matt, that's Matt
is who leads up here on guitar.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.400
Matt is someone who is honest and genuine.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.430
He's someone who is an
encourager, he's creative.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.439
I know that he's a follower
of Jesus, and so whatever.

00:15:34.439 --> 00:15:37.410
I talk to Matt, whatever I, I, I know him.

00:15:37.439 --> 00:15:40.170
I, I identify him with these things.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:45.060
So when we think of Jesus, this coming
Messiah, that we have a personal

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.390
relationship, or if you haven't given
your life to, to him, that you can

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.380
have a personal relationship with him.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.560
These names are important for us.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.070
So when we think of Jesus, we think
of him as this wonderful counselor and

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.420
this mighty God in this Savior because
we've experienced him in this way.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.680
So let's break this down.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.870
Mighty and God, mighty means
strong, brave, powerful.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.870
Warrior Champion, chief Giant.

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:12.359
Um, that's not just
names of football teams.

00:16:12.599 --> 00:16:14.339
It's, it's actually Jesus.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.859
Um, but then he talks about mighty God.

00:16:16.864 --> 00:16:21.180
God is a creator, a ruler of the
universe, the source of all authority

00:16:21.359 --> 00:16:24.300
above all, all knowing and in control.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.600
So here's just a translation of
what I, Isaiah is saying here.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:32.940
Jesus, the coming Messiah is stronger
and more powerful than anything else

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.590
that has ever been created or made.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:39.060
Jesus is above all and is in all
knowing and in control of everything.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:46.230
Now, just because Jesus has
that name doesn't does not

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.370
mean that you identify him.

00:16:48.615 --> 00:16:52.935
that when I begin to study more
and more about Jesus being my

00:16:52.935 --> 00:16:57.555
mighty God, your mighty God, I
started asking this question, but

00:16:57.555 --> 00:17:00.135
do I believe he is a mighty God?

00:17:00.825 --> 00:17:02.565
So it just like, I mean it.

00:17:02.805 --> 00:17:04.605
This is where I come back
to the whole Matt thing.

00:17:04.935 --> 00:17:08.464
Matt could say, Hey, I'm an awesome guy.

00:17:08.464 --> 00:17:09.525
I'm a pretty cool dude.

00:17:09.555 --> 00:17:10.335
I'm creative.

00:17:10.724 --> 00:17:15.944
But if I don't believe
that he may be, but I may.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.610
View him that way.

00:17:17.615 --> 00:17:21.300
I may not recognize him as that
way, and I know Jesus is, Jesus

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.360
is way better than Matt and Matt's
son here to defend himself in that.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.480
But I'm trying to give you some
practical example here in this idea of

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.630
Jesus can be something and, and, and.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.630
But the question is, do we
identify Jesus as a mighty God?

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:38.490
I think that's the posing question
that I pray from this point forward,

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:43.740
that you begin to ask yourself,
is Jesus mighty God in my life?

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.660
Do I identify Jesus?

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.190
As a mighty God.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.140
And that may be a tough question for
you to answer, but I would love for

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:57.360
you if you have experienced Jesus as
mighty God to share a time in your life

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.210
where you have seen him as mighty God.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.030
So I'm gonna say that again, and
then I'm gonna answer one so that

00:18:03.035 --> 00:18:03.990
you have time to think about it.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.890
But how has Jesus been
a mighty God in your.

00:18:08.955 --> 00:18:13.695
Give just a short answer of what you've
seen, where God has shown up in that way.

00:18:14.115 --> 00:18:17.715
And again, where he was stronger,
more powerful than anything else.

00:18:17.865 --> 00:18:19.574
He showed up and showed out.

00:18:19.754 --> 00:18:22.905
So let me give you a mind so that
you can think for a few minutes.

00:18:23.084 --> 00:18:26.205
There's two things that just came to mind,
but I could probably go on and on and on.

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:30.975
One of those is back when our,
um, youngest daughter, Tegan, um,

00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:34.125
right after she was born, a month
after she was born, she went into.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:35.700
The emergency room.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.140
She was life flighted.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.180
Um, she was hanging on for dear life.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.340
Um, basically almost lost her life.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.760
And I remember them telling us
that we needed to expect the worst.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.170
And in those moments when we
begin to pray and we begin to see

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.360
God work, he was a mighty God.

00:18:51.365 --> 00:18:52.890
He healed her.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.450
And all the doctors have no
clue why all of that happened.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.590
And in that moment, we
recognized God as a mighty.

00:19:02.805 --> 00:19:04.635
And he, and that's a short story of it.

00:19:04.635 --> 00:19:06.795
If you want a longer one, we'll
give you a longer one another day.

00:19:06.795 --> 00:19:12.195
But the short of that is that God showed
up in a mighty way above anything anybody

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.325
could have controlled and he showed up.

00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:18.585
But I would also mention if I could
probably mention about 27 different

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.625
times in my spiritual journey.

00:19:21.465 --> 00:19:22.935
Where God has showed up financially.

00:19:22.965 --> 00:19:25.455
Does anybody ever struggle with finances
where it seems like you don't have enough

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:28.245
and it seems like something breaks and
you don't know how you're gonna pay for it

00:19:28.245 --> 00:19:29.685
and you don't know how you're gonna do it?

00:19:29.865 --> 00:19:33.135
Well, I think that's probably happened
to us about a hundred times, but at

00:19:33.135 --> 00:19:35.385
least 27 of those, God was mighty.

00:19:35.415 --> 00:19:39.885
Where there was times where
financially, somehow God showed up

00:19:39.885 --> 00:19:41.415
and I don't even know how it worked.

00:19:42.645 --> 00:19:42.855
Okay.

00:19:42.855 --> 00:19:43.754
He was mighty every time.

00:19:43.815 --> 00:19:44.115
Okay.

00:19:44.595 --> 00:19:46.185
My wife's gonna correct me in my wording.

00:19:46.335 --> 00:19:46.575
Okay.

00:19:46.575 --> 00:19:49.695
He was mighty every time, but
in the way in which she showed.

00:19:51.135 --> 00:19:53.535
Um, I'll just even give
you a great example.

00:19:53.955 --> 00:19:55.995
Whenever we were saying, Hey,
we really feel like God's called

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:57.375
us to move here to Cincinnati.

00:19:57.705 --> 00:20:00.405
Um, we had no clue how
we were gonna get here.

00:20:00.645 --> 00:20:03.525
Um, financially we're like, we just
feel like God's called us here.

00:20:03.915 --> 00:20:08.625
Um, and within, um, really cuz we
had to delay fundraising for a while.

00:20:08.655 --> 00:20:11.385
Within three months we raised all
the support we needed to move here.

00:20:11.685 --> 00:20:14.625
And whenever they told us to write
down all the names of people that

00:20:14.625 --> 00:20:16.785
could help us fundraise to move here.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.010
I wrote down about 10 names
in two churches, and I said,

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:20.700
well, that's all I got.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.110
And they're like, you're
gonna need a longer list.

00:20:22.409 --> 00:20:24.270
And somehow God showed up.

00:20:24.419 --> 00:20:26.340
Well, why did God show up?

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.710
Because God is mighty.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.040
And, and, and I begin to think through
these things, and I'm gonna give

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.270
you a chance now to share yours.

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:37.740
But when I think about what is is, is
God mighty, God is mighty in the fact

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.330
that he is in control of everything.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.560
And it comes to us recognizing
God in those situations.

00:20:44.565 --> 00:20:47.295
Those are the big things, but
there's some small things.

00:20:47.325 --> 00:20:51.135
I'll just tell you this, that, that
you're living and breathing today

00:20:51.165 --> 00:20:54.045
is a a mighty God type of thing.

00:20:54.285 --> 00:20:58.665
The way in which our body functions,
the way in which we have life and

00:20:58.665 --> 00:21:00.765
babies are created and formed.

00:21:00.825 --> 00:21:02.175
That is amazing.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.795
But sometimes we look
at that as just a, eh.

00:21:04.185 --> 00:21:05.025
That happens all the time.

00:21:05.475 --> 00:21:07.035
That's even God being mighty.

00:21:07.035 --> 00:21:09.345
So now that I've given you plenty
of time, there should be at least

00:21:09.345 --> 00:21:12.465
three people that shares give me.

00:21:13.575 --> 00:21:17.295
Something, some story where
God was mighty in your life.

00:21:20.265 --> 00:21:20.445
Yeah.

00:21:21.555 --> 00:21:21.905
So.

00:21:29.889 --> 00:21:30.370
Driving

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.990
about an hour and a

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:45.580
walk.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.220
Oh God, I'm , so I.

00:22:02.175 --> 00:22:03.195
Yeah, I love it.

00:22:12.705 --> 00:22:13.555
Absolutely.

00:22:13.605 --> 00:22:14.275
Awesome.

00:22:14.275 --> 00:22:15.115
Thank you for sharing.

00:22:16.315 --> 00:22:19.595
Somebody else, share time
when God was mighty in your.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:03.900
That's awesome.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:06.090
I love how God connects those stories.

00:23:06.595 --> 00:23:10.230
because that's the cool part, is
he uses all of us to, to be mighty

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.620
like God created all of us to, to
create these opportunities, right.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.200
To, to come together and fulfill
needs that are being met.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.980
That's awesome.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.450
One more, somebody else.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.230
Mighty God.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.030
How is he mighty in your life?

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:24.440
Mm-hmm.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:27.700
Perfect.

00:24:23.355 --> 00:24:23.834
Better.

00:24:27.465 --> 00:24:27.705
Mm-hmm.

00:24:32.445 --> 00:24:32.594
Yeah.

00:24:33.435 --> 00:24:33.794
Cool.

00:24:33.915 --> 00:24:34.514
That's awesome.

00:24:34.995 --> 00:24:35.445
That's awesome.

00:24:35.594 --> 00:24:35.895
You got so.

00:24:38.445 --> 00:24:38.774
Okay.

00:24:39.195 --> 00:24:41.625
Yeah, so Christie's speaking through you.

00:24:41.655 --> 00:24:41.865
Okay.

00:24:41.865 --> 00:24:42.075
Let's.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.360
And the doctor goes, why aren't you?

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:43.260
Wow.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.730
That's crazy.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:00.210
Yeah.

00:26:17.085 --> 00:26:17.625
Wow.

00:26:21.185 --> 00:26:21.675
Yeah.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.305
That's crazy.

00:26:22.995 --> 00:26:23.715
That's crazy.

00:26:23.985 --> 00:26:24.375
Wow.

00:26:25.155 --> 00:26:28.365
See, I think if you, if you sat here
long enough, we'd probably all have

00:26:28.365 --> 00:26:32.504
some story where we've seen God be
mighty and, and here's the part,

00:26:32.504 --> 00:26:34.705
at times we don't even recognize.

00:26:35.774 --> 00:26:37.334
How mighty God is in our life.

00:26:37.334 --> 00:26:40.366
He's working even though we
aren't even recognizing it.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:44.324
And I think that's the unique part
of this story when we recognize God

00:26:44.324 --> 00:26:46.725
as being mighty in doing things.

00:26:47.115 --> 00:26:51.854
But at times, the thing that I recognize
is, I, I kind of flip a little bit

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.485
here, is we miss seeing God is mighty.

00:26:55.485 --> 00:26:59.354
Because what happens is, is we
start worshiping the creation.

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:00.870
Rather than creator.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.030
So give you a great example here.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:07.260
We start trusting in our
money over God's provision.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:12.540
We start trusting in our own strength
and our own ability to change the

00:27:12.545 --> 00:27:15.750
situation than God's strength and
his ability to change the situation.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:20.460
We start trusting, trusting media and
the world and professionals over and so,

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.590
so you understand I'm not anti any of.

00:27:24.284 --> 00:27:27.915
. But what we end up doing and, and so
you know what I end up doing and I

00:27:27.915 --> 00:27:32.085
just wanna give you an example, is
when we've had financial troubles,

00:27:32.085 --> 00:27:32.985
cuz I'm going back to this.

00:27:33.315 --> 00:27:35.685
My first thing is how
can I go work harder?

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.230
To meet those needs.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.020
Now, I don't think God doesn't
want me to work hard to meet those

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:45.120
needs, but I'm not even seeking the
Lord to provide in a mighty way.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.970
I'm just trying to figure out how
fleshly can I go make this happen.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.020
And in those moments that I begin
to pursue how to figure it out on my

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.280
own, you know what ends up happening?

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.330
I end up being stressed.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:55.740
I have anxiety.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.920
I'm, I'm, I'm like, it just wrecks me.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.070
And in those moments, it's like
God's just waiting on me to say,

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.830
do you recognize how big a God I.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:09.960
That is, is every day keeping you
alive every day, helping you be able

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.500
to do what you are able to do, and
you're not even asking for my help.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.490
You're not even asking.

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:17.400
And that's where humility comes
in because most of the time we're

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.050
not willing to humble ourselves.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.620
And so whenever we think about those
examples, have you ever gotten that

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.730
out of order where you've end up
trusting something or someone else

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.080
rather than God in your situation?

00:28:29.995 --> 00:28:33.225
I think we have, and that's where
we, we get this out of order.

00:28:33.225 --> 00:28:35.504
And, and why do we get that out of order?

00:28:35.895 --> 00:28:42.615
Because we forget and, and I've
preached enough messages even here that

00:28:42.645 --> 00:28:44.824
we consistently forget to remember.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.330
And that's why if you'll study your
Bible, I think even Matt had a number the

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:49.320
other day when I was talking with him.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.280
It's like over 500 times in the
Bible where it says, remember why?

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:58.590
Because we easily forget that God is
mighty, that God is creator, that God is

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:03.180
sovereign, that God is the one that can
counsel and guide and direct us because he

00:29:03.185 --> 00:29:07.980
is the one that created everything and he
is the one that can walk with us and guide

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.040
us and direct us in everything that we.

00:29:10.465 --> 00:29:13.645
And so it's important that we don't
remember or so that we don't forget to

00:29:13.645 --> 00:29:17.905
remember that Jesus is our mighty God
because we will end up doubting and

00:29:17.905 --> 00:29:19.615
choosing other things to put our trust in.

00:29:20.095 --> 00:29:23.965
We'll miss out on experiencing
God's best for us.

00:29:24.625 --> 00:29:28.435
When we see Jesus as our mighty God,
we understand a couple of key things.

00:29:28.915 --> 00:29:33.504
One, whenever a God is leading
us, he will provide for us.

00:29:33.985 --> 00:29:36.326
And I would say this, if you are
seeking the Lord and you're saying

00:29:36.331 --> 00:29:40.410
Lord, . Lord, lead me just like
we did when we said, Lord, lead us

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.430
when we're coming to Cincinnati.

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:42.780
We don't know how the
heck we're gonna get here.

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:46.650
When we trusted the Lord in
faith, God took care of the rest.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:52.500
So I would say this, where God guides
you, God provides for you, not just

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.670
financially, but we're talking.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:57.270
Everything opens doors, provides
opportunities where God guides

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.440
you, God provides for you.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.600
Where do we see that in the Bible?

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.350
Two different ones.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:02.220
I wanna give you an example.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:02.610
Number one.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.670
You remember whenever Jesus
was walking on the water and

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.470
Peter says, is this you Lord?

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:08.220
And he's like, yeah.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.770
And he's like, well, if it's you, then
you know, have me come out on the water.

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:11.550
And Jesus says, come.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.889
And so whenever Peter had
faith, he was walking on water.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.629
But the moment that he began to get
distracted by creation, the wind

00:30:21.629 --> 00:30:23.790
and the waves, he began to sink.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:27.960
See, that's one example in the Bible
where we see that another one is,

00:30:29.175 --> 00:30:33.344
Remember the story of Abraham, and uh,
God says, Hey, wake up and you need to

00:30:33.344 --> 00:30:35.235
go and you need to go sacrifice your son.

00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:38.115
And Abraham, you know what the Bible says?

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.905
Abraham says, Abraham got up and went.

00:30:41.745 --> 00:30:46.620
And on the way his son asked him,
dad, where's the sacrifice that

00:30:46.725 --> 00:30:48.105
we're gonna sacrifice up here?

00:30:48.405 --> 00:30:50.175
And he's like, God will provide.

00:30:51.584 --> 00:30:56.264
And in every one of those
instances, Abraham didn't know.

00:30:56.879 --> 00:31:00.270
He didn't know, like in the fact of
like physically having to sacrifice

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:01.350
with him other than his son.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.350
But he trusted the Lord.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:07.770
He trusted the Lord because he
understood he was a mighty God.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.060
And what did God do?

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.450
God provided a sacrifice.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.810
He never intended Abraham
to sacrifice his son.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.840
That was so if you're trying to
wonder what the heck, that's crazy.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.180
He never intended, that
was never going to happen.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.930
He was always gonna provide a sacrifice,
but he was looking at Abraham's.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:33.120
This season of Christmas reminds us that
God has provided Jesus as our mighty God.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.440
That in those two instances of
the Bible and there's more of 'em,

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:41.220
that God will provide whatever
it is, he is a mighty God.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.270
I believe Matthew 6 33, and I quote
this a lot of times because I have to

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:49.380
remind where my priorities is, where
our priority is during Christmas,

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:53.670
but seek first the kingdom of God and
all these things will be provided.

00:31:54.885 --> 00:32:00.045
Too many times I catch myself
seeking the things of the world and

00:32:00.045 --> 00:32:03.945
just hoping that I figure it out
and then maybe God will bless it.

00:32:04.665 --> 00:32:06.345
But he says to seek
first the kingdom of God.

00:32:06.975 --> 00:32:10.245
And when things do get difficult,
we have to remember right God's

00:32:10.245 --> 00:32:11.685
word and cling to it in faith.

00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:17.355
Psalm 16 eight says this, I always
let the Lord guide me because he is my

00:32:17.355 --> 00:32:19.395
right hand and I will not be shaken.

00:32:21.405 --> 00:32:23.295
See, there's a difference though.

00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:27.330
When we say we believe
something, but then what?

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:27.540
Wow.

00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:28.320
Here's my statement.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.699
When the rubber meets the road, really
shows our true colors, what we believe in.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.820
And I was reading the devotional this week
and I love how God works things together.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.739
We're talking about building, you
know, building these connections.

00:32:37.739 --> 00:32:41.219
And so I'm studying for this text and
I'm in, I'm always consistently doing

00:32:41.219 --> 00:32:44.100
devotionals and this one devotional
just stuck out to me, and this is

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.129
what it says, and I'm reading it
specifically from this devotion.

00:32:47.135 --> 00:32:50.580
It says, it is one thing to
say we believe in God and it's

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.320
quite another thing to trust.

00:32:53.025 --> 00:32:56.175
When the bullets are flying,
he says, I'm pointing at the

00:32:56.175 --> 00:32:58.905
problem I call Christian atheism.

00:32:59.445 --> 00:33:01.935
How can a Christian possibly be atheism?

00:33:02.055 --> 00:33:02.685
Here's what he says.

00:33:02.685 --> 00:33:05.504
The phenomenon sounds like
a paradox because it is.

00:33:05.775 --> 00:33:09.015
We are Christians, but then
at the first hint of trouble,

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.515
we act like there's no God.

00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:14.715
We freak out and we rarely
and regularly flip out.

00:33:15.165 --> 00:33:19.155
We say we believe God is real,
but we live like he isn't.

00:33:19.695 --> 00:33:21.735
We trust him for eternal salvation.

00:33:22.605 --> 00:33:25.485
Then we act like he can't
handle our lives here on earth.

00:33:26.685 --> 00:33:27.315
Can I tell you that?

00:33:27.315 --> 00:33:31.784
I think that that's a problem in
a lot of our lives and even in my

00:33:31.784 --> 00:33:35.534
life at times, is that we believe
God is mighty enough for salvation.

00:33:35.534 --> 00:33:36.855
We've got that check mark.

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:41.504
I'm glad my eternity's secure, but
God's not big enough for you name it.

00:33:41.805 --> 00:33:44.385
You fill in the blank, and
I mentioned this last week.

00:33:44.475 --> 00:33:46.695
Sometimes we treat God
like life insurance.

00:33:47.895 --> 00:33:50.264
Life insurance is only
valuable when you're.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:54.420
I'll just tell you this.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.590
God did not send Jesus just to
give you a life insurance plan.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.190
We need to hear that today.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.790
I'll say that again.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:06.810
God did not send Jesus so that you
can just have a life insurance plan.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:09.720
Guess what?

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.380
We already have those.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.159
Without Jesus.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:12.330
They're fine.

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.929
They're there.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.310
Not the eternity obviously.

00:34:14.609 --> 00:34:15.600
We need that for Jesus.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.219
But I'm talking about
the life insurance plans.

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.159
What I'm saying is my wife's gonna
correct me after I get in with this.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.230
She can be like, you said
so many things wrong today.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:24.330
I'm not saying you can get
to heaven without Jesus.

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:25.350
That's not what I meant.

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:25.889
Okay.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:26.549
That's not what I meant.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.690
Um, but here's what I would say is
we struggle to see that Jesus is our

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:34.500
mighty God and the one who's in control
of all of our aspects of our life.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:34.889
Right.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:40.949
He's working to consistently draw us back
to him, and we only invite him in when

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:42.839
it's comfortable, when it's, we want.

00:34:43.455 --> 00:34:48.645
There not whenever God desires for
us to be in his life and him to be in

00:34:48.645 --> 00:34:50.655
our life every moment of every day.

00:34:51.825 --> 00:34:54.525
And so I go back to this idea
of the candy story, right?

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:55.605
The, the junk food.

00:34:56.895 --> 00:35:02.205
Too many times we fill ourselves
with the things of this world and

00:35:02.205 --> 00:35:04.545
it fulfills us for a time, a time.

00:35:05.385 --> 00:35:06.705
And then there's something missing.

00:35:07.365 --> 00:35:11.505
And God is saying that something
missing is a relationship with Jesus.

00:35:12.105 --> 00:35:15.885
I wanna be as clear as I can based upon
just my knowledge of God's word, my

00:35:15.885 --> 00:35:19.335
experience and my relationship with Jesus,
that when we think of Christmas and the

00:35:19.335 --> 00:35:24.855
story of Jesus and why he came to Earth,
it was more than to just be our savior.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.525
I, I believe that he came
to save us from our sins.

00:35:27.795 --> 00:35:32.205
He wants to do that, but Jesus didn't
come to save us from our sins and then

00:35:32.205 --> 00:35:35.415
free us to just sit, sleep, eat, and be.

00:35:37.379 --> 00:35:37.890
John 10.

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:43.920
10 says this, Jesus came so that
we might have life and that we

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.359
might have it more abundantly.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:47.670
What is the abundant life?

00:35:47.674 --> 00:35:49.560
As I begin to study what
is the abundant life?

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.290
We're not talking about just
being wealthy, healthy, and merry.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:58.529
What we is talking about is the abundant
life is experiencing Jesus as mighty God.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:02.700
Not just mighty God and
eternity, but mighty God.

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.630
Now, one who can do exceedingly,
abundantly more than we can ask or

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.210
think to the power that works in us.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.070
Ephesians three 20 tells us that.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.370
See, I'm reminded as I was
talking to someone last night

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.630
who's walking through a trial.

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:18.000
This is what I said to
her, God's word is truth.

00:36:18.029 --> 00:36:19.420
John 17, 17.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.570
Sometimes we have to remember to speak
God's word over our lives and remind us

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:28.170
who God is and what he is doing in our
lives, what He desires to do in our.

00:36:29.924 --> 00:36:34.964
So on the other side of our faith in Jesus
as mighty God as a life like no other.

00:36:35.714 --> 00:36:37.935
We could think of examples all
throughout the Bible, but I just

00:36:37.935 --> 00:36:38.774
wanna list a couple of them.

00:36:38.774 --> 00:36:44.234
Number one, if you have ever studied the
story of David and Goliath, there is no

00:36:44.234 --> 00:36:48.794
way that David should have ever defeated
Goliath, but do you wanna know how he

00:36:48.794 --> 00:36:51.404
did because he made this statement?

00:36:51.944 --> 00:36:54.825
How can Goliath stand up against.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.310
An army led by basically God who
would defy God's name like that.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.620
Why isn't somebody going and tearing it?

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.910
Basically him apart?

00:37:03.299 --> 00:37:07.259
His faith in God is what defeated
Goliath, not David's stones

00:37:07.265 --> 00:37:09.810
and his skills and his age.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.069
It was never that.

00:37:11.075 --> 00:37:14.520
It was his faith and belief
in God as being mighty.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:19.710
Think about Elijah and the prophets,
you know, and all the fire that came

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.930
down from heaven and consumed the offer.

00:37:22.815 --> 00:37:25.815
None of that was because
of Elijah and himself.

00:37:26.055 --> 00:37:29.295
It was God's mighty power to show up.

00:37:29.565 --> 00:37:30.674
That was a mighty God.

00:37:30.705 --> 00:37:34.725
Think about the 3000 people that
were saved at Pentecost when Peter

00:37:34.725 --> 00:37:38.505
preached, and if you ever know anything
about Peter, Peter was a failure.

00:37:38.565 --> 00:37:42.255
Just so you know, Peter was a failure
just like most of us at times.

00:37:42.674 --> 00:37:44.145
He had denied Jesus.

00:37:45.015 --> 00:37:46.785
He tend to get angry at times.

00:37:46.785 --> 00:37:48.685
He was not the greatest Charact.

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:54.839
Jesus used him to preach a message
in faith because he knew God was

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:58.470
a mighty God and because God was a
mighty God, 3000 people were saved.

00:37:59.129 --> 00:38:02.520
See, those are the stories of the Bible
that as I read them, I see them as truth.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.540
But I'll go back to what we did before and
some of you shared and some of you didn't.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.740
Some of you hopefully
thought of some things.

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.879
God has been mighty in your life, and
if you have forgotten that, I pray

00:38:11.879 --> 00:38:18.359
today that you remember that God has
been mighty, and then then go out.

00:38:19.529 --> 00:38:26.339
And live like God is mighty because
he is, he desires to do exceedingly,

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:30.240
abundantly, more than we could ask or
think through our lives, through faith.

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.390
So I, I wrote this down because
I started thinking this way.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:38.879
If Jesus was sitting here today,
what would he say to us as

00:38:38.879 --> 00:38:39.960
we're celebrating Christmas?

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.279
What would he say we should focus on?

00:38:41.339 --> 00:38:41.669
You know what?

00:38:41.669 --> 00:38:43.830
I think he would say, remember why I came?

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.240
I think he would say this, my
birth was a gift from God to.

00:38:49.365 --> 00:38:53.955
As we read here in verse six, it says,
for a child would be born for us, a son

00:38:53.955 --> 00:38:57.975
will be given to us and the government
will be on his shoulders all the way

00:38:57.975 --> 00:38:59.265
the world will be on his shoulders.

00:39:00.255 --> 00:39:03.705
He would say this, that he came so that
we could experience the forgiveness

00:39:03.705 --> 00:39:07.545
of our sins and the freedom, and I
want you to hear this, the freedom

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:12.075
to live life, the life that God has
called you to live greater than any

00:39:12.075 --> 00:39:13.665
other worldly life that we could live.

00:39:13.965 --> 00:39:14.835
So what's stopping?

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:17.910
There's a couple of things that I
just listed out here that you may be

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:21.420
thinking this, you're struggling with
stopping, believing that God is mighty.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.070
The first one may be your faith.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.200
Maybe you're struggling in your faith.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.380
Maybe you've given your life to Christ
and your faith is just struggling.

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:36.030
We all have those moments, so you know,
I have those moments and it's okay.

00:39:36.705 --> 00:39:40.245
But we need to recognize that, that if
we're struggling in our faith, maybe we

00:39:40.245 --> 00:39:45.165
need to do this, maybe we need to pray
and believe, just like the father who went

00:39:45.165 --> 00:39:47.355
to Jesus and said, can you heal my son?

00:39:47.504 --> 00:39:51.254
And you know what Jesus said, do
you believe, and this is what he

00:39:51.254 --> 00:39:55.185
says, I believe, help my unbelief.

00:39:55.365 --> 00:39:58.334
Basically what he's saying is,
I'm struggling in my faith right

00:39:58.334 --> 00:40:00.134
now, but Jesus, can you help me?

00:40:00.915 --> 00:40:05.115
Maybe you need to ask God, God,
help me recognize you as mighty God.

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:07.230
Maybe that's you.

00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:09.270
The next could be fear.

00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:12.209
Maybe you need to cast
all your care on God.

00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:16.890
And remember this, we've studied in
one Timothy, God has not given us a

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:18.990
spirit of fear, but of power and love.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.629
And Son, mine, God has not
given you a spirit of fear.

00:40:21.629 --> 00:40:24.899
So maybe you need to pray and
ask God that maybe it's just not

00:40:24.899 --> 00:40:26.370
understanding and knowing it all.

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:29.129
Does anybody struggle to live
out their faith because you

00:40:29.129 --> 00:40:30.240
feel like you don't know enough?

00:40:31.259 --> 00:40:32.279
Maybe I'm the only person.

00:40:32.285 --> 00:40:32.669
Great.

00:40:32.669 --> 00:40:33.299
Just the pastor's.

00:40:33.299 --> 00:40:34.410
The only one that struggles with this.

00:40:35.085 --> 00:40:39.645
Okay, . Um, if you struggle to live
out your faith because you feel like

00:40:39.645 --> 00:40:42.075
you don't know enough, you never will.

00:40:42.585 --> 00:40:42.795
Okay?

00:40:42.945 --> 00:40:44.835
Can I just free you up right now?

00:40:45.015 --> 00:40:47.715
You will never know enough to
feel like you're just confident

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.735
enough to go share your faith.

00:40:48.735 --> 00:40:49.395
Live out your faith.

00:40:49.395 --> 00:40:50.685
You won't Do you wanna know why?

00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:54.945
Because it, there's so much knowledge to
know about Jesus, but do you know that

00:40:54.945 --> 00:40:57.315
you know enough to live out your faith?

00:40:57.315 --> 00:40:57.735
Absolut.

00:40:58.425 --> 00:41:01.965
If you know why Jesus came, if you
have given your life to Christ and you

00:41:01.965 --> 00:41:06.255
trust him as your savior and one who
can guide your life, you know enough

00:41:06.795 --> 00:41:11.805
because the power of God who is mighty
in, you can do exceedingly, abundantly

00:41:11.805 --> 00:41:12.855
more than you can ask or think.

00:41:13.365 --> 00:41:17.235
So maybe today you need to pray
and you need to say, you know what,

00:41:17.295 --> 00:41:18.735
Lord, I don't need to know it all.

00:41:19.275 --> 00:41:20.865
Maybe I don't need to know everything.

00:41:20.865 --> 00:41:23.235
I think I need to know in
order to live my faith out.

00:41:23.265 --> 00:41:24.615
And obviously it's important to know more.

00:41:25.964 --> 00:41:28.964
Well, here's my challenge as we,
we finish up into invitation here.

00:41:29.355 --> 00:41:31.814
As you're, you're considering those
things and praying and asking the

00:41:31.814 --> 00:41:33.645
Lord, maybe you need to do two things.

00:41:33.645 --> 00:41:38.174
Maybe you need to say yes to Jesus to
be saved and to give your life to Jesus.

00:41:38.955 --> 00:41:41.415
There is no greater day.

00:41:41.985 --> 00:41:43.665
Than today to give your life to Jesus.

00:41:43.995 --> 00:41:45.735
I remember the day that
I gave my life to Jesus.

00:41:45.735 --> 00:41:46.755
It was on a Sunday night.

00:41:46.755 --> 00:41:48.795
There was literally 17
people in the church.

00:41:49.155 --> 00:41:51.705
And I knew I was the only lost
person in the room cuz everybody

00:41:51.705 --> 00:41:52.695
else were the committed people.

00:41:52.695 --> 00:41:53.625
The Sunday night people.

00:41:54.135 --> 00:41:57.465
Um, and I remember my pastor said
this, Hey, uh, if you haven't given

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:00.375
your life to Jesus and you'd like
to do that, you can do that today.

00:42:00.475 --> 00:42:04.529
And, uh, I gave my life to Jesus
with 17 people in the room,

00:42:04.529 --> 00:42:08.009
knowing I was the only last person
because God so transformed my life.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.569
I recognize my needs.

00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:12.660
So I remember my pastor saying that,
you know, today is the day of salvation.

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.029
And he said, you know, there's,
there's never a promise for tomorrow.

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:19.529
And that's not to scare you, but that's
to say an opportunity, stop living the

00:42:19.529 --> 00:42:23.640
Truman life, the life that's fake, the
life that's not real, the life that is

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.710
second best to anything that God could.

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.930
Today.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.350
By giving your life to Jesus, you can
begin to experience the true life,

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:33.140
the true design that God has given
us through relationship with him.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.049
So if that's you today, maybe
you need to give your life to

00:42:36.049 --> 00:42:39.620
Jesus, and if you have questions,
I'm always standing in the back.

00:42:39.625 --> 00:42:40.700
Brittany's always over here.

00:42:40.705 --> 00:42:41.930
I'm here after service.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:44.000
I want to talk to you about
how to give your life to Jesus.

00:42:44.505 --> 00:42:45.165
Maybe it's you.

00:42:45.165 --> 00:42:48.525
You've given your life to Jesus and
you needed to say yes to Jesus again to

00:42:48.525 --> 00:42:50.535
experience him as mighty God in your life.

00:42:50.535 --> 00:42:54.134
You know you can do that, that
every single day you can have

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.275
a new commitment to the Lord.

00:42:55.455 --> 00:42:58.455
And so during this type of invitation,
I just challenge you to, to renew your

00:42:58.455 --> 00:43:01.305
commitment to the Lord or to, to give
your life to Christ in the first way.

00:43:01.305 --> 00:43:04.575
To recognize him as mighty God.

00:43:06.194 --> 00:43:10.275
Guys, don't waste your life
living that second right life.

00:43:10.335 --> 00:43:10.935
There's way.

00:43:11.775 --> 00:43:12.375
For you.

00:43:12.915 --> 00:43:18.285
And so in this season of Christmas, know
that God desires to have you know him in

00:43:18.535 --> 00:43:22.815
a personal way and to experience him as
a wonderful counselor and a mighty God.

00:43:23.115 --> 00:43:23.625
So let's pray.

00:43:23.625 --> 00:43:27.285
Lord Jesus, we pray, uh, that your
word continues to ring truth in

00:43:27.285 --> 00:43:31.775
our lives, Lord, and that we do
not leave, um, without considering

00:43:31.779 --> 00:43:32.745
everything that we've heard today.

00:43:33.615 --> 00:43:37.215
God, I know, um, that you are
working because you are mighty God.

00:43:37.215 --> 00:43:38.055
Lord, I believe in.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:43.050
Uh, that no matter what, Lord, because
your word was open, that we talked about

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:47.040
it, that we discussed it, Lord, that
we, uh, can leave outta here change

00:43:47.045 --> 00:43:54.330
because you are, um, just a God that
works, uh, Lord, in, in amazing ways.

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:56.040
So, go, Lord.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:00.630
I just, um, Lord, as I just, I,
I continue to just think, uh,

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:01.530
of each person in this room.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:02.160
Lord, I.

00:44:03.089 --> 00:44:06.810
Um, everybody in here is, is is in a
different spiritual level, Lord, or

00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:11.100
a different situation, a different,
uh, time and season of their life.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:15.240
And, and God, I just pray that you meet
them where they're at, Lord, if they're

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.549
struggling with sickness, if they're
struggling with the loss, if they're

00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:21.390
struggling with belief and faith, if
they're struggling with finances, um,

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:24.479
Lord, if they're struggling with whatever
it is, Lord, I pray that you meet

00:44:24.479 --> 00:44:27.810
them where they're, Will you minister
their hearts and their lives right

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:32.220
now and, and pour into them, uh, and,
and show them their, your love Lord,

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.470
and to show them how mighty you are.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.399
But God, I also just pray for the
person in this room, Lord, that

00:44:38.399 --> 00:44:42.720
is still considering giving their
lives to you, Lord, may today be

00:44:42.725 --> 00:44:45.839
the day where they put their foot
in the sand and they say, no more.

00:44:45.899 --> 00:44:47.850
No more living that
second rate life, Lord.

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.020
But they give their lives to
you wholeheartedly and fully.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:54.270
So Lord, as.

00:44:55.095 --> 00:44:57.285
Take time to consider and reflect.

00:44:57.285 --> 00:44:59.984
Lord, I pray that all of our
hearts are open, uh, to take

00:44:59.984 --> 00:45:01.185
the next step in our faith.

00:45:01.785 --> 00:45:06.044
And, um, Lord, we thank you for
this time to be able to pray and

00:45:06.049 --> 00:45:08.835
to, to, to be able to worship
and to be able to open your word.

00:45:09.435 --> 00:45:11.085

this near heavenly name.

00:45:11.504 --> 00:45:11.805
Amen.

Amen.
