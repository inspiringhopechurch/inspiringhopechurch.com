00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.420
Um, Hey, so good to see
everybody this morning.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.130
You wanna know one of the things that
I enjoy about living on the east coast?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.670
You guys, aren't looking at your
watches all day to wonder if

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.840
we gotta get home for the game.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.730
I'll get you out in plenty of time.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.320
Plenty of time game started at one.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.430
See, that's the good thing, right?

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.120
Where we used to live in Oklahoma,
the pastor had to preach short

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.320
or people just start walking out.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.100
Right.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.510
So I don't have to do that.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.230
It's good.

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:29.085
It's good.

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:33.585
So, um, super excited today,
um, to finish up our series.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:35.385
So if you've been with us,
if you haven't it's okay.

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:37.215
But we are finishing up our series.

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:40.394
We've been walking through our
mission, our strategy as a church.

00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:44.205
Um, and we took a break the last
two weeks with serve Sunday.

00:00:44.205 --> 00:00:47.405
We had a communion Sunday, but
we're finishing that up today.

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:50.955
And so I'm gonna kind of catch some
of you up on what we talked about.

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:54.795
Uh, but this week we're gonna talk
about expanding God's kingdom and why

00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:56.595
that's part of our strategy and why we.

00:00:57.419 --> 00:01:01.260
That as God's called us to inspire hope by
helping people discover God's purpose for

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.550
the life through relationship with Jesus.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.210
That, that the biggest part of that
is seeing God's kingdom expanded

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.690
to see basically more and more
people come to faith in Christ.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.300
That's one of our biggest
strategies as a church.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.539
And one of the cool parts this morning
is I, we kind of coined this phrase.

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:16.965
Um, to live inspired.

00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:17.145
Right.

00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:19.755
And it seemed like everybody
that was walking in today was

00:01:19.755 --> 00:01:20.655
wearing the live inspired shirt.

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:22.065
And I think most of 'em
may have been serving.

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:25.455
So, uh, that's probably why they
were wearing wearing it, but we used

00:01:25.455 --> 00:01:28.515
the word live inspired because every
day when we wear that shirt, when we

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:33.839
think of that, That, that statement
we think of how can we live today

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:38.070
in a way that inspires other people
to discover a relationship in Jesus.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.429
Right?

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.690
And so as a church where that's just who
we are, and that's why we wanted to talk

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.410
about this, cuz we know, and this is one
of the challenges that, um, who in here

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.169
likes routines, anybody like routines.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.090
Okay, great.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.869
Now I got a question for you
who likes when your routine's

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.580
all messed up, raise your hand.

00:01:57.495 --> 00:01:57.735
Okay.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.305
One of you.

00:01:59.025 --> 00:01:59.565
Good.

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:00.045
Okay.

00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:01.725
You're this doesn't apply to you.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.775
Just close your ears.

00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:03.135
Okay.

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:05.355
Most of us hate our
routines being mixed up.

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:07.465
We like comfort.

00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:09.285
We like consistency.

00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:10.425
We like to sit in the same seats.

00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:11.295
We like to eat the same food.

00:02:11.295 --> 00:02:13.965
We like to go to the same places
we'd like to know what's going on.

00:02:14.475 --> 00:02:17.655
Well, because of that, and this is
what happens in our faith, right?

00:02:17.655 --> 00:02:19.875
In our walks with Christ,
we get comfortable.

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:21.765
We're happy with the
seats in which we sit in.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.615
We're happy with the places in which
we're, you know, we've given my life

00:02:24.615 --> 00:02:26.385
to Christ and I'm living my life in.

00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:27.555
This is good enough.

00:02:27.555 --> 00:02:29.835
This is, this is, this is all
that God's called me to do.

00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:32.834
When we realize is that God's
consistently say this is that we

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:34.394
are supposed to grow in our faith.

00:02:34.394 --> 00:02:38.325
And so very similar because we have a lot
of kids in our church and, and most of us

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:43.035
understand this idea of when your kids are
born, even though for some of your mamas,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.535
want those babies to say babies forever.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.089
Ultimately they're gonna grow up
and they're gonna grow up because

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:52.410
that's, their design is to grow up
and mature, sad, but true mom, sorry.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.980
Sad, but true.

00:02:52.984 --> 00:02:56.730
They grow up and I think of it this way
as a dad, I love seeing my kids grow up

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.209
because it makes me proud to know that
they can feed themselves, that they can

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.480
clothe themselves, that they can take
care of themselves, that they are becoming

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.709
mature in their faith and they're able to
make wise decisions and things like that.

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.910
And so I look at that as awesome.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.929
See, that's what God does.

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:11.869
God looks at us as children of God.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.270
And then he says, Hey, you know,
when we give our lives to Christ,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.830
we're we're babies in Christ, right.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.320
We're infants in Christ
and he wants us to grow up.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.220
And so he celebrates when we, when we
start crawling and when we start walking

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.640
and when we start leaping and when we
start, you know, learning how to do those

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:30.810
things, and that's really what we've been
talking about as a church is how do we.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.690
As a church fulfilled the
mission that God has given us.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.980
Well, we grow up in our faith.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.880
Well, how do we do that?

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.170
We grow in our faith by living in, or
having a relationship with Christ, right?

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.280
So following Jesus, by living in
community with one another, by

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.040
serving those around us and by
ultimately expanding God's kingdom.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.370
And as we do these things,
we mature up in Christ.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.480
That's why we have them.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.530
They're they're easy to remember.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.640
It's and I always tell people this,
go to the Bible and read the Bible.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.140
And if you don't see.

00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:00.585
Where it says to follow Jesus.

00:04:00.885 --> 00:04:04.605
And after Jesus example, if you
don't see where multiple people are

00:04:04.605 --> 00:04:07.485
living in community, and that's how
they, they take care of one another

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.565
and they mature in their faith.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.045
If you go to your Bible and you
see that Jesus served first, and he

00:04:12.045 --> 00:04:17.535
taught us on his way out as he was its
disciples feet to serve other people.

00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:23.555
And if you read your Bible and you see
God's kingdom expanding by multiplying

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.860
disciples, Groups of people and ultimately
churches, you see that all throughout the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.430
Bible, we wanna continue to go to the word
of God, to define who we are as a church.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.260
That's why we have these strategy.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.430
That's why we have a mission.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.670
That's why we're talking about as
a church, because all of us, if we

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.400
don't remember what God's created
us for will stay where we are.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.870
We'll continue to be either one who
doesn't know how to walk or one that

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.220
doesn't know how to clothe ourselves.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.040
And I know that's physically
speaking, but spiritually speaking.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.980
And so that's why we wanted to.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.530
Talk about our strategy and our mission.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.450
And so we're gonna continue that today.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.520
Um, and so with that, knowing
our goal is to take a next step.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.440
That's been the challenge
each and every weekend.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.710
So if you miss one of the messages
that we have had, and you haven't

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.570
been here online on our website,
inspiring hope church.com/watch.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.320
If I'm right on that, I believe,
um, you can go out and find all

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.470
the messages that we preached over
following, living, and serving.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.360
And then you can catch up on this one.

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:27.915
Obviously today, cuz you're here, but
I would love for you to go to do that.

00:05:27.915 --> 00:05:30.735
But think about this small steps when
we're talking about next steps, right?

00:05:31.155 --> 00:05:36.885
Small steps of obedience produce
big results, small steps of

00:05:36.885 --> 00:05:38.745
obedience produce big results.

00:05:38.745 --> 00:05:42.365
And so for some of you, it's
just taking a small step today.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.350
And then a small step tomorrow
and a small step the next day.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.890
And as we do that, we realize that
we begin to mature up in our faith.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.190
Right.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.060
So, um, where we're going to be just
for the first six, we're gonna be kind

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.410
of walking and jumping around today.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.500
So I'm gonna confuse you a little bit,
but we're going to be, um, as I can

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.370
sit here and find it, cuz I didn't
write you down in the right place.

00:06:01.305 --> 00:06:05.145
Hey, there it is John chapter one,
starting in verse 35, John chapter

00:06:05.145 --> 00:06:08.715
one, starting in verse 35, but I
kind of wanna set this up a little

00:06:08.715 --> 00:06:10.125
bit before we jump into the text.

00:06:10.335 --> 00:06:16.275
If we're talking about expanding
God's kingdom, what is God's kingdom?

00:06:16.995 --> 00:06:19.485
We gotta start there because if
we don't know what we're expanding

00:06:19.485 --> 00:06:20.595
or what does that even mean?

00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:22.095
We've gotta define what God's kingdom is.

00:06:22.095 --> 00:06:24.315
And so I, I, a lot of times,
whenever I do this, I just go

00:06:24.315 --> 00:06:26.145
and say, well, what is a kingdom?

00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:26.685
Right?

00:06:26.955 --> 00:06:31.005
Well, a kingdom is a country or a
state or a territory ruled by a king.

00:06:31.005 --> 00:06:33.375
That may be simple to you, but I just
wanna make sure we're on the same page.

00:06:33.375 --> 00:06:37.065
A kingdom is a country, a state,
a territory ruled by king.

00:06:37.065 --> 00:06:40.245
And I would even say in today's
text and this idea of we are a

00:06:40.245 --> 00:06:42.165
people ruled by a king, right?

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.320
King Jesus.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.100
When you think of the word expanding
it's to make larger or more extensive.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.760
So in a practical sense, I wanna, I wanna
lay out what you may ought be thinking.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.640
It's the same thing I'm thinking,
how do we expand God's kingdom?

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.000
If God is ruler over everyone
and everything, I would agree.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.240
That's kind of a little bit confusing,
but let me define a little bit further

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.680
and explain where we're going with.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.550
This is just because God rules
over everyone doesn't mean

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.440
everyone recognizes God as.

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:13.020
So I hope that makes sense.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.669
So ultimately God's kingdom is the
reign of God over the hearts and

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:19.080
lives of those who have trusted him.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.310
See God is obviously in control
and, and ruler over everything.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.370
But ultimately those who have
trusted in him have recognized him

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.270
as a king, the king of our lives,
one who saved us from our sin.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.070
So our mission is to help more
and more people come to know Jesus

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.900
and recognize God as their king.

00:07:36.905 --> 00:07:40.020
And ultimately in doing that
God's kingdom is expand.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:46.620
More and more people begin to follow Jesus
and that group becomes bigger and larger.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.670
And we have a role in that.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:52.110
God's given us the mission to
have a role in that process.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.099
So I hope that makes sense.

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:55.830
When we're talking about expanding
God's kingdom, what that looks

00:07:55.835 --> 00:07:57.270
like, what it is, what it isn't.

00:07:57.275 --> 00:07:58.230
And so I'm gonna say it one more time.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.890
God's kingdom is the reign of
God over the hearts and lives

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.210
of those who have trusted in.

00:08:04.289 --> 00:08:06.060
I wanna give you this
quote by John Calvin.

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:07.200
Here's what he says.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.159
He said, John Calvin said it is
the task of the church to make

00:08:11.159 --> 00:08:13.020
the invisible kingdom visible.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.800
Well, the kingdom of God is
invisible to most around us.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.969
They don't know who Jesus is.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.480
They don't know that God is
the king over their lives.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.340
And so, because we do know this, we are
to make the invisible kingdom visible.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.360
And here's what he says.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.010
He says, we do that by living.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:34.409
In such a way that we bear witness
to the reality of his kingship in our

00:08:34.415 --> 00:08:36.990
jobs, in our families, in our schools.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.040
And he says, even in our checkbooks,
he says, because God is in CRI

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.250
in Christ is king over every one
of these spirits of our lives.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.620
So the only way the kingdom of God is
going to be displayed in this world

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.090
before Christ comes as if we display
it, by the way we live as citizens

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.190
of heaven and subjects of the king.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:57.930
So.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.170
Why is expanding God's kingdom.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.770
One of the last things we talk about guys
is because we ultimately know every one

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:11.460
of us, every one of us is part of helping
other people discover a hope in Jesus.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.780
Every one of us plays that role.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.740
And if we don't realize that we'll,
we'll miss something and we're

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.880
gonna continue to expand on that.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.690
And I don't wanna keep jumping too
much further, but, um, I want us

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.930
to, to just jump into this today,
this text and begin to kind of.

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:28.485
What the Bible has to say
about these different areas.

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:31.275
When we talk about expanding God's
kingdom by multiplying disciples,

00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:33.495
groups and churches around the world.

00:09:33.825 --> 00:09:36.045
So Jesus' focus first on
multiplying disciples.

00:09:36.045 --> 00:09:38.025
And this is what we're gonna
read here again in John chapter

00:09:38.025 --> 00:09:40.245
one versus 35 through 49.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.965
So I'm gonna read it here.

00:09:40.965 --> 00:09:45.195
It says the next day John was standing
with two of his disciples, and this

00:09:45.195 --> 00:09:46.455
is speaking of John the Baptist.

00:09:47.535 --> 00:09:49.575
This is when he saw Jesus passing by.

00:09:49.575 --> 00:09:51.765
He said, look, the lame of God.

00:09:52.695 --> 00:09:55.875
The two disciples, heard him
say this and followed him.

00:09:56.265 --> 00:09:59.715
And when Jesus turned to notice
them following him, he asked them

00:09:59.955 --> 00:10:01.965
why or what are you looking for?

00:10:02.505 --> 00:10:07.635
And they said to him, rabbi, which means
teacher, where are you staying come?

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.685
And you'll see, he replied.

00:10:08.955 --> 00:10:12.315
So they went and saw where he was staying
and they stayed with him that day.

00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:13.815
And it was about four in the, a.

00:10:14.985 --> 00:10:19.695
Andrew Simon Peter's brother was one of
the two who heard John following him.

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:23.715
And he first found his own brother
Simon and told him we have found the

00:10:23.715 --> 00:10:25.425
Messiah, which is translated Christ.

00:10:25.755 --> 00:10:27.315
And he brought Simon to Jesus.

00:10:27.315 --> 00:10:30.075
And when Jesus saw him, he
said, you are Simon son of John.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:32.715
You'll be called CFAs,
which is translated Peter.

00:10:33.405 --> 00:10:37.455
And the next day, Jesus decided
to leave for Galilee and he found

00:10:37.455 --> 00:10:39.705
Philip and he told him to follow.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.420
Now Philip was from beta in the hometown
of Andrew, Peter and Philip found

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.680
Nathaniel and told him we have found
the one Moses wrote about in the law.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.900
And so did the prophets, Jesus, the son
of Joseph from Nazareth can anything good.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.710
Come out of Nazareth.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.620
Nathaniel asked, come
and see Philip answered.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.620
And then Jesus saw Nathaniel
coming towards him and said,

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.090
here truly is an Israeli.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.360
And whom there is no DEC.

00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:05.895
How do you know me?

00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:09.465
Nathaniel asked before Philip called
you when you were under the victory.

00:11:09.465 --> 00:11:10.125
I saw you.

00:11:10.125 --> 00:11:10.905
Jesus answered.

00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:13.455
So we're gonna stop right there.

00:11:14.295 --> 00:11:15.615
Oh, actually I think it's first 40.

00:11:15.615 --> 00:11:18.645
So rabbi Nathaniel replied,
you are the son of God.

00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:20.445
You are the king of Israel.

00:11:20.835 --> 00:11:22.485
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:11:23.025 --> 00:11:24.315
We're so thankful Lord for you.

00:11:24.315 --> 00:11:25.845
And we're so thankful that every single.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.280
Um, that we have the opportunity to
have a personal relationship with you.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.290
Lord, we get to grow in our faith.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.690
We get to know you more and you
get to work in and through our

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.130
lives Lord, as we surrender to you.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.390
So today I, I pray that as we jump into
your word, as we begin to think about what

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.500
it looks like to, to multiply disciples
and groups and, and churches and Lord,

00:11:43.505 --> 00:11:47.790
why that is part of, of your story and
why that's part of, uh, the church's

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.300
history and the church's future Lord,
I pray that all of our hearts are open

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.420
Lord to our role and our part of it.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.880
Um, and so Lord, just pray that
our hearts and our minds are open

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.530
to whatever you wanna speak to us.

00:11:58.589 --> 00:11:59.819
And so we pray this in your heaven name.

00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:00.689
Amen.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.470
So the first thing that we're
gonna look at here is how Jesus

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.060
focused on multiplying disciples.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.880
And you're gonna kind of see
one things I love about Jesus is

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.830
he's nonchalant about it, right?

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.180
He goes about his business.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.760
He does his thing, but it seems
that the more and more that people

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.940
spend time around him, the more and
more they begin to reflect Christ.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.680
And we're gonna see that
specifically in this.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:24.990
And so Jesus, as we see in this
story story, right, John, the Baptist

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.790
asked, you know, Hey, this is Jesus.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.290
And those two disciples followed Jesus.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.479
And Jesus said, okay, well, you
know, Come and follow me basically.

00:12:31.479 --> 00:12:33.010
And well, then we see
this with Philip as well.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.339
And so Jesus had the ability
because he's God, right?

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:40.060
Son of God, that he could have just
went and found every single person in

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.800
the world and, and told him who he was.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.319
And they could have given their
lives to Christ one person.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:44.800
Right.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.969
But Jesus and speaking of really,
even God's plan was God's design

00:12:48.969 --> 00:12:52.030
was that everyone was a part of.

00:12:52.485 --> 00:12:55.455
Helping people know, know Jesus, right?

00:12:55.455 --> 00:12:56.745
And so we see this in the story.

00:12:56.745 --> 00:12:59.235
And so it started first with John
and we're gonna see this in verses

00:12:59.235 --> 00:13:04.905
35 through 37, where John was the
first one to recognize Jesus point

00:13:04.905 --> 00:13:08.655
out to his disciples who Jesus
was and they begin to follow him.

00:13:08.775 --> 00:13:09.195
Right.

00:13:09.195 --> 00:13:15.195
Well then as they followed Jesus,
they were impacted so much that we

00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:19.125
see that Andrew, one of the disciples
that begin to follow Jesus,  was so

00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:21.735
impacted by the time that he spent
with Jesus, that he found his brother

00:13:21.735 --> 00:13:24.015
Peter, and he says, come follow Jesus.

00:13:24.015 --> 00:13:25.605
He says, come meet Jesus.

00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:30.615
And obviously as Jesus meets them,
Peter begins to say, oh, okay.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.505
Yeah, I, I wanna follow you as well.

00:13:33.195 --> 00:13:36.975
And so just even with this story
specifically, right, we see Jesus

00:13:37.395 --> 00:13:38.835
is the one that reached Andrew.

00:13:39.405 --> 00:13:43.095
And Andrew's the one that reached
Peter and Peter, if you look at

00:13:43.095 --> 00:13:45.885
the story and again, if you study
your Bible, you'll know this Peter.

00:13:46.515 --> 00:13:48.795
was the rock that the church was built on.

00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:51.944
We see this in the book of acts where
Peter was such an important person.

00:13:52.275 --> 00:13:56.055
And I always ask these questions
when I read God's word, what if

00:13:56.805 --> 00:13:58.035
Andrew didn't go find his brother?

00:13:58.035 --> 00:13:58.395
Peter?

00:13:59.085 --> 00:14:03.645
What if Andrew said, you know, all I
cared about was me following Jesus.

00:14:03.915 --> 00:14:07.355
I found him I'm gonna hang out with him
and I'm gonna stay right where I am.

00:14:07.355 --> 00:14:07.995
Cuz it's comfort.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.360
I mean, this is fun.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.110
This is Jesus.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.620
I don't wanna leave his presence,
but no, he, he started thinking,

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.160
man, I have somebody that,
that should know who Jesus is.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.720
I I'm gonna go find him.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.290
And that's Peter.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:19.710
Right?

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.610
So he went and found Peter and Peter
becomes this person who is again,

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.530
an important figure in the Bible.

00:14:26.745 --> 00:14:31.275
I, I, I think so often at times when
we look at stories like this, when it

00:14:31.275 --> 00:14:35.775
comes to all of us going and reaching
someone, we don't realize the impact

00:14:36.255 --> 00:14:37.995
of inviting one person to come follow.

00:14:37.995 --> 00:14:40.155
Jesus can do in this story.

00:14:40.215 --> 00:14:43.125
It was a huge part,
Peter, the rock, right?

00:14:43.125 --> 00:14:46.635
The one who the church
was started with an acts.

00:14:47.445 --> 00:14:50.535
And I, I think back to
this guys, I am the result.

00:14:50.925 --> 00:14:52.065
Of a friend in Oklahoma.

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.935
I'm the result of, I went to
college and I, I really didn't care

00:14:55.935 --> 00:14:57.345
much about church at that point.

00:14:57.555 --> 00:15:00.045
And, uh, we were getting
ready to have our first child.

00:15:00.255 --> 00:15:02.715
And I remember Brittany telling
me, we need to get this whole

00:15:02.715 --> 00:15:03.615
church thing figured out.

00:15:03.735 --> 00:15:04.665
We need to figure out what we're doing.

00:15:04.665 --> 00:15:05.835
I'm like, okay, I guess so.

00:15:05.865 --> 00:15:09.495
Well, my friend Scott, he spent a
whole year with me cuz we had all the

00:15:09.495 --> 00:15:12.975
same classes and he kept inviting me
to a church called Crescent valley.

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:15.525
And the one things I noticed
about Scott was different.

00:15:15.795 --> 00:15:17.775
He just wanted to be my friend,
whether I went to church or.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.680
He cared about me.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.320
He told me truths, but he didn't judge me.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.150
He just was present in my life.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.340
And so it connected.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.380
My wife said, Hey, when you get
this church thing figured out,

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.370
Scott said, come to church.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.500
Well, this church was 40
minutes away from our home.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.150
I guess we'll go to this one.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.620
So we started attending a church.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.290
We spent a year there getting to know
the church, getting to know Christ and,

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.550
and learning what Christ had done for us.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.920
Getting to know Scott's family.

00:15:44.325 --> 00:15:47.655
I gave my life to Christ a year
later and begin to follow Jesus.

00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:52.485
And I begin to think back Scott,
this guy that was in my college class

00:15:52.965 --> 00:15:58.155
because he consistently invited me cuz
I am here in Ohio planting a church.

00:15:58.605 --> 00:16:01.785
Now what like was that all
Scott's responsibility?

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.675
Was there other people that invested
in me and helped me to that point?

00:16:03.675 --> 00:16:05.925
But I think of Scott because
Scott was the one that invited me.

00:16:06.525 --> 00:16:09.495
He was the one that invested me
to, to even come to know Jesus.

00:16:09.945 --> 00:16:13.635
And I, I just think
Peter was the same way.

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:18.945
And many of us, if, if we think
about it in our daily lives, what

00:16:18.945 --> 00:16:20.445
about the person at your job?

00:16:20.445 --> 00:16:22.875
What if you invited them to come to Jesus?

00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:26.205
What if they were the next person
who reached the next person who

00:16:26.205 --> 00:16:28.995
reached the next person that
started churches around the world?

00:16:28.995 --> 00:16:31.065
I don't know what it is, but it doesn't
matter if they start churches around

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.255
the world or whether they follow Jesus.

00:16:32.885 --> 00:16:34.525
What if you're that story?

00:16:35.505 --> 00:16:37.335
I've seen people in my life
that's been that story.

00:16:37.335 --> 00:16:38.505
And so that stuck out to me, right?

00:16:38.505 --> 00:16:42.465
That that not only Jesus was reaching
people, but the people Jesus was

00:16:42.465 --> 00:16:43.665
reaching was reaching people.

00:16:44.025 --> 00:16:46.335
So now let's look at verses
43 through 49, right?

00:16:46.335 --> 00:16:50.835
Jesus reaches Philip and after
Philip began to follow Jesus, he

00:16:50.835 --> 00:16:53.385
says, you know what, I'm gonna go
find Nathaniel, I'm gonna go find

00:16:53.385 --> 00:16:55.095
Nathaniel, bring him to Jesus.

00:16:55.095 --> 00:16:57.465
And obviously Jesus shares
with this story with him.

00:16:57.465 --> 00:16:59.175
And Philip begins to follow Jesus.

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:04.245
So I wanna kind of summarize this from
the beginning Jesus model to build gods

00:17:04.245 --> 00:17:08.025
kingdom was not just Jesus reaching
people and finding every one of them.

00:17:08.175 --> 00:17:10.665
It was, he would reach people and
you would see the people that he

00:17:10.665 --> 00:17:12.075
reached, go reach other people.

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:14.954
So I, I, if you guys are cool
with this, we're gonna, we're

00:17:14.954 --> 00:17:17.415
gonna do a little bit of teamwork.

00:17:17.444 --> 00:17:19.725
If you guys are fine, moving around
a little bit, some of you, I won't

00:17:19.905 --> 00:17:22.335
make y'all participate, but if some
of you'll participate with me, I'd

00:17:22.335 --> 00:17:23.505
love for you to participate with me.

00:17:23.895 --> 00:17:25.125
I wanna give an example here.

00:17:25.605 --> 00:17:27.345
So if I.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.930
Just wanted to be one person
just like Jesus was right.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:34.050
And just think about
this and go reach people.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.139
I, I, I'm gonna be pretty slow at
it, but I'm gonna do this, Joe,

00:17:37.379 --> 00:17:39.450
because I know you're okay with this,
Joe, why don't you come up here?

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.750
Because you know, I love Joe and
Joe don't even get afraid of me.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.399
So good news.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.040
I reached Joe over here,
told Joe about Jesus.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:47.850
Joe's fallen.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:48.780
Jesus is great.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.210
Hey Joe, why don't you just hang out here.

00:17:51.899 --> 00:17:52.950
Just keep following Jesus.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.110
You just hang out here and I'm
gonna go reach somebody else.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.580
Hey Brian, come here, Brian.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:56.820
Come here.

00:17:57.419 --> 00:17:58.770
Hey, man, man.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:59.220
That's awesome.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.570
See, Brian just gave his a lot to Jesus.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.169
This is awesome.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.970
Hey, you hang out here with Joe.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.290
You guys stay there.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:04.350
Yeah.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.639
You just came hanging out.

00:18:05.639 --> 00:18:06.960
I'm I'm gonna go out again.

00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:09.840
Well, you guys see this, like if
I was to do this, we might spend

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.919
the rest of my message, me going
back and forth, back and forth.

00:18:14.879 --> 00:18:17.010
But now let's just
think about this, Brian.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.419
We're gonna act like you
didn't come up here yet.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.480
I came and reached Joe
and I said, Hey, Joe, man.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.830
So glad you gave your life to Jesus.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.840
Let's go out and reach some more people.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.720
Okay, well, my next guy's
Brian, who's your next person.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.090
All right, man.

00:18:33.095 --> 00:18:40.680
This is awesome now because
I chose to lead Joe to Jesus.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.210
We both went out together because
Jesus changed our life so much and,

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.740
and we went reached two more people.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.450
Well, Hey guys, we reach.

00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:50.715
We can reach a lot more people.

00:18:50.715 --> 00:18:53.355
If we work together, let's go get,
let's go get four more people.

00:18:53.415 --> 00:18:54.405
Let's go get four people.

00:18:54.525 --> 00:18:55.395
Let's go get four people.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:56.925
Hey Riley, why don't you come up here?

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:58.455
I want you to know Jesus.

00:18:59.235 --> 00:18:59.685
Okay,

00:19:05.655 --> 00:19:05.925
man.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:06.605
Look at this.

00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:08.504
This is crazy.

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:08.985
Oh, look at it.

00:19:08.985 --> 00:19:10.514
See, Ryan's going to get three.

00:19:11.264 --> 00:19:14.685
See, now, now some's happening.

00:19:15.165 --> 00:19:17.115
See, he said, why did
you set the bar so low?

00:19:18.105 --> 00:19:19.695
That's really what Ryan's saying here.

00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:20.115
Okay.

00:19:21.014 --> 00:19:22.754
See, I actually didn't set the tone.

00:19:22.754 --> 00:19:22.935
Right?

00:19:22.935 --> 00:19:25.095
I was just getting one guys, look at this.

00:19:25.095 --> 00:19:29.774
I just wanna tell you there's a difference
between addition and multiplication.

00:19:30.805 --> 00:19:34.514
Addition's a lot slower, even
though it's a lot easier for me, but

00:19:34.514 --> 00:19:36.975
multiplication reaches a lot more people.

00:19:38.205 --> 00:19:38.955
So you guys can go sit down.

00:19:38.955 --> 00:19:39.795
We're gonna continue to talk about it.

00:19:39.795 --> 00:19:40.635
Thank you guys for parti.

00:19:42.285 --> 00:19:43.425
Think about this.

00:19:43.965 --> 00:19:47.925
Jesus has always been about multiplication
because if it was always about addition,

00:19:48.165 --> 00:19:51.585
Jesus, would've never left this earth,
even though I know it took his sacrifice

00:19:51.585 --> 00:19:54.855
to pay for our sins, but Jesus, would've
never left this earth because it was all

00:19:54.855 --> 00:19:57.465
about him walking and going to get people.

00:19:57.465 --> 00:20:03.885
But it wasn't his plan God's plan all
along was to send us on Jesus to model.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.080
What it was like to reach people,
tell them about the gospel and the

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.430
hope of grace and mercy and peace
and forgiveness and all these things

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:12.810
that the relationship that God wants.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.030
Jesus was modeling that.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.770
And the people that he reached
caught the caught the mission, got

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:24.390
the vision, and they begin to invite
people and they begin to invite people.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.720
And here's the cool part because
they were committed to doing that.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.770
We are all here today because
of their commitment to not

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:32.940
just leave it up to one person.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.770
But again, I I'm telling you
it's easy and a room full of

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.379
people to say, you know what?

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.040
I'm just gonna let them do the addition.

00:20:44.459 --> 00:20:46.740
It's uncomfortable to be a
part of the multiplication.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.810
That's what I was talking
about in the beginning.

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:52.050
I, I really, I'm not wanting
to step on your toes to be rude

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.310
because that's not who I am.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:54.750
I'm wanting you to see this.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:21:00.510
If God, if God has so changed your life,
you wanna be a part of multiplication.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.639
That's the cool part.

00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:06.375
Like when I talk with Joe and Kristen,
a lot of times we haven't been meeting

00:21:06.375 --> 00:21:10.155
online when we used to meet once a
once a week online on zoom, we got to

00:21:10.155 --> 00:21:12.975
talking after they give their lives
to Christ and they begin to think of

00:21:12.975 --> 00:21:15.585
people in their life and they would just
begin to start conversations at work

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.745
or, and, and talk to them about Jesus.

00:21:17.745 --> 00:21:21.525
And, you know, I think you have had one
friend come Kristen, which is great.

00:21:21.855 --> 00:21:23.985
And you know, all the conversations
you had, you would've wished

00:21:23.985 --> 00:21:26.955
everybody would've came, but they
didn't, but you were intentional

00:21:26.955 --> 00:21:28.215
to be a part of multiplication.

00:21:28.755 --> 00:21:30.615
And that person may not be here
today, but I know that they've

00:21:30.615 --> 00:21:32.145
been impacted by you and by the.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.050
So I just think about that.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:34.260
Right?

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:39.870
All of us have the ability to be a part
of God's plan of multiplying disciples.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.730
Good news.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.430
That's why as a church, we will focus.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.590
We will dedicate ourselves
to multiplying disciples.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.920
It's not just about me and
it's not just about you.

00:21:49.925 --> 00:21:54.000
It's all of us reaching people for Christ.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:54.960
And here's the cool part.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.400
And I kind of mentioned
this just as kind of.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:58.050
A reminder.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.910
Yes, Jesus came to this earth to
model what it was like to follow him

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.760
and to, to live a life that followed
God and to surrender ourselves

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.140
and to be forgiven of our sins.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.420
And he went to the cross
and he died for us.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.570
And when he died for us, his
sacrifice paid for our sins.

00:22:12.575 --> 00:22:12.700
Right.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.360
But I think about this,
Jesus also had a bigger plan.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.960
And again, I say, Jesus, God had a bigger
plan because he talks about in John 16,

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.440
seven, whenever he is talking about that,
he's gonna leave and he's gonna go away.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.290
And he says this, nevertheless,
I'm telling you the truth.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:26.940
He's speaking to the, uh, disciples.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.220
It is for your benefit that I go away.

00:22:29.225 --> 00:22:32.670
Because if I do not go away, the
counselor will not come to you.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.860
And if I go, I will send him to you.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.690
So by Jesus.

00:22:37.785 --> 00:22:40.335
Choosing right to sacrifice his life.

00:22:40.635 --> 00:22:42.045
He actually gave us something better.

00:22:42.045 --> 00:22:43.185
And this is the coolest part.

00:22:43.455 --> 00:22:49.095
Did you know that Jesus is with you
every day because the spirit of God that

00:22:49.095 --> 00:22:53.535
lives inside of you at the Mona salvation
is God's presence with you every day.

00:22:53.805 --> 00:22:55.005
So you always wonder, man.

00:22:55.005 --> 00:22:59.025
I wish Jesus was going with me to
go witness to somebody is the, the

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.245
spirit of God is with this every day.

00:23:01.755 --> 00:23:02.475
To guide us.

00:23:02.595 --> 00:23:06.405
And so his great missional plan was to
send the spirit of God inside of each

00:23:06.405 --> 00:23:10.305
one of us so that we would have the power
of God, the confidence, the spirit of

00:23:10.305 --> 00:23:12.945
God to go and help reach other people.

00:23:12.945 --> 00:23:14.055
I think that's so cool.

00:23:14.325 --> 00:23:14.565
Right.

00:23:14.565 --> 00:23:15.525
God's plan with this.

00:23:16.035 --> 00:23:18.315
So he knew the greatest way to
expand God's kingdom was to send

00:23:18.315 --> 00:23:22.425
the spirit directly into our
hearts to go everywhere with this.

00:23:22.455 --> 00:23:24.165
But here's the cool part
we're gonna continue on.

00:23:24.165 --> 00:23:24.345
Right.

00:23:24.345 --> 00:23:28.635
So we talked about Jesus focused on
multiplying disciples, but he also

00:23:28.635 --> 00:23:30.135
focused on multiplying groups and you'll.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.649
Hang with me here, because this, this
part of it, I'm gonna reference a lot

00:23:34.649 --> 00:23:36.750
of scripture, cuz we would have to
take a time, a ton of time to kind

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:37.649
of read through every part of it.

00:23:37.649 --> 00:23:40.379
But I'm gonna reference scripture
here, but Jesus spent most of

00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:41.790
the time with his 12 disciples.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:45.149
So most of you may know this, this
text where Jesus goes up on a mountain.

00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:48.659
He prays, he had all these people
following him and he chooses 12.

00:23:49.034 --> 00:23:49.665
To follow him.

00:23:49.995 --> 00:23:53.865
So Jesus spent a lot of his
time with a group of people.

00:23:53.865 --> 00:23:55.274
He said that is important.

00:23:55.635 --> 00:23:59.054
And I always tell people this, if Jesus
taken 12, I don't know if I can take more

00:23:59.054 --> 00:24:02.655
than a couple, but even if you look at
Jesus's life, Jesus spent a lot of time

00:24:02.655 --> 00:24:04.455
with three James, Peter, James and John.

00:24:05.084 --> 00:24:07.514
So there's another group that
he had within his 12, right.

00:24:07.514 --> 00:24:08.504
That he spent time with.

00:24:08.925 --> 00:24:12.165
Then we see in Luke 10 where he
sent a group of 72 disciples out

00:24:12.165 --> 00:24:13.574
to minister and spread the gospel.

00:24:13.965 --> 00:24:15.455
So there's another group of people.

00:24:16.004 --> 00:24:18.735
And then we see again, this is why I'm
referencing different, different things.

00:24:18.735 --> 00:24:20.025
You can go out and look at it yourself.

00:24:20.445 --> 00:24:24.045
Um, after Jesus told his disciples to
wait for the holy spirit, and this is

00:24:24.045 --> 00:24:29.415
in acts one, they went into an upper
room and there was about 120 listed

00:24:29.415 --> 00:24:31.125
there in acts one that was in that.

00:24:31.125 --> 00:24:32.085
So there's another group.

00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:36.389
But here's the, even the picture is the
spirit of God's what guided these people

00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:37.980
in the beginning of, of the church.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.709
And I tell you, I go into the
word of God and I say, Hey, how

00:24:40.709 --> 00:24:41.820
did they live their faith out?

00:24:41.879 --> 00:24:43.110
What did they prioritize?

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.129
Well in the book of acts after
Pentecost, which is whenever Peter

00:24:47.129 --> 00:24:49.679
began to share the gospel and three,
th some people gave their lives

00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:51.510
to Christ and acts chapter two.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:56.159
You're gonna see this where they begin to
obviously listen to the apostles teaching.

00:24:56.159 --> 00:24:58.290
And if you were here during the
time that we talked about living in

00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.280
community, we would've heard this.

00:25:00.345 --> 00:25:03.554
But they begin to listen to the
apostles teaching, but they begin

00:25:03.554 --> 00:25:05.415
to break bread from home to home.

00:25:05.475 --> 00:25:09.645
And as they broke bread from home
to home and celebrated one another

00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:12.945
and built one another up, it says
that the Lord added to them daily.

00:25:13.814 --> 00:25:15.405
And these were groups of people.

00:25:15.524 --> 00:25:21.375
So the church was founded on groups of
people and prioritizing groups of people.

00:25:22.995 --> 00:25:24.165
I want you to think about this.

00:25:24.195 --> 00:25:27.254
Why is it important to spend
time in groups of people anybody

00:25:27.254 --> 00:25:28.425
ever been in tug war match?

00:25:29.355 --> 00:25:32.235
Any better been on the wrong
side of it, which means you have

00:25:32.235 --> 00:25:33.225
nobody that knows how to pull.

00:25:33.225 --> 00:25:35.145
And it feels like you're pulling
the rope all on your own.

00:25:35.475 --> 00:25:36.675
You end up getting pulled in the mud.

00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:38.295
See, here's the thing you got.

00:25:38.295 --> 00:25:39.135
You girls know this.

00:25:39.135 --> 00:25:40.125
I hope this sticks with you.

00:25:40.125 --> 00:25:40.545
Okay.

00:25:42.025 --> 00:25:46.665
If, if we spend time as individuals
in a relationship with Christ, that's

00:25:46.665 --> 00:25:48.825
great, but we are better together.

00:25:48.825 --> 00:25:50.145
Just like in a tug of war match.

00:25:50.325 --> 00:25:52.965
If you only have one side of the rope
and you have 10 people on the other

00:25:52.965 --> 00:25:54.735
side, you're gonna lose every time.

00:25:55.635 --> 00:25:56.925
Guys designed these groups.

00:25:56.925 --> 00:25:58.455
That's why I love this about axis.

00:25:58.515 --> 00:25:59.055
Immediately.

00:25:59.055 --> 00:26:01.545
After 3000 were saved, they
didn't just spend time.

00:26:01.545 --> 00:26:04.785
In the 3000, they spent time
in each other's homes, in

00:26:04.785 --> 00:26:05.865
smaller groups of people.

00:26:06.135 --> 00:26:07.725
So the church was founded on that.

00:26:08.115 --> 00:26:10.305
Obviously Jesus prioritized
that in his ministry.

00:26:10.635 --> 00:26:11.805
And I want you to see this.

00:26:11.955 --> 00:26:13.035
Why is a church?

00:26:13.245 --> 00:26:14.205
Do we prioritize this?

00:26:14.774 --> 00:26:15.794
Because we've seen it work.

00:26:15.885 --> 00:26:17.145
So let me give you a great example.

00:26:17.145 --> 00:26:19.514
So you guys can see this
story at inspiring hope.

00:26:19.544 --> 00:26:22.544
Our family moved here,
one family, six people.

00:26:22.635 --> 00:26:24.405
We started a group in our home, right.

00:26:24.584 --> 00:26:25.215
Six people.

00:26:25.215 --> 00:26:26.385
And we started addition.

00:26:26.715 --> 00:26:29.504
We started inviting people
in inviting people in.

00:26:29.504 --> 00:26:31.084
So one at a time here was the cool part.

00:26:32.145 --> 00:26:34.455
One of the greatest things that I
loved is after we started inviting

00:26:34.455 --> 00:26:37.755
people in like Lauren Orville, I think
Lauren Orville brought in like the

00:26:37.755 --> 00:26:39.525
other half, like, what did they do?

00:26:39.525 --> 00:26:40.305
They started multiplying.

00:26:40.305 --> 00:26:42.555
They started inviting the Yoders
and they started inviting the buyers

00:26:42.555 --> 00:26:43.485
and then they started inviting.

00:26:43.695 --> 00:26:47.565
And then I've seen this happen where
a lot of you are here for the fact

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:49.215
of somebody else invited you in.

00:26:49.515 --> 00:26:51.075
So then we started seeing multiplication.

00:26:51.075 --> 00:26:53.775
We went from addition to
multiplication where our house got

00:26:53.775 --> 00:26:56.175
full and yes, we started a service.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.740
A church, big church where
we are right here, right.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.360
With a whole group of people.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.590
But then we said, you know what?

00:27:01.595 --> 00:27:02.850
That group in our home's too big.

00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:04.290
We need another group.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.920
So we started a group in Middletown
and we saw a family out of our

00:27:07.925 --> 00:27:09.870
group, go start a group and take
a couple families with them.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.080
And, and they've reached some new people
from their neighborhood, which is amazing.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.780
And then our group grew
and we added more people.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.350
And we started seeing in those
groups where the Lord added

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.330
people to their group daily.

00:27:22.185 --> 00:27:25.995
So when I think about God's word, I
say this, what does God's word say?

00:27:26.115 --> 00:27:27.254
How do they live out their faith?

00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:29.475
We should mimic it when we mimic it.

00:27:29.534 --> 00:27:32.565
We should see if God, uh, God
works through those same things.

00:27:32.565 --> 00:27:34.215
And he does, and we've
seen it in our church.

00:27:34.544 --> 00:27:38.685
So if, if you see something that
works, you should continue to follow

00:27:38.685 --> 00:27:40.965
after, especially when we're talking
about the word of God and that's

00:27:40.965 --> 00:27:41.804
what we're gonna continue to do.

00:27:41.804 --> 00:27:43.304
So we're starting another.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.160
so this will be our third group
that we're multiplying, right?

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.430
Because we believe that we're
better able to reach more people

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.080
through multiplying groups, right?

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.330
Multiplying disciples, which
we're continuing to try to do.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.910
Because one of the things I love
is there's people that are in

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.460
here that have been a part ofop
ship groups that are starting new

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.650
ones, which that is great as well.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.600
So I say all this, right?

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.360
That it's so important that
we focus on multiplication.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.240
But let me tell you that I wanna, I
wanna talk about this briefly, cuz I,

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.260
I, I started thinking about this, this.

00:28:11.399 --> 00:28:13.830
You wanna know why we don't
typically multiply groups?

00:28:15.419 --> 00:28:18.540
Anybody you gotta uncomfortable.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.530
Why is it uncomfortable?

00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:24.659
I knew you'd have the answer to this.

00:28:24.659 --> 00:28:28.560
One of the hardest things was, is the,
the Bens and Yoders were the ones that

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.209
had went out to go start this other group.

00:28:30.629 --> 00:28:32.310
And we started seeing each other less.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.149
That was tough.

00:28:34.245 --> 00:28:36.975
That's really tough because you love
those people and yeah, you could choose

00:28:36.975 --> 00:28:39.375
another time to meet with them, but,
you know, we're, we're all families.

00:28:39.375 --> 00:28:40.275
We have everything going on.

00:28:40.275 --> 00:28:44.445
And so it's tough to say that
that's good, but you know how

00:28:44.445 --> 00:28:45.765
we realized that it was good.

00:28:46.515 --> 00:28:48.555
When I started hearing that their
neighbors were coming to their group.

00:28:49.755 --> 00:28:53.295
When, when I started seeing other people
coming to our group and I started going,

00:28:53.295 --> 00:28:56.685
this is why it's hard, it's difficult.

00:28:57.015 --> 00:28:58.245
It's uncomfortable.

00:28:58.695 --> 00:29:03.495
So rather than choosing comfort, In ease
of just, let's just huddle together.

00:29:03.495 --> 00:29:08.325
In this one group, we chose
uncomfortable, difficult, and God

00:29:08.325 --> 00:29:09.315
is doing something through it.

00:29:09.345 --> 00:29:11.055
And that's why we'll
continue to choose it.

00:29:11.505 --> 00:29:15.615
Even though it's hard because here's
the thing, guys, and this is truth.

00:29:16.455 --> 00:29:20.265
It's not about building our kingdom, our
comfort it's about building God's kingdom

00:29:20.265 --> 00:29:23.865
because God has changed their life so much
that we want other people to experience.

00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:24.165
God's.

00:29:25.065 --> 00:29:27.255
So I think that's important
for us to think through that.

00:29:27.255 --> 00:29:27.555
Right?

00:29:27.975 --> 00:29:31.725
The last one I want you to see here is
Jesus focused on multiplying churches.

00:29:31.905 --> 00:29:35.145
And we see this mostly, obviously
in the new Testament, right?

00:29:35.385 --> 00:29:41.415
Acts one eight says this, and this is
where Jesus's last words to his disciples

00:29:41.475 --> 00:29:44.625
was this, but you'll receive power
when the holy spirit has come on you.

00:29:44.775 --> 00:29:49.455
And you'll be my witnesses in Jerusalem,
Judea Samaria, and to the ends of the.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.720
So Jesus' plan was to see God's words,
spread, spread all over the whole world.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:59.490
And that's our desire as well, not just
in Hamilton, but around the whole world.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:03.929
And as we continue to grow as a church,
we're gonna continue to, to push outside

00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:07.529
of Hamilton and outside of Cincinnati
and outside of the United States.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.790
And here's the cool part.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.429
Cincinnati is actually kind of a
melting pot of different cultures.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.325
And that's why if you were here
during serve Sunday, We actually

00:30:14.325 --> 00:30:15.765
support an Arabic church planner.

00:30:15.885 --> 00:30:18.615
Who's reaching somebody of
a different culture outside,

00:30:18.615 --> 00:30:20.115
different worlds, different nations.

00:30:20.115 --> 00:30:20.505
Right.

00:30:20.805 --> 00:30:24.285
And so I love that because we're
focused on the same single thing.

00:30:24.285 --> 00:30:29.235
So how do we know that God's plan
Jesus plan was to multiply churches?

00:30:30.045 --> 00:30:34.635
Well, here's what we see again, let's
go to the Bible acts book of act, right?

00:30:34.935 --> 00:30:37.155
The spirit of God came
into the disciples lives.

00:30:37.605 --> 00:30:39.555
And until later we see Paul's life.

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.990
And they began to start churches
in Jerusalem, Judas Samaria

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.770
into the ends of the earth.

00:30:44.129 --> 00:30:48.060
See Paul's letters were to
churches in these areas.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.540
He would pin these letters to
the church, you know, in Philippi

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.709
or to the church in Galatia.

00:30:52.709 --> 00:30:53.159
Right.

00:30:53.429 --> 00:30:57.830
And we see that he wrote to these churches
and he even appointed leaders, Timothy,

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.919
and Titu over some of those churches to
set up leadership like eldership, if you

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:06.149
see, or deacons and, and to equip the
saints for the work of the ministry and.

00:31:07.725 --> 00:31:12.575
The new Testament in the book
of acts, prioritize, multiplying

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.915
churches all around their area.

00:31:15.915 --> 00:31:20.985
And ultimately you see that today we
are a result of a church being planted

00:31:21.225 --> 00:31:24.405
because of their dedication to go
to those areas and plant churches.

00:31:25.275 --> 00:31:27.585
And, and so we wanna be dedicated.

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:28.605
This is the crazy part.

00:31:29.805 --> 00:31:30.555
Look around you guys.

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:31.635
See a lot of empty seats.

00:31:32.505 --> 00:31:34.125
You think we could put
some more seats back there?

00:31:34.665 --> 00:31:35.595
We can keep growing.

00:31:35.985 --> 00:31:40.215
And I pray that we do because we wanna
multiply disciples in groups, but I pray

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:43.095
that we will one day and it may be soon.

00:31:43.875 --> 00:31:44.804
We'll go start another church.

00:31:44.804 --> 00:31:46.514
We'll send somebody out to
go start another church.

00:31:46.695 --> 00:31:49.274
And you're saying, wait, we
could just fill up these chairs.

00:31:49.695 --> 00:31:50.355
I hope we do.

00:31:51.945 --> 00:31:55.965
But I believe this, that if we focus
on God's kingdom, expanding over our

00:31:55.965 --> 00:32:01.065
kingdom, expanding that we will start
churches because it'll be uncomfortable.

00:32:01.065 --> 00:32:01.335
It'll be D.

00:32:02.505 --> 00:32:04.275
Why, why do you start another church?

00:32:04.695 --> 00:32:07.605
Because there's a group of people
in another area of our city or in

00:32:07.605 --> 00:32:12.285
another city that locally or around
the world that is waiting on us to get

00:32:12.285 --> 00:32:16.545
uncomfortable, to take the message that
we have the power of God inside of us,

00:32:16.725 --> 00:32:20.805
and to continue to do what Jesus did to
continue to do what the early church did.

00:32:21.135 --> 00:32:21.795
Just like Paul did.

00:32:21.795 --> 00:32:24.645
It was not easy for Paul to go to
those different areas and start

00:32:24.645 --> 00:32:26.505
churches, guess go look at his stories.

00:32:26.685 --> 00:32:27.465
And, and here's the thing.

00:32:27.465 --> 00:32:29.955
If you haven't read the Bible
lately, go to the book of acts.

00:32:29.955 --> 00:32:31.035
It's one of my favorite books.

00:32:32.445 --> 00:32:35.475
I mean, it'll challenge your faith, but
you'll see the spirit of God working

00:32:35.475 --> 00:32:39.585
through ordinary people in difficult
circumstances, planting churches, going

00:32:39.765 --> 00:32:45.135
on, missionary journeys, bringing people
with them and seeing God change lives.

00:32:45.135 --> 00:32:46.485
That's what we wanna see in our church.

00:32:46.485 --> 00:32:49.035
We wanna see God continue to change lives.

00:32:49.965 --> 00:32:52.935
So when we think about this,
but what is a church, right?

00:32:52.935 --> 00:32:54.285
When we think about it, what is a church?

00:32:54.495 --> 00:32:58.245
A church is a gathering of people to
meet under a common, spiritual purpose.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.649
Again, we saw that Paul explained
to Timothy, we've walked through

00:33:01.649 --> 00:33:02.790
the book of first Timothy, right?

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:06.690
How to set up leadership and why
it's important to have elders and,

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.580
and people to help lead out that.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:09.180
Right.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.490
So I'm not gonna get
into the details of that.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:17.399
Um, but I do believe this, that that
got, has called us to continue to create

00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:21.780
groups of people that are on mission
together, cuz we are better together.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:22.139
Right?

00:33:22.409 --> 00:33:23.370
We are better together.

00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:26.250
So if we look at this.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.120
And we see the last part of
our strategy is biblical.

00:33:30.125 --> 00:33:32.250
I, I, I'm telling you, this
is what I've told everybody.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.940
If there's ever a day where I preach
a message, that's not biblical,

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.480
pull me aside, pull out your
Bible and say, you're unbiblical.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.810
And then here's the thing we may
disagree, but I'll just tell you this.

00:33:42.815 --> 00:33:44.340
I wanna continually go
back to the word of God.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.120
And that's what I did this week.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.430
I wanna continue to say, what did God do?

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:48.780
How did God set up the church?

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:49.890
How did God fulfill the.

00:33:51.945 --> 00:33:55.514
And he fulfilled the mission,
what I saw in these three ways.

00:33:55.754 --> 00:34:00.824
And it, and it's the, the so
key, he didn't just say, this

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:04.334
is how you fulfill the mission
by letting certain people do it.

00:34:04.334 --> 00:34:07.905
He says all of us have a role
in fulfilling the mission.

00:34:08.745 --> 00:34:11.594
So why have we had a
series over next steps?

00:34:12.525 --> 00:34:15.435
I'll just tell you this,
because I am burdened that we

00:34:15.435 --> 00:34:17.565
are in a place as a church.

00:34:19.574 --> 00:34:22.065
That is gonna require every
one of us, including me as your

00:34:22.065 --> 00:34:23.415
pastor to take a next step.

00:34:24.855 --> 00:34:27.885
And here's the thing I, I can't tell
you, I mean, I could sit down with

00:34:27.885 --> 00:34:31.844
you and we could talk about it and I'd
love to do that, but I can't fully tell

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:35.475
you what that is, but I know God will
reveal that to you as you seek him.

00:34:36.225 --> 00:34:40.245
And I believe that when you do, you
will see lives, change in your life.

00:34:40.635 --> 00:34:42.945
And when you do, you'll
see God's kingdom expanded.

00:34:43.034 --> 00:34:45.074
And when you do, you'll be
fulfilling the mission that

00:34:45.074 --> 00:34:46.245
God's called us to fulfill as a.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:52.109
But here's the thing we'll step on
some toes, but when you choose comfort,

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:56.009
when you choose to continue to do
the same thing, you're choosing to

00:34:56.009 --> 00:34:59.669
red reject God's plan for your life
to continue to grow in your faith,

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:01.350
to continue to take steps of faith.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:05.220
And again, I can't tell you everybody's
is gonna look different, right?

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.419
I can give you some suggestions.

00:35:06.419 --> 00:35:07.529
I can give you some ideas.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.819
I can walk alongside you as you pour into
the word, but that's not for me to fully

00:35:11.819 --> 00:35:15.450
tell you, because I believe that if you
have a relationship with Jesus, He will

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:17.189
tell you, but you have to seek him first.

00:35:18.149 --> 00:35:20.700
So how are we going to finish up today?

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:26.189
How do we, how do we finish up
and think through the rest of our,

00:35:28.169 --> 00:35:31.890
our, our series here and thinking,
how do we take a next step?

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:33.210
There's three areas.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.169
I'm gonna just gonna challenge you in.

00:35:34.169 --> 00:35:35.160
Actually, I'll give you four areas.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.930
So you can, you can take a
next step in just in the area.

00:35:37.439 --> 00:35:39.720
As a church, we believe to
fulfill the mission that God has

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.950
given us to see God's kingdom.

00:35:42.435 --> 00:35:43.875
It starts with following Jesus.

00:35:44.085 --> 00:35:46.545
That's a great next step.

00:35:47.415 --> 00:35:49.545
There, there, there, I, I don't know.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:52.305
I mean, again, I, I, I can't tell
you, there's not like an on switch

00:35:52.305 --> 00:35:54.585
where I can look at everybody and say,
everybody's getting the left of Jesus.

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:57.405
I don't have to share the gospel or
an off switch that says nobody's given

00:35:57.405 --> 00:36:00.525
the left to Jesus, but, you know,
If you, haven't given your life to

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:04.395
Jesus, if you haven't surrendered to
who, who Christ is that he died for

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.215
your sins, that you have given your
life to him, that you've accepted that

00:36:07.215 --> 00:36:10.305
forgiveness and that you begin to walk
in faith, then maybe that's you today.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:13.245
And that's a perfect first step,
because if you try to take another

00:36:13.245 --> 00:36:14.685
step, you're taking it really in vain.

00:36:14.685 --> 00:36:15.945
There's, there's not a really reason.

00:36:15.945 --> 00:36:18.975
And to go do, you know, live in
community and, and serve this around you.

00:36:18.975 --> 00:36:22.695
If you, if you don't have a relationship
with Jesus, those won't value as much.

00:36:22.695 --> 00:36:23.535
I'll just put it that way.

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:26.265
But another way that you could do
that is to live in community, right?

00:36:26.265 --> 00:36:28.965
If you've given your life to
Jesus, Living in community is

00:36:28.965 --> 00:36:30.255
one of the greatest things.

00:36:30.495 --> 00:36:34.095
Uh, I'll tell you this, every single
person that has ever been in our

00:36:34.095 --> 00:36:37.365
inspired groups, or we've got to
eat dinner with, I haven't heard

00:36:37.365 --> 00:36:40.275
any of, 'em say I hate this now.

00:36:40.275 --> 00:36:41.235
I don't wanna do this again.

00:36:41.235 --> 00:36:41.865
This is horrible.

00:36:41.865 --> 00:36:43.155
You people are crazy now.

00:36:43.155 --> 00:36:46.275
Maybe they just don't tell me that
to put my face, but you know what

00:36:46.275 --> 00:36:49.035
I have heard and I love this group.

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:51.150
Man, I need this.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.990
I'm so glad that I, I found this
group, this group of people who

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:59.340
love me, who encourage me, who
help me be equipped in my faith.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.990
I need this group of people.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.940
See, that's what I hear.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.150
And so I would just challenge you
if you're not a part of group.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:09.870
I know we've we said this before, but back
on our next steps table, we have a card

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:12.360
that we want you to fill out and I should
have just handed it all out to you today.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.120
Cuz the week that we did it, I
don't think there was anybody here,

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.190
but I wanted you to fill it out.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:18.750
I wanted you to tell
me when could you do a.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:22.620
When could, if you, if you could
have one night of the week that you

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.569
could have a group, when would it be?

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:28.259
We may not be able to have that group
that night, but you know what I we'll do.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:33.089
We're committed to have every family in
this church, a part of an inspired group.

00:37:33.095 --> 00:37:36.720
Even if you can't attend where we can pray
for you, we can reach out, encourage you.

00:37:36.779 --> 00:37:39.450
And the night that you can meet,
we may have you over for dinner

00:37:40.259 --> 00:37:43.049
because we want, we desire you so
much to be a part of community.

00:37:43.379 --> 00:37:45.180
We don't want it to be a time constraint.

00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:48.660
If that's what it is, because
I know sometimes Wednesday

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:49.440
nights doesn't work for you.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.790
And we have a grip that's
starting on Monday nights.

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.080
I know Monday, night's not
gonna not work for you.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.210
And if doesn't we'll
work something else out.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.589
So that may be a next step for you.

00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:58.200
Another one obviously is if
you've already given your life to

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.720
Christ, you're part of living in
community, serving those around you.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.520
And I'm not talking
about just serve Sundays.

00:38:02.525 --> 00:38:03.629
I'm talking about every day.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:08.640
Do you know that the act of service
draws a lot of conversations,

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.960
you buy somebody's lunch, you
know, you change somebody's tire.

00:38:13.814 --> 00:38:17.265
You go over, did you know that serving
somebody could really just be going

00:38:17.265 --> 00:38:21.254
over and giving words of encouragement
and then they go, you're different.

00:38:21.794 --> 00:38:22.245
Why?

00:38:22.245 --> 00:38:25.245
And you can go this God
has so changed my life.

00:38:26.055 --> 00:38:29.625
That I wanna be more like
Christ by serving people.

00:38:30.285 --> 00:38:32.535
And they'll be like, well, who's Jesus.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.475
And why does Jesus challenge,
like where do you see this?

00:38:35.475 --> 00:38:37.604
And then you can just begin to say,
here's what I know, because here,

00:38:37.604 --> 00:38:41.535
if you don't know a lot, you can say
here's what I do know that Jesus Christ

00:38:41.535 --> 00:38:42.825
came into the world to safe sinner.

00:38:43.695 --> 00:38:45.135
And you can say this, cuz
I say this all the time.

00:38:45.135 --> 00:38:46.095
I am the worst of them.

00:38:47.025 --> 00:38:49.395
And so there's nobody too far
from God that cannot be saved.

00:38:49.395 --> 00:38:49.755
Right?

00:38:50.175 --> 00:38:52.335
So maybe it's serving those
around him around you.

00:38:53.085 --> 00:38:55.095
Ultimately you could be a
part of multiplying, right?

00:38:55.095 --> 00:38:56.655
We're talking about expanding
God kingdom by multiplying

00:38:56.655 --> 00:38:59.565
disciples, groups and churches.

00:39:00.495 --> 00:39:03.885
This is one where I probably haven't
made this statement here to this group.

00:39:05.295 --> 00:39:08.265
What if I know God's calling you
to multiply disciples because

00:39:08.265 --> 00:39:08.955
if you've given your life to.

00:39:09.735 --> 00:39:10.755
You're part of that picture.

00:39:11.175 --> 00:39:15.015
What if God's called you to be a part
of multiplying groups to lead out

00:39:17.085 --> 00:39:18.375
and be the next group that starts?

00:39:18.375 --> 00:39:21.885
What if God is calling you to multiply
a church and you're the next church

00:39:21.885 --> 00:39:25.485
planner sitting outta this church
and you're going, what not me.

00:39:25.845 --> 00:39:28.245
I've said that before, and
I'm saying it here today.

00:39:28.665 --> 00:39:31.635
So you can begin to pray
and say, Lord, is that me?

00:39:32.385 --> 00:39:33.555
Could I be a part of this group?

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:35.205
Could I start a new group?

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.720
Maybe it's just, God's put somebody
on your heart to multiply, which means

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.549
there's somebody on your heart that
you're gonna go tell Jesus about.

00:39:41.819 --> 00:39:44.700
I just gave you a lot of ways that you
can take a next step in that's the point

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:50.759
of com uh, what we talk about, um, at the
end of a service, where we reflect, right?

00:39:50.819 --> 00:39:55.290
Where we reflect on what we feel like God
is speaking to us, we call it a time of

00:39:55.290 --> 00:40:00.209
invitation because we are inviting you
to take a next step every single week.

00:40:00.209 --> 00:40:03.540
If you ever wonder what invitation
is, it's inviting you to take a next.

00:40:04.485 --> 00:40:07.245
And here's what I know if you have
a pulse and if you don't know how to

00:40:07.245 --> 00:40:10.845
take your pulse, if you're breathing,
every one of us can take a next step.

00:40:10.995 --> 00:40:11.385
Amen.

00:40:12.255 --> 00:40:12.585
All right.

00:40:13.035 --> 00:40:14.115
I'm gonna pray for us.

00:40:14.325 --> 00:40:16.515
And after I get done praying,
I just wanna remind you this.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.865
I'm always in the back.

00:40:18.945 --> 00:40:20.175
Why do I stay in the back?

00:40:20.865 --> 00:40:22.515
Cuz I'm an introvert and I
don't like being upfront.

00:40:23.325 --> 00:40:28.425
No, I stay in the back for you not
to, to point anything out, but to talk

00:40:29.085 --> 00:40:30.495
to pray with you, to encourage you.

00:40:31.515 --> 00:40:32.715
Obviously, if you don't
need me, that's fine.

00:40:32.715 --> 00:40:35.025
I'll stand back there and
pray as well just by myself.

00:40:35.355 --> 00:40:37.605
But I just challenge you during
this time to seek the Lord on

00:40:37.605 --> 00:40:39.045
what next step you can take.

00:40:40.005 --> 00:40:42.585
And I, I love making this
last statement before I pray.

00:40:43.695 --> 00:40:48.135
There is somebody waiting
on you to take a next step.

00:40:48.855 --> 00:40:49.635
Don't leave him waiting.

00:40:50.595 --> 00:40:51.345
Don't leave him waiting.

00:40:52.275 --> 00:40:55.275
I was part of that story and I'm so
glad Scott didn't leave me waiting.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:00.600
And I know there's somebody on your heart
and mind as you take a next step, they're

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.879
waiting on you to reflect Christ to them.

00:41:03.299 --> 00:41:04.560
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.220
We love you.

00:41:05.609 --> 00:41:06.419
We thank you Lord.

00:41:06.419 --> 00:41:06.870
For today.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:12.540
We thank you so much, Lord, for just an
opportunity to come together, because I

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:18.930
think Lord, at times we take for granted
the opportunity we have to freely meet.

00:41:19.049 --> 00:41:22.980
There's so many countries that
are not able to freely meet.

00:41:23.625 --> 00:41:29.175
Or they would be killed, but Lord, we,
we come in here every week and we have

00:41:29.175 --> 00:41:30.495
the option to come in here every week.

00:41:30.495 --> 00:41:31.665
And some weeks we choose not to.

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:34.845
And some weeks we choose to, but Lord,
you've given us the ability to have a

00:41:34.845 --> 00:41:41.235
group like this, a church that's committed
to the mission that you've given us, that

00:41:41.235 --> 00:41:46.875
we've found in your word and Lord, I'm so
thankful for every person in this room.

00:41:46.935 --> 00:41:47.805
That's a part of that.

00:41:48.735 --> 00:41:49.845
It's a part of this journey.

00:41:50.475 --> 00:41:52.965
To continue to see Hamilton
and the surrounding areas

00:41:52.965 --> 00:41:55.125
come to know you, the Lord.

00:41:55.125 --> 00:42:00.645
I know that as a church, the way forward
is not addition, but multiplication.

00:42:02.055 --> 00:42:05.415
So Lord, I'm praying that in each person's
heart in this room, including my own,

00:42:06.195 --> 00:42:09.825
that we seek you and we say, Lord, how
can we be a part of that multiplication?

00:42:10.395 --> 00:42:16.695
How can we go out and display the
love of Christ to those around us?

00:42:17.295 --> 00:42:18.015
How can we.

00:42:19.215 --> 00:42:21.435
Minister to one another
better in this community.

00:42:22.665 --> 00:42:26.385
How can we grow closer
to you in our faith Lord?

00:42:26.385 --> 00:42:31.965
And as we take next steps, Lord, we see it
as such a benefit Lord that it is greater

00:42:31.965 --> 00:42:33.345
than anything else we could choose.

00:42:34.215 --> 00:42:37.245
And Lord that as we choose it, as
we choose to take that next step

00:42:37.245 --> 00:42:41.595
Lord, that you begin to BR bring
in a peace and a confidence Lord

00:42:41.595 --> 00:42:42.765
that we are living our faith out.

00:42:43.095 --> 00:42:46.545
We are taking a next step
and we're figuring out Lord

00:42:46.545 --> 00:42:47.325
what you've called us to.

00:42:48.705 --> 00:42:52.455
Lord that we will continue to
take those steps out of that joy

00:42:52.575 --> 00:42:53.745
Lord that we receive out of that.

00:42:54.885 --> 00:43:02.175
Um, Lord, we just pray, uh, for the
person in this room, Lord, um, who may

00:43:02.175 --> 00:43:03.885
be just struggling Lord in their faith.

00:43:05.055 --> 00:43:07.275
Uh, Lord, I'm praying for the
person who may be struggling

00:43:07.275 --> 00:43:09.615
to just fully surrender to you.

00:43:10.185 --> 00:43:12.465
And, uh, Lord, I pray
that today they choose.

00:43:13.275 --> 00:43:15.285
To say yes to you, Lord.

00:43:15.285 --> 00:43:19.365
I, I pray that they choose to just
step out and to come back and to talk

00:43:19.365 --> 00:43:21.734
to me about how to get their lives to
Christ or how to take the next step.

00:43:22.634 --> 00:43:26.504
Lord, don't let them be
too scared or defeated.

00:43:27.615 --> 00:43:29.955
Well, Lord, give them
boldness to take that step.

00:43:31.335 --> 00:43:34.245
So Lord, we love you and we praise you
and we pray this in your heaven name.

00:43:34.875 --> 00:43:35.174
Amen.

00:43:35.595 --> 00:43:35.835
Amen.
