00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.060
Yep.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.039
Um, and so super excited about
today, um, and the opportunity

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.180
to share with you guys.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.400
Um, a couple things and, and I, you know,
back at my past church that I was at, uh,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.360
in Oklahoma, we always took, um, usually
the first Sunday that we met and we would

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.870
take some time to reflect on the year
before, and then we would take some time

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.640
to cast vision for the year coming up.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.480
And I loved that because I felt like,
um, one of the things is, is if you

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.960
don't celebrate what you just went
through and you try to just cast

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.410
vision for what you're going towards,
you really miss some key things.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.100
And whenever I begin to just reflect
on all that God has done this year,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.489
guys, that some of the things I'm
gonna read today, I started going, oh

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.269
my gosh, like, wow, there was a lot of
things that our church was involved in.

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.330
Each one of us was involved in
some lives change, and, and I

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.800
just was just blown away by it.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.519
And so I'm hoping that you'll celebrate
the same way that I celebrated and

00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:56.429
just reflect on really how much
our church has been a part of.

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.209
And then as we begin to talk about,
um, the new year and some new things

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:03.690
for, for us to be involved in, for our
whole church to be involved in that.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.370
You guys will be excited to be a part of
that and you'll be excited to, um, what I

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.050
would even say this, to begin to pray and
just ask the Lord to guide and direct us.

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.320
Um, because I believe this year,
and this is my statement today, this

00:01:16.324 --> 00:01:17.460
year is going to be a year of faith.

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:18.900
Usually there's some kind of word.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.210
And last year, it's kind of
interesting, last year I kinda

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:23.250
had this word faithful, right?

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.560
Faithful was kind of like this
idea of no matter what's going on

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.870
around me, I wanna be faithful.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.949
Well, this year the Lord gave
me the word faith and I believe

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:33.150
this is gonna be a year of faith.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.589
And, and the crazy part about that
is, In three years of church planting,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.619
you would think, man, you know,
you guys have already had to have a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.940
lot of faith to get to this point.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.589
As a church, here's my conviction
and I hope you feel it as well.

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:50.009
I believe we're gonna need
even more faith this year.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.210
And what do you mean by more faith?

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:53.580
We can't, is there, is there like
an unlimited amount of faith?

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.530
Yes, but it's trusting God more
this year than we ever have before.

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:00.600
Man, that's maybe a
better way to explain it.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.460
So it's gonna be a year of faith.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.940
And so I wanna start off by asking some
questions you guys to get kind of some

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.889
feedback from you before we jump in.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.130
And the reason why is you guys
have showed up here today for some

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:15.420
reason, and I'm hoping it's not
just free childcare and coffee.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.690
And if it is, great, I'm hoping they take
care of your kids and that coffee's great,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.970
but you've shown up here for a reason.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.190
You've come back for a reason.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.609
You love this church, or you're
trying out this church for a reason.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.140
And what I would love is for us
to kind of share why you are here.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.210
Why you're here at Inspiring Hope.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.680
Why do you keep coming back?

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.460
I would love to hear a little bit of that
before we jump in and reflect on the year.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.140
So whoever wants to jump in first,
why are you here at Inspiring Hope

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.640
and why do you keep coming back?

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.799
Community.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.380
What else?

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.140
You don't know why the alarm
goes off and you show up.

00:02:59.049 --> 00:02:59.540
Yeah.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.630
Be able to grow your relationship.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.079
We got here.

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:01.620
Awesome.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.090
What else?

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.050
Mm-hmm.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.500
. Cool.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.690
So you love the vision.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.220
You're committed to it.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.730
Awesome.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.310
Yes.

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:24.060
Cool.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.560
Couple more people.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.820
Why are you here?

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.840
Why do you keep coming back?

00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:32.954
Yeah.

00:03:54.765 --> 00:03:55.375
Mm-hmm.

00:03:57.185 --> 00:03:57.674
. Cool.

00:03:58.095 --> 00:03:58.364
Yeah.

00:03:59.055 --> 00:03:59.834
That's awesome.

00:04:00.614 --> 00:04:01.005
Cool.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.045
Anybody else?

00:04:03.315 --> 00:04:04.065
Why are you here?

00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:05.714
Why do you keep coming back?

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:10.185
One more person.

00:04:10.305 --> 00:04:11.475
I'm just gonna challenge one more person.

00:04:11.475 --> 00:04:12.704
If you just talk, we'll move on.

00:04:17.204 --> 00:04:17.925
Anybody?

00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:20.625
Okay?

00:04:21.164 --> 00:04:23.235
Yes, they, they're working.

00:04:23.985 --> 00:04:24.465
They're working.

00:04:24.465 --> 00:04:27.075
Cuz I'm texting you and I'm
saying if you don't come.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.410
No . Hey, that's, that's okay.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.070
That's great.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.120
I know there's a reason why the spirit God
puts, puts you on my heart to text you.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.250
Um, well, um, I, I know many of you
are just even afraid to talk and

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.920
you have some reasons why you're
here and why you keep coming back.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.490
Um, but I, I'm gonna have Matt and
Amanda share why they joined Inspiring

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.520
Hope, why they keep coming back and
serving and doing what they're gonna do.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.860
I'm gonna let them share for a little
bit and then I'm gonna jump in and we'll,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.410
we're gonna get going, but I'd love for
you guys to hear kind of their story.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.960
Go in the middle.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.300
Hi, everybody.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.120
Um, so we didn't really negotiate
what we're gonna talk about

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.130
beforehand, which we should have,
I think we both had in our head.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.410
So we're both gonna talk, but we'll
try to keep it as short as possible.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.700
Um, so I know for me, I, I grew
up in the church but sort of

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.560
bounced around churches growing up.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.240
Never was really committed any place.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.190
Um, moved out to Ohio from California.

00:05:20.715 --> 00:05:22.755
Found a church but wasn't really involved.

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:25.965
We met, got married, had a
church, weren't really involved,

00:05:25.965 --> 00:05:26.955
tried to get involved, couldn't.

00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:28.815
And there was just like this really
weird thing of like, we couldn't

00:05:28.815 --> 00:05:31.875
find a church that was providing
what we wanted for ourselves.

00:05:32.205 --> 00:05:34.695
Um, and it was actually
really interesting.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.455
I was sort of complaining about this
to one of my mentors at one point

00:05:37.455 --> 00:05:40.485
and I was like, we just, there's no
churches that are what we want it to be.

00:05:40.844 --> 00:05:45.525
And she was like, well, why don't
you create what you want in a church?

00:05:46.034 --> 00:05:47.235
And I was like, what?

00:05:47.474 --> 00:05:50.625
And she was like, well, you know, if
you have this laid on your heart, if

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:53.474
there's something specific that you're
looking for, if you want community of

00:05:53.474 --> 00:05:57.495
people who actually care about you,
if you want, you know, whatever, you

00:05:57.495 --> 00:05:59.865
know, list of laundry, list of things
I was saying I wanted at the time.

00:05:59.865 --> 00:06:02.595
She's like, Be the church
because you are the church.

00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:05.145
Um, and so, um, I'm gonna cry.

00:06:05.145 --> 00:06:05.475
Gosh.

00:06:05.685 --> 00:06:09.345
Um, so when we had this opportunity, we
actually were almost a part of like a

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.505
church revitalization effort And, uh,
a few years ago, before Ben and Britney

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.225
even had a inspiring hope as a glimmer
in their eye, um, that fell apart.

00:06:18.225 --> 00:06:20.385
And so we kind of started to
get excited about this idea

00:06:20.385 --> 00:06:21.974
of like, What do we create?

00:06:21.974 --> 00:06:25.455
Like we get to be on the ground floor
of starting something new and, and

00:06:25.455 --> 00:06:28.424
helping to be the church that we want.

00:06:28.664 --> 00:06:30.705
Um, and then fell through was very sad.

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:33.375
Um, anyways, and then we met Ben
and Brittany through our previous

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.155
church, and it was just very clear
that this was that opportunity.

00:06:37.484 --> 00:06:42.075
Uh, we loved the mission and the vision
that Ben shared and his heart for

00:06:42.284 --> 00:06:46.815
wanting to spread the gospel through
practical things, not just through,

00:06:46.815 --> 00:06:49.815
you know, shouting on the rooftops or
on the street corners, but by being

00:06:49.815 --> 00:06:53.174
in the schools and by being in the
community and by actually putting walk

00:06:53.174 --> 00:06:54.465
to the things that we were talking.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:59.865
Um, and so, yeah, I think, you know,
for us, or I'll say for me, um, it's

00:06:59.865 --> 00:07:05.565
very much about, you know, I, I never
had a church community that came around

00:07:05.565 --> 00:07:08.955
me that loved me, that would mentor
me, that would disciple me growing up.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.924
And so now we have the opportunity
to be the community that

00:07:11.924 --> 00:07:13.604
we wish we had in the past.

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:18.224
Yeah, I mean, I would, I would
definitely echo a lot of that.

00:07:18.224 --> 00:07:23.775
I think, um, For me, it was, it was, uh,
a lot of, you know, kind of growing up in

00:07:23.775 --> 00:07:26.354
church and being kind of half in, right?

00:07:26.354 --> 00:07:30.525
Like, especially, you know, being a
teenager and, and doing like just a

00:07:30.525 --> 00:07:33.075
little bit here, a little bit there,
going on youth retreats, but not

00:07:33.075 --> 00:07:40.094
really plugged in, specifically plugged
in, in my faith, um, as an adult.

00:07:41.354 --> 00:07:45.405
Um, you know, getting married and,
and just realizing the, the weight

00:07:45.435 --> 00:07:51.195
of taking on our relationship, our
spiritual relationship and, and my

00:07:51.195 --> 00:07:54.075
own, you know, um, position to God.

00:07:54.075 --> 00:07:59.145
I, I kinda had to, to make some, some
kind of radical, radical changes, I

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.435
think, in the way that, that I thought.

00:08:00.435 --> 00:08:04.664
But I also believe full, uh,
wholeheartedly that, that God was

00:08:04.664 --> 00:08:10.664
involved in that process too, that I
started to see my, my role a little bit

00:08:10.664 --> 00:08:14.325
differently because of changes in my
life, but that God put that on my heart.

00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:17.969
And that he did a lot of the
heavy lifting to change my heart.

00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:21.359
And one of the first ways that I
think he started to change my heart

00:08:21.359 --> 00:08:26.429
was towards giving one of the very
first things that we did as a couple.

00:08:26.729 --> 00:08:31.320
Um, we made it a deliberate decision
to start giving monthly to the church.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:34.770
And we said, minimum is 10%,
not because that's, you know,

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.780
some, some like, holy thing.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.039
But because that, that was what, you
know, I think God put into our hearts

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:43.620
that said, you're committed, you're in.

00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:46.949
And it was weird because I
mean, and, and it makes sense.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.520
Uh, you know, Jesus talks in the New
Testament and the gospels about, you know,

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.880
where your, um, where your treasures are.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.900
That's also where, um,
your heart is, right?

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.000
And so in that phase of our life, our,
our treasure was very much in our money.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:07.439
You know, early marriage, you know,
we , we, we didn't have a lot to

00:09:07.439 --> 00:09:09.540
commit, so we decided this was hard.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.180
We're gonna do it, we're gonna
commit it, and we're going to.

00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:18.315
Use whatever pain or struggle or, or
complication or whatever, whatever

00:09:18.315 --> 00:09:22.065
it is, we're gonna use that as a way
to remind us of God's faithfulness.

00:09:22.905 --> 00:09:24.105
And you know what the crazy thing was?

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.065
Like God was faithful through, through it
and we didn't really struggle as much as

00:09:28.065 --> 00:09:29.595
I think we, we thought we were going to.

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:37.875
The second way that I think God started to
impress on my heart, um, that I needed to,

00:09:37.905 --> 00:09:46.095
to change was there was a drive in me to
get plugged in and to get involved and to

00:09:46.095 --> 00:09:48.495
be like a servant rather than to receive.

00:09:50.235 --> 00:09:52.365
And I don't, I don't, don't
entirely know why that is.

00:09:52.365 --> 00:09:55.395
That might be per personality, but
I also think that, that the Lord was

00:09:55.425 --> 00:10:01.785
waking something up in my heart to say,
look like there is a time to be served.

00:10:01.785 --> 00:10:06.525
And there's also a time where, where I'm
calling you to do something, you know,

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.385
I'm calling you to, to do something.

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:12.960
Um, You know, for the Kingdom of
God for me, not just for yourself

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.310
and the selfishness that I felt, the
selfishness of time, the selfishness,

00:10:17.315 --> 00:10:19.200
again, you know, financial selfishness.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.580
I, I think God was calling me to start
to think differently about those things.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:29.670
Where my time was not just my own,
you know, my, my strength and my,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.570
um, capabilities were not just
things that I could use, you know,

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:39.780
to make money or, um, you know, to do
hobbies or, um, you know, to, to do

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.100
stuff around the house or whatever.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:46.320
Like, it was always something, you know,
I just, I felt like the Lord was calling

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.140
me, you know, into something else.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.920
And I mean, we, we bounced around,
uh, a couple churches, I think

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.960
early, um, in around 2016 we
moved to ci, the Cincinnati area.

00:10:59.365 --> 00:11:02.130
. And it was weird because it was one
of those things where I started to

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.810
feel like God was calling me to serve.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.870
But every church that we went
to, there was nowhere to serve.

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.250
It was all, it was all done.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.990
It was like all done for me.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.610
And it was just a struggle.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.810
But I think, you know, again, the Lord
was in that, that like inability to

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.490
get plugged in in the wrong place.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:18.720
Does that make sense?

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:23.940
Like we didn't get plugged in at any
of the big churches around because the

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.320
Lord had something be better for us.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.100
And like Amanda said, when, when
the opportunity arose to try to

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.110
do the revitalization project, we
were like, that sounds really cool.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.120
I think because we had already
started to feel the fire, you

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.550
know, starting to, to glow, right?

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:46.650
Of, you know what, like there are people
in this world that are suffering there.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.550
There are people in this world that are
just tired, tired of life and tired of,

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.950
of the struggle, and they need help.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.030
They need something better.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:58.109
And the idea of a church being in
that position, we were like, Let's

00:11:58.109 --> 00:11:59.550
go, let's we're, you know, we're in.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:04.680
And sadly that that didn't work out, but
that led us to a place where eventually,

00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:08.939
um, you know, when, when we met Ben
and Britney, we started to catch their

00:12:08.939 --> 00:12:10.709
vision and their vision and our vision.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.719
It just seemed like it aligned.

00:12:13.589 --> 00:12:17.609
And it was, you know, at that point it
was just really easy for us to say, look,

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:22.859
you know, God lit this fire years ago in
our relationship, in our lives now I think

00:12:22.859 --> 00:12:27.719
he's, he's calling us to commit to jump
in and we don't know what it looks like.

00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:30.479
It could be, you know, an hour a week.

00:12:30.484 --> 00:12:33.719
It could be, you know, just coming
on Sundays and, and figuring out

00:12:33.724 --> 00:12:34.890
what, what needs to get done.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.729
Or it could be, you know, a little
bit, you know, progressive where

00:12:38.729 --> 00:12:40.859
it's, you know, a couple hours a week.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.469
And I think that's, that's where the Lord,
um, is calling us into is, is to say, I

00:12:46.469 --> 00:12:51.900
don't know what this is gonna look like,
but what if he does something great with.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:52.935
right?

00:12:53.475 --> 00:12:57.525
Like, it doesn't have to be, you know,
something stellar or, or, or earth

00:12:57.525 --> 00:13:02.235
shattering, you know, like five minutes
a week, you know, of, of a commitment

00:13:02.385 --> 00:13:06.584
of saying, you know, this would be my,
my time to, to relax, to watch tv, to

00:13:06.589 --> 00:13:10.214
read a book, to whatever, and say, Lord,
I want, I want to be able to spend this

00:13:10.214 --> 00:13:13.935
time with you and then for you, right?

00:13:14.175 --> 00:13:18.105
Like, you know, and it's crazy how
that five minutes turns into 10

00:13:18.105 --> 00:13:22.425
minutes, turns into 30 minutes, and
suddenly you start to feel that fire

00:13:22.425 --> 00:13:27.765
grow in your heart because at that
point, you're not the one doing it.

00:13:28.155 --> 00:13:29.385
The Lord is doing it in your heart.

00:13:29.954 --> 00:13:33.435
Um, and so that's, that's just
kind of my story, that hopefully

00:13:33.435 --> 00:13:36.155
that's our story in a nutshell,

00:13:36.944 --> 00:13:37.125
Awesome.

00:13:37.814 --> 00:13:38.834
Thanks so much for sharing.

00:13:39.255 --> 00:13:42.735
I know that, um, I could probably ask
that question to many of you, and if

00:13:42.735 --> 00:13:45.675
you were bold enough to be able to
share there, there's different reasons

00:13:45.675 --> 00:13:49.454
why God had put on your heart to join
Inspiring Hope or even to come visit.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.920
Um, and the reason why I want
you to think on that is because

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.820
I think that's critical.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:59.820
And so, you know, um, it, it's important
to think through why you're here.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.100
Um, because I think at times, whenever
you're thinking about a church, we're

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.250
a little bit smaller of a church
and so it's harder to be invisible.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.990
And so y'all know you're,
none of y'all are visible.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.700
Cuz I pretty much like I texted everybody.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:11.910
Okay.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.700
Cuz it's easy to do that as a small
church, it's easy to text everybody.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.000
Um, in a bigger church,
it's easier to hide.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:23.820
Um, and so you're, you're, you're,
I, I can see you, you can see me.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.680
We we're very close in this relationship.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.710
But asking that question, why
is so important in this season

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.420
as a church where we're heading.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.660
Um, because as a church,
this is our church.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.950
This is where I keep using that language.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.140
I used last year during Vision
Sunday, this is our church.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.240
This has no longer been
in Britt's Church plant.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:39.780
This is our.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:44.520
We all have a role to play and, and
the challenge will be today is to ask

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.930
that question, where is God calling
me to be in place in that role?

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.480
And for some of you, maybe you've
been coming for a year, maybe coming

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.060
for a couple weeks, you may say,
maybe this isn't the church for me.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.420
Maybe your why to being here is not
gonna match with what we're doing.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.890
Maybe it is, I, I I'm challenging you to
seek the Lord and, and figure that out,

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:06.180
and figure out what God's calling you to
do and to be a part of in this church.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.910
Um, my goal today is to,
to share a few things.

00:15:08.915 --> 00:15:11.970
So I'm gonna start with this
Habak two, two, that's a big word.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.830
Haba two, two says this.

00:15:13.835 --> 00:15:18.270
Then the Lord answered me and
said, write the vision and make it

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.150
plain on tablets that he may run.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.070
Whoever reads it, make it.

00:15:24.735 --> 00:15:26.925
On tablets that he may
run, whoever reads it.

00:15:26.925 --> 00:15:30.135
One of the goals of our church
ever since, uh, we started just

00:15:30.135 --> 00:15:32.295
writing on a piece of paper what
God would call us to plant a church.

00:15:32.295 --> 00:15:35.325
As I said this, I believe God's
called us to plant a simple

00:15:35.325 --> 00:15:36.345
and cost effective church.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.395
A simple and cost effective church.

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:37.755
Wanna know why?

00:15:37.755 --> 00:15:38.355
It's simple?

00:15:38.655 --> 00:15:43.215
Cuz I'm not very smart and I know
that if it's difficult for me, it's

00:15:43.215 --> 00:15:44.415
gonna be difficult for other people.

00:15:44.445 --> 00:15:46.905
And I'm, I think you guys are smarter
than me, so I can probably make it a

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:48.465
little bit more complicated, but simple.

00:15:48.465 --> 00:15:51.735
And the idea is that I don't think
we have to complicate how church

00:15:52.115 --> 00:15:53.505
functions, the body of Christ functions.

00:15:53.835 --> 00:15:56.175
And I think we need to make it
simple so that it's easy to know

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.495
how to be a part of the church.

00:15:57.495 --> 00:15:59.805
Because I think I've, I've had
that same story from other people.

00:16:00.045 --> 00:16:02.385
We go to a church and we don't
know how to get involved.

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:05.205
We wanna make it simple to get involved.

00:16:05.205 --> 00:16:07.335
And I think that's going to
continue to be a part of our

00:16:07.335 --> 00:16:09.465
mission and vision as we go forward.

00:16:09.855 --> 00:16:12.435
Um, but as I think about this
Year of faith, I wanna give you

00:16:12.435 --> 00:16:15.195
two examples before we kind of
talk about some celebrations.

00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:17.925
Um, one is the faith of Daniel.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.100
And this is, this is thought.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:20.970
Think about this idea.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.450
Daniel's faith again, Daniel was
the one that was in the lions den.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.810
His faith wasn't built in the lions den.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.050
It was already built in the prayer closet.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.200
If you'll remember Daniel's story,
he prayed three times a day.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.970
And when the lions den came,
he already had faith because

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.440
of his time with the Lord.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.590
So Daniel didn't wait until
the lion's in to have faith.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:47.670
I believe our leadership, I believe our
church has been in the prayer clause, I

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:52.500
believe, believe we've been praying in
seeking the Lord in this season ahead.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:58.980
I think we're ready and I'm praying that
we are ready, uh, and we all are ready

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.900
to be a part of what God has for us.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.850
We're gonna talk about
Abraham's story today.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.530
Um, and it's gonna take faith like
Abraham to see all that God wants us to

00:17:07.535 --> 00:17:12.089
see and experience this year, and, and
I'm ready to have faith and to do that.

00:17:12.899 --> 00:17:15.030
Before we jump off into that, I
wanna take some time to celebrate.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:19.169
So I want to kind of just fill you guys
in on 2022, what happened in the life

00:17:19.169 --> 00:17:21.480
of this church in some tangible way.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:24.659
If you've been here for a couple
weeks to three years, you've been

00:17:24.659 --> 00:17:27.210
a part of this last year, and I
wanna share some of those ways.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:31.050
First of all, we saw several kids in
adults give their lives to Christ and

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.520
fall through and believers' baptism,
we had several baby dedications.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.939
It seems like those are always
coming up, which is great.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.379
Um, we've had several members, and this
is hard to even associate with or even

00:17:43.385 --> 00:17:46.740
to count, but we've said several people
in our church take steps of faith,

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:51.300
start leading discipleship groups,
attending discipleship groups, uh,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.960
sharing their faith, inviting people
to church, coming to small group for

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.460
the first time, serving in the church,
inviting and continually being a part

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.600
of the mission of inspiring hope.

00:18:00.605 --> 00:18:03.870
And again, that's hard to even
measure, but I've seen so many of you

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.639
do those things of this last year.

00:18:06.524 --> 00:18:10.125
And when we think about, as a church,
we've committed to not be a church that's

00:18:10.125 --> 00:18:14.834
just in a building that's in our city to
be a but be a people that is in our city

00:18:15.524 --> 00:18:17.715
and we're known out in our community.

00:18:18.254 --> 00:18:20.145
And so I wanna just give you
some ways that we did that.

00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:23.475
So as a church, you probably heard
us mention this before, but we have

00:18:23.475 --> 00:18:27.314
church, other churches come to our
city and help us serve our city.

00:18:27.554 --> 00:18:28.574
They're called mission teams.

00:18:28.875 --> 00:18:32.715
Uh, and, and basically they'll send
anywhere between seven to 25 people,

00:18:32.955 --> 00:18:34.004
um, from five different states.

00:18:34.004 --> 00:18:40.365
We've had Oklahoma, Missouri, um,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky,

00:18:40.365 --> 00:18:41.504
and then I guess you'll count Ohio.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.975
Cause we've had some
teams in Ohio as well.

00:18:42.975 --> 00:18:46.425
But all these teams come from these
other churches to help us serve our city.

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:47.415
And so this is what they did.

00:18:47.415 --> 00:18:50.925
There was 10 different teams
that came last year, 175 people

00:18:51.225 --> 00:18:52.095
helped us serve our city.

00:18:52.095 --> 00:18:53.264
And let me tell you how we did that.

00:18:53.264 --> 00:18:58.215
We served local ministries such as
Pathway to Hope, hype Hopes Closet,

00:18:58.274 --> 00:19:02.324
boys and Girls Clubs, surf City, hospice
of Cincinnati, Booker t Washington,

00:19:02.324 --> 00:19:04.034
Y M C A, and Hopeful Pastures.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.020
Those are just the ministries,
several of our teams.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.770
Here's one of the cool parts.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.620
Several of our teams not only
just served in our community,

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.210
but served other churches.

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:14.340
Um, we want to be kingdom
minded as a church.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.550
And so we did that by partnering
with an Arabic church plant that was

00:19:17.554 --> 00:19:19.260
out of Lakota Hills in Westchester.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.460
We partnered and, and helped
serve the covering a couple of

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.320
days, which is out in Springdale.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:28.040
And then we also helped serve North
Fairfield Baptist with a few things that

00:19:28.045 --> 00:19:32.300
they needed, um, as well as writing,
encouraging notes and cards to all

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.420
of our local pastors in our community
because we wanna be kingdom to minus.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.250
So some of our, our team
helped us with that.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.130
Um, some of our teams
helped us serve at schools.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.160
So at Wilson Middle School and
Riverview Elementary, we, I know

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.490
at some point last year we brought
some gifts and encouraging cards.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:51.140
Um, at Wilson Middle School, we hosted
an afterschool event for 200 kids.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.660
Um, and that was an amazing opportunity.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.260
Um, some of our teams helped us
serve in local events, right?

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.310
Hosting events in the parks, sports camps,
volunteered at vacation Bible school.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.940
These teams canvased several homes
where they would just knock on doors

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.230
and say, Hey, how can we pray for you?

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:07.040
How can we serve you?

00:20:07.045 --> 00:20:07.820
How can we meet needs?

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.500
Some of them went back and built fences.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.030
Um, they raked yards.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.710
They did all kinds of opportunities.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.430
Um, and then just the last thing,
they brought breakfast and gifts to

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.200
local businesses and fire departments.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.740
To tell 'em that we love them and
support them and there's more.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.900
These are just mission teams from
outside of our state that came in

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.000
to say they would believe in the
vision, they believe in the ministry

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.040
of this church and this community.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.080
And they came in and loved on them.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.680
And I think that's amazing guys, that
we have that many people, 175 people,

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.240
10 different churches that want to
see Hamilton Minister to loved on and

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.010
supported and shared the love of Christ.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.770
And I think that's amazing that
we even had that many partners,

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.330
um, that God would do that.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.540
But let's just talk about
our team as, as a church.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.090
We had served Sundays and I'm, I think
we're gonna have to change that name

00:20:50.095 --> 00:20:51.200
cuz sometimes we don't serve on Sundays.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.450
Sometimes we serve on
Saturdays or Midweeks.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.420
So we had several serve opportunities
this past year as a church.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:59.600
So it, I'm just gonna kinda walk
through on the line of what we did.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.720
We, we wrote encouraging cards to
teachers and staff and packaged

00:21:02.725 --> 00:21:04.040
gifts specifically for them.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.130
Um, at the beginning of last year, we
had a parents' night out where several

00:21:07.135 --> 00:21:08.660
families came from the community.

00:21:09.645 --> 00:21:11.055
Um, and enjoyed that.

00:21:11.295 --> 00:21:14.655
We had an Easter egg hunt for
those that attended after service.

00:21:14.655 --> 00:21:18.945
We provided, um, a teacher appreciation
celebration for Wilson Middle School.

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:23.205
After, um, at the end of the year
on May, we hosted a VBS at Riverview

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:26.985
Elementary and a celebration Sunday
with a hundred people f in attendance.

00:21:27.135 --> 00:21:29.205
And as a church, you can tell like
there was several people from our

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.825
community that got to come out to that.

00:21:31.155 --> 00:21:34.545
Um, we, we put on a fall
fun fest at Riverview.

00:21:34.725 --> 00:21:36.015
It seems like we're always at Riverview.

00:21:36.435 --> 00:21:36.645
Okay.

00:21:36.645 --> 00:21:37.545
I think we're always there.

00:21:37.545 --> 00:21:37.725
Okay.

00:21:37.725 --> 00:21:40.425
It just seems like it, but
500 people came out to that.

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:42.945
We did, uh, uh, Hamilton
welcomes the holidays.

00:21:42.975 --> 00:21:44.025
Uh, several of you served there.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.125
We provided those
Christmas gifts to 20 kids.

00:21:46.545 --> 00:21:49.215
Um, and I know that those
families were majorly impacted.

00:21:49.635 --> 00:21:52.275
Um, I know for me personally, I was
involved several different times

00:21:52.275 --> 00:21:55.665
bringing breakfast to teachers,
um, in our community, I think at

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:56.895
four different schools this year.

00:21:57.405 --> 00:22:00.045
Um, and got the opportunity to
give motivational talks to teachers

00:22:00.045 --> 00:22:01.395
and staff as well as to student.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.810
And so much more.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.459
Those are just some of
the things I can remember.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.649
Like I'm going back on Facebook
looking at memories and we're not

00:22:07.649 --> 00:22:10.620
very good at sharing some of those
things, but I'm like, that's a lot of

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.300
stuff that we did just as a church.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.750
This group right here, and the few people
that are missing are online, right?

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.850
That that's the group
of people that did this.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.020
I think that's amazing.

00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:22.470
Like I'm not patting ourselves on
the back, is that we're a big deal.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:23.340
Here's what I wanna say.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:30.060
God did some really cool things through
us and I, I'm just thankful that he chose

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:35.520
us to do this, to come together as a group
to serve our city, because we want to be

00:22:35.524 --> 00:22:37.709
a church that is serving our community.

00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:40.649
I, I remember this, my pastor
reminded me this, if your church

00:22:40.649 --> 00:22:43.949
closed its doors today and leftist
community, would anybody know?

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:49.379
I believe our community would know
if we left because we're serving

00:22:49.385 --> 00:22:51.540
and, and my hope is the more and
more we build those relationships,

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.560
they know why we're serving.

00:22:52.564 --> 00:22:56.790
Not just the meet and need, which I wanna
meet, but to also see that we are doing

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.919
it because Jesus has changed our lives.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.790
So let me give you some updates, just
financially what we did as a church.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.430
I know some of you have some, some
questions about our month of generosity.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:06.450
I'm gonna give an update on that.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.720
But just so you even know as a
church, how we even fund our church,

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:14.610
and I've kind of shared this before,
but as a church, we, we gave, um,

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.400
$80,000 last year as as a church.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.450
And I think that's amazing.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.100
Uh, we gave $80,000.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:21.660
Outside of that.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.400
We have churches that support us.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.480
A lot of those teams that came, churches
that support us, they gave us $150,000

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.240
to be able to do ministry, um, this year.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.210
Uh, and again, you kind of see
those numbers pretty lopsided.

00:23:33.765 --> 00:23:37.065
Eventually that's gotta shift because
a, a, after a couple of years, those

00:23:37.065 --> 00:23:40.395
ministries will move on and they'll
stop supporting us and we'll start

00:23:40.395 --> 00:23:42.825
self-sustaining, hopefully as a church.

00:23:43.035 --> 00:23:44.505
And that requires all of us to do that.

00:23:44.775 --> 00:23:46.005
But what did we give this year?

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.165
Just through missions, we gave $9,700
towards church planners, church plants,

00:23:51.285 --> 00:23:55.185
I and b missionaries, our Southern
Baptist Cooperative Program Missions.

00:23:55.455 --> 00:23:59.685
Um, and as a church, we've committed
to give 10% away to those specifically.

00:23:59.955 --> 00:24:04.815
Um, every year, um, we gave $35,000
towards local ministries in our

00:24:04.815 --> 00:24:06.405
city or local missions in our city.

00:24:06.825 --> 00:24:10.725
Um, and out of that portion, so during
the month of December, because you

00:24:10.725 --> 00:24:13.245
guys gave, remember we said this,
for every dollar that's given in

00:24:13.245 --> 00:24:17.025
December, we'll give, we'll match that
and give that away to our community.

00:24:17.475 --> 00:24:20.745
You guys gave $12,000 in the
month of December, which is our

00:24:20.745 --> 00:24:23.445
biggest giving month we've ever
had, which I think's amazing.

00:24:23.445 --> 00:24:24.615
Guys, I think that's amazing.

00:24:24.615 --> 00:24:25.395
Three of you clapped.

00:24:25.455 --> 00:24:27.135
The rest of y'all just
celebrate in your hearts.

00:24:27.135 --> 00:24:27.615
It's okay.

00:24:28.965 --> 00:24:30.135
Um, why is that a big deal?

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:30.525
One.

00:24:31.935 --> 00:24:33.735
I really wanna stop and talk
about this for a minute.

00:24:34.965 --> 00:24:38.895
Once I think you guys knew where that
was going, you guys got very strategic.

00:24:39.525 --> 00:24:42.495
Some of you took November's tie,
then waited till the first, and

00:24:42.495 --> 00:24:45.225
then pulled in Januarys and threw in
Decembers in there just because you

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:46.515
knew all of it was being given away.

00:24:46.575 --> 00:24:47.205
I love it.

00:24:47.235 --> 00:24:47.865
I don't care.

00:24:47.925 --> 00:24:48.495
That's great.

00:24:48.885 --> 00:24:53.085
And we were able to give not just
$12,000 away, we're able to give $24,000

00:24:53.085 --> 00:24:58.875
away, $24,000 away to three local,
uh, groups in our, our, our community

00:24:58.875 --> 00:25:00.225
that we are wanting to invest in.

00:25:00.495 --> 00:25:03.345
A portion of that got given in the month
of December, and the rest of it will

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:06.135
be given, um, in this month because we
had to wait until the end of the month.

00:25:06.435 --> 00:25:09.195
But I think that is
amazing that we do that.

00:25:09.195 --> 00:25:10.875
But let me just throw something out here.

00:25:10.875 --> 00:25:15.825
Do, do you know that every single
month we give that away as well?

00:25:15.855 --> 00:25:17.205
Like, because you, when you.

00:25:17.925 --> 00:25:23.895
We actually give anywhere between 1500
to $2,500 as a give meaning we'll spend

00:25:23.895 --> 00:25:27.675
and invest in either breakfast for
teachers or giving to Pathway to Hope

00:25:27.675 --> 00:25:29.655
or buying supplies for families in need.

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:31.215
We're doing that every month.

00:25:31.215 --> 00:25:32.985
So if you're saying, Hey, well
I just wanna give in the month

00:25:32.985 --> 00:25:34.665
of December, and that's the
only time you're giving it away.

00:25:34.665 --> 00:25:36.165
No, we're giving it away every month.

00:25:36.555 --> 00:25:38.205
Um, and that's what's
really cool about that.

00:25:38.565 --> 00:25:42.735
Um, another cool thing is we gave
$6,700 towards benevolence in our,

00:25:42.735 --> 00:25:46.155
our, our church, which means this, we
will take care of our families here.

00:25:46.665 --> 00:25:51.225
If there is a need in this church, we will
take care of you why we are the church.

00:25:51.735 --> 00:25:55.215
And so we we're able to do that
this year and, and I'm just blessed

00:25:55.215 --> 00:25:56.355
that we were able to do that.

00:25:56.655 --> 00:26:00.795
Um, so total of $52,000 worth, I would
say, admission dollars that we spent

00:26:01.095 --> 00:26:03.375
locally and internationally in missions.

00:26:03.735 --> 00:26:04.755
$52,000.

00:26:04.755 --> 00:26:07.635
I don't know about anybody that may
be bigger than your annual salary.

00:26:08.085 --> 00:26:08.745
We gave that away.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.165
That's amazing that we were able
to give that away as a church.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.490
And there, there's so
much more that we did.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.370
I know we invested in children's and
students through all these different

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.950
activities that we did with them, but one
of the cool things we had to do with our

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.910
children's and students is the camp This
year we covered half the cost of all of

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.990
our kids', uh, camp, and the full cost
of all of our student camps and all of

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:30.000
our volunteers that went to serve them.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:33.060
So we invested heavily in them and
were wanting to continue to do that.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.860
So, small note, I know this is just
a small note of, of celebration

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.950
of what we did as a church,
missionally as we did financially.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.920
Um, and I'm just, I'm telling
you, I'm looking around and I'm,

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.660
I'm almost like laugh at times.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:50.850
I've been in churches 20 times our
size that don't match those numbers or

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.700
those activities in their community,
and that is not a knock to them.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.520
Just so you know, what I'm just
saying is God has taken a small group

00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:01.230
of people and he has done way more
than we could ever imagine or think.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.520
So God gets the glory for what
he's done and here's the cool part.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.480
We get to do it again this year.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:07.560
Isn't that fun?

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.690
And we get to involve
more people and do more.

00:27:09.695 --> 00:27:10.180
That's.

00:27:10.965 --> 00:27:12.735
You wanna know why I love
this church right there?

00:27:13.725 --> 00:27:15.285
I mean, I, yeah, you're the pastor.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:19.305
You have to be, I, I'm telling you, I
love being here because of the stories

00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:22.335
that we have from here and there's
so many more that we could share, but

00:27:22.335 --> 00:27:25.515
I just want to continue to encourage
you to be a part of things like this.

00:27:25.875 --> 00:27:27.255
Um, and so here's the question.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.425
What is it going to take?

00:27:29.115 --> 00:27:30.675
What ahead of us?

00:27:30.675 --> 00:27:30.885
Right?

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.145
And I think it's gonna take faith.

00:27:32.385 --> 00:27:35.505
And the reason why is because just because
you did something once doesn't mean it's

00:27:35.505 --> 00:27:37.305
easier to do it again and even more.

00:27:37.875 --> 00:27:40.170
Um, and so, because if I know
that, I know it's a year of faith.

00:27:40.515 --> 00:27:44.595
And so I believe God is calling
us deeper into a year of faith.

00:27:44.595 --> 00:27:47.505
And again, as a church, we
technically, if we've launched

00:27:47.505 --> 00:27:48.675
almost two years ago, right?

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.095
In, in April, we have launched
two years ago, but we've been

00:27:52.095 --> 00:27:53.385
here as a family for three years.

00:27:53.385 --> 00:27:54.405
We celebrated three years.

00:27:54.885 --> 00:27:59.295
And usually this is what churches and our
church plants and pastors are thinking.

00:27:59.295 --> 00:28:00.015
I want you guys to know this.

00:28:00.015 --> 00:28:02.055
This is what churches and pastors
are thinking at year three.

00:28:02.325 --> 00:28:05.235
So you can get into, to my head and
maybe even some things that you're

00:28:05.235 --> 00:28:08.565
thinking is number one, they're
usually saying, are we gonna make it.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.010
Like, are, are we actually gonna make it?

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.620
Is this thing gonna
gonna figure its way out?

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.389
And, and I believe it is.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.080
Number two, the question that we
usually ask as church planners is, are

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.850
we ever going to be self-sustaining?

00:28:20.879 --> 00:28:24.629
Because you guys saw that $80,000
is internally $150,000 that are

00:28:24.629 --> 00:28:25.889
we ever gonna be self-sustaining?

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.570
Uh, that's a good question.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:28.379
God knows that one.

00:28:28.709 --> 00:28:31.469
Um, and then the last one is,
and this is one of the big ones.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.669
Um, are we, those who are in the church
or even in myself, are we always gonna

00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:37.290
wear five different hats on Sunday?

00:28:37.709 --> 00:28:39.030
And let me explain this.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:43.560
So I'm set up Team Taron, team, I'm
parking team, I am Next Steps team.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.149
And I'm also preaching on Sundays.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.620
I love it by the way.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.020
And I probably won't change much
of that over time because I love

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.070
being a part of those ministries.

00:28:50.459 --> 00:28:54.149
But at some point we start asking
this question, are we always gonna

00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:55.320
serve in five different roles?

00:28:55.949 --> 00:28:58.139
And here's those who have been
serving in five different roles.

00:28:58.169 --> 00:28:59.429
Here's my encouragement to you.

00:28:59.639 --> 00:29:00.300
Keep it up.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:01.979
Uh, but not always.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:02.860
You wanna know why?

00:29:04.065 --> 00:29:08.055
Because God has brought more people and
God will bring more people to be a part

00:29:08.055 --> 00:29:09.975
of the mission, not because they have to.

00:29:09.975 --> 00:29:12.525
And I, I wanna be as clear as
I can when it comes to giving.

00:29:12.525 --> 00:29:13.485
When it comes to serving.

00:29:13.905 --> 00:29:17.205
If you feel an obligation and it's
like, oh, I have to do this, you

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.125
have the wrong heart and you're
not hearing what I'm saying.

00:29:19.155 --> 00:29:21.825
I want you to desire to be
a part of what God's doing.

00:29:22.335 --> 00:29:27.015
I want you to desire to give because
that God is doing something so

00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:30.705
amazing, not because the pastor told
me to, or I feel like I have to.

00:29:30.915 --> 00:29:33.465
I'm telling you the moment that you
feel that way, you have the wrong heart.

00:29:33.615 --> 00:29:34.875
And that's not the desire I have.

00:29:35.385 --> 00:29:37.935
That's not the desire our church
has, our church desires for you to

00:29:37.935 --> 00:29:42.795
be a part of and desire to be a part
of serving and giving and being a

00:29:42.795 --> 00:29:46.515
part of, hopefully removing some of
those hats that we've talked about.

00:29:46.965 --> 00:29:51.525
So here's my faith statements, because
guys, I'm, if you know my, my, my,

00:29:51.735 --> 00:29:55.905
if you know me or if you talk to
my wife, I usually say, I hope so.

00:29:56.985 --> 00:29:58.005
And I really hope.

00:29:58.665 --> 00:30:00.885
I don't have to serve
in five roles this year.

00:30:00.945 --> 00:30:04.695
At the end of the year, I hope that we,
and I, I wanna change that this year.

00:30:04.965 --> 00:30:06.405
Does, is anybody pessimistic?

00:30:06.945 --> 00:30:07.935
I'm maybe the only one.

00:30:07.935 --> 00:30:08.115
Okay.

00:30:08.115 --> 00:30:09.885
We have a couple of us
in here that'll admit it.

00:30:10.365 --> 00:30:13.455
Does anybody like seeing the glass
half empty of every situation?

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:15.075
I just, I just see it.

00:30:15.315 --> 00:30:16.095
You tell me.

00:30:16.245 --> 00:30:17.115
It's like guaranteed.

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:18.405
I'm like, well, yes, sir.

00:30:18.405 --> 00:30:19.335
I think it could be.

00:30:19.365 --> 00:30:19.695
Okay.

00:30:20.115 --> 00:30:21.525
So I wanna change.

00:30:22.545 --> 00:30:29.295
I'm, I wanna change, I wanna start
making faith statements, believing God

00:30:29.355 --> 00:30:31.455
completely and trusting him completely.

00:30:31.695 --> 00:30:33.375
So here's how I would
answer those questions.

00:30:33.375 --> 00:30:34.125
Are we gonna make it?

00:30:34.155 --> 00:30:34.665
Yes.

00:30:34.935 --> 00:30:36.555
God has planted this church, not us.

00:30:36.735 --> 00:30:38.355
God has planted this church.

00:30:38.385 --> 00:30:41.595
And if every time I re I'm remind
myself of this, it's not about me.

00:30:42.525 --> 00:30:44.925
It's about like I, I have an
obedience part of it and I have a

00:30:44.925 --> 00:30:46.185
role in it, but it is not about me.

00:30:46.185 --> 00:30:47.115
It's about Jesus.

00:30:47.325 --> 00:30:48.885
So yes, we will.

00:30:48.885 --> 00:30:51.405
Number two, are we gonna
make it financially?

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:52.875
Are we ever gonna be self-sustaining?

00:30:53.325 --> 00:30:53.715
Yes.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.225
You wanna know why?

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.290
Because number one, God has called
this church, each one of you in this

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.149
room to be a part of giving generously.

00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:01.500
And I've seen so many of you do that.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.770
And I believe God will continue to
encourage you and many others that

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:08.580
join us to continue to help us reach
and serve our community financially.

00:31:09.179 --> 00:31:12.689
Number three, the last one, right
are, are we ever gonna get to a point

00:31:12.695 --> 00:31:15.300
where I don't wear five hats, or
all of us don't wear five hats on?

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.770
And the answer is yes.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:17.429
Wanna know why?

00:31:17.939 --> 00:31:21.480
Because the laborers in the harvest,
the labor, I mean, it's biblical.

00:31:21.689 --> 00:31:22.470
He talks about that.

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:25.590
Those who go out and reach other
people, he says the laborers are

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:26.610
in the harvest, which means this.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:30.480
Some of you are part of the harvest,
some of you have joined Inspiring Hope

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:35.310
new, and you're part of fulfilling the
roles to help some of us not serve in

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.850
five different areas and to be able
to fulfill the mission to reach people

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:42.240
and fill and discover God's purpose
for your life through that role.

00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:45.510
But there's going to be more people
that we reach to be able to do.

00:31:46.575 --> 00:31:47.805
So I wanna give you guys some examples.

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:50.685
Some of you probably wondering, are we
ever gonna get into the word of God?

00:31:50.955 --> 00:31:51.284
Yes.

00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:51.855
Here you go.

00:31:51.855 --> 00:31:52.995
Here's here it is.

00:31:53.295 --> 00:31:55.995
I want us see you guys to
turn to Genesis chapter 12.

00:31:56.835 --> 00:31:58.125
Genesis chapter 12.

00:31:58.425 --> 00:32:01.034
And we're gonna look at, at, I'm
gonna, I'm probably just gonna read

00:32:01.034 --> 00:32:02.504
two of 'em for the sake of time.

00:32:03.795 --> 00:32:09.495
Um, but I wanna give you the story of
Abraham because I think Abraham is a

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:14.205
great reminder of faith, um, because
he had to have faith for a while.

00:32:15.825 --> 00:32:21.375
So in Genesis chapter 12, here's what
it says here in verses one through four.

00:32:21.379 --> 00:32:23.445
I'm gonna read this short
verses one through four.

00:32:23.805 --> 00:32:25.034
I think we may have it up on the screen.

00:32:25.034 --> 00:32:26.925
If we don't, I'll just read it to you.

00:32:28.034 --> 00:32:28.215
Okay?

00:32:28.215 --> 00:32:34.335
So the Lord said to Abram, go out
from your land, your relatives, and

00:32:34.335 --> 00:32:39.555
your father's house to the land that
I will show you, and I will make

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.034
you a great nation, and I will bless
you and I'll make your name great.

00:32:43.845 --> 00:32:45.135
And you'll be a blessing.

00:32:45.405 --> 00:32:48.705
And I will bless those who bless you
and I will curse anyone who treats

00:32:48.705 --> 00:32:52.935
you with contempt and all the peoples
on earth will be blessed through you.

00:32:53.475 --> 00:32:55.125
So here was Abraham's response.

00:32:55.545 --> 00:32:58.155
So Abram went as the Lord had told him.

00:32:58.755 --> 00:33:00.375
You know what I wrote
down in my Bible in this?

00:33:00.555 --> 00:33:02.115
It's called simple obedience.

00:33:02.775 --> 00:33:07.995
When God gives a command and he
makes a statement, you believe it.

00:33:08.445 --> 00:33:10.365
Simple obedience, simple faith.

00:33:10.935 --> 00:33:11.325
Why?

00:33:11.325 --> 00:33:11.955
Why do I read that?

00:33:11.955 --> 00:33:14.685
Because this is the beginning
of the call of Abraham and he's

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.265
called Abraham at first and later
his name's chained to Abraham.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.775
If you're wondering that, and that's
a longer story, but I believe this,

00:33:20.775 --> 00:33:21.885
I just started looking through this.

00:33:21.885 --> 00:33:25.935
We're experiencing some of God's
promises to Abraham all the

00:33:25.935 --> 00:33:27.375
way back in Genesis chapter 12.

00:33:27.375 --> 00:33:29.145
He says, I'll make you
into a great nation.

00:33:29.445 --> 00:33:32.805
God has taken Abraham and he
is not just the seed, like

00:33:32.805 --> 00:33:33.795
literally we're the lineage.

00:33:33.795 --> 00:33:36.945
Not that because we're not Jews,
but some of you may be, I guess.

00:33:37.005 --> 00:33:40.455
Um, but I, the idea of faith, we.

00:33:41.145 --> 00:33:45.705
Have become a great nation of faith
because of God's promise to Abraham.

00:33:46.335 --> 00:33:49.935
See, God promised Abraham to be
blessed and he says, I'll bless you.

00:33:49.935 --> 00:33:52.875
And again, the term of blessed can
be different for different people.

00:33:52.875 --> 00:33:56.775
But I would say this, that having a
saving relationship through Jesus and

00:33:56.775 --> 00:33:59.595
the forgiveness of my sins and the
opportunity to experience a personal

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.425
relationship with God, I'm blessed.

00:34:01.545 --> 00:34:02.085
I dunno about you guys.

00:34:02.085 --> 00:34:02.655
I'm blessed.

00:34:02.775 --> 00:34:08.385
So now because of Abraham's faith from
Genesis chapter 12, and, and God's

00:34:08.385 --> 00:34:13.245
promise, I'm experiencing Abraham's
faith, I'm experiencing God's promises,

00:34:13.395 --> 00:34:18.585
and I could go on and on and on and
on, uh, just with this specific story.

00:34:18.885 --> 00:34:21.885
And I share all that to
say this guys is, is faith.

00:34:22.905 --> 00:34:25.065
Sometimes it's so simple,
it's just believing.

00:34:25.094 --> 00:34:29.715
God says who he says he is and is
gonna do what he says he's gonna do.

00:34:30.014 --> 00:34:32.775
Let's go ahead and move
into Genesis chapter 15.

00:34:33.495 --> 00:34:35.114
Another part of Abraham's story.

00:34:35.114 --> 00:34:38.984
Genesis chapter 15, and I'm gonna
read verses one through six.

00:34:39.435 --> 00:34:41.834
Um, and this is what it says,
after these events, the word of

00:34:41.834 --> 00:34:43.484
the Lord came to Abram in a vision.

00:34:43.784 --> 00:34:44.520
He says, do not be afraid.

00:34:44.864 --> 00:34:46.514
Abram, I am your shield.

00:34:46.514 --> 00:34:48.435
Your reward will be very great.

00:34:48.884 --> 00:34:53.024
But Abram said, Lord God, what can
you give me since I'm a childless

00:34:53.145 --> 00:34:58.064
and the air of my house as El AAR
of Damascus and Abraham continued?

00:34:58.095 --> 00:35:00.104
Look, you have given me no offspring.

00:35:00.435 --> 00:35:03.314
So a slave born in my
house will be my air.

00:35:03.915 --> 00:35:06.314
And so you see a little bit
of Abraham's doubt, okay?

00:35:06.495 --> 00:35:07.305
Cuz he's got doubt.

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:07.964
We all have doubt.

00:35:07.995 --> 00:35:08.774
He has a little bit of doubt.

00:35:08.779 --> 00:35:10.484
And here's what the word
of the Lord says, said.

00:35:10.515 --> 00:35:12.254
Now the word of the Lord came to him.

00:35:12.674 --> 00:35:14.265
This one will not be your air.

00:35:14.265 --> 00:35:15.464
Speaking of Eli aar.

00:35:16.064 --> 00:35:19.245
Instead, the one who comes from
your own body will be your.

00:35:19.905 --> 00:35:24.375
He took him outside and said to him, look
in the sky and count the stars, and if you

00:35:24.375 --> 00:35:28.425
are able to count them, then he said to
him, your offspring will be that number.

00:35:28.845 --> 00:35:34.275
And Abram believed the Lord and
he credited him as righteousness.

00:35:34.875 --> 00:35:38.385
See, at times we're gonna have doubt
in the midst of our faith, but when

00:35:38.535 --> 00:35:42.405
the Lord spoke again, when we spend
time with the Lord, again, the Lord

00:35:42.405 --> 00:35:49.575
reminds us of his faithfulness and our
our challenge, our our to be able to be

00:35:49.575 --> 00:35:54.255
just like Abram, to believe the Lord and
that be credit to us as righteousness.

00:35:54.735 --> 00:35:56.685
I'm not gonna read the next
section, but I'm gonna summarize

00:35:56.685 --> 00:35:58.065
it in Genesis chapter 22.

00:35:58.065 --> 00:36:00.195
This is the story of Abraham.

00:36:00.435 --> 00:36:04.335
God says to go take Isaac, bring him
up on a mountain and to sacrifice him

00:36:04.335 --> 00:36:06.465
to the Lord, which sounds so horrible.

00:36:07.575 --> 00:36:09.645
Interestingly enough, God
actually sends his own son to

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.505
do that for our sake later on.

00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:14.205
But he challenges Abraham
to do this in this story.

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:15.975
And the reason I'm not reading just a
little bit longer, and I know we're a

00:36:15.975 --> 00:36:17.205
little bit longer on time today, but.

00:36:18.315 --> 00:36:18.855
Abraham.

00:36:19.005 --> 00:36:19.875
Abraham got up.

00:36:19.965 --> 00:36:21.915
The Lord says, take Isaac,
take him up on the hill in Sac.

00:36:21.975 --> 00:36:27.075
And Abraham got up and took his son,
took his son all the way up, lay

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.095
him on the altar, ties him down,
and raises the knife up to kill him.

00:36:32.205 --> 00:36:33.255
And the Lord stops him.

00:36:33.585 --> 00:36:36.195
Now you say, why did God
wait till that last second?

00:36:36.765 --> 00:36:42.255
It was a test, a faith, and God affirmed
his covenant with Abraham in that day.

00:36:42.795 --> 00:36:46.995
There's going to be a test of faith in
our walks, and when I think of this year,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.555
guys, there's going to be a test of faith.

00:36:49.065 --> 00:36:50.265
Is God gonna show up?

00:36:50.895 --> 00:36:51.915
Is God gonna move?

00:36:51.915 --> 00:36:53.055
Is God gonna provide?

00:36:53.055 --> 00:36:54.585
Is God gonna save people
in this community?

00:36:54.585 --> 00:36:56.205
Is God gonna raise up leaders is God?

00:36:56.445 --> 00:37:00.645
And I'm telling you, I'm the best at
asking that question, but I'm learning

00:37:00.645 --> 00:37:02.775
from Abraham to quickly turn to faith.

00:37:04.035 --> 00:37:04.575
To faith.

00:37:04.815 --> 00:37:07.815
And you wanna know why, and,
and this is so important.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.755
I I, I'm probably, yeah, I'm, I'm,
I'm sharing this right on time.

00:37:12.105 --> 00:37:14.205
I don't know where I got this
from, but I've held onto it.

00:37:14.685 --> 00:37:15.765
God's faith.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:20.250
Excuse me, God's faithfulness in
the past gives me confidence of his

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.350
faithfulness today and in the future.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.950
And I'll say this again, God's
faithfulness in the past gives

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:30.855
me confidence of his faithfulness
now and in the future for you and

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:32.580
I, I really wanna sit with you.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.819
I'm not literally sitting, but I, I'll
sit with you in this if you wonder.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.830
God hasn't been faithful
to me in the past.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:38.850
I've been there.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.560
I have been there.

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.959
And you know what I did
early on in my faith?

00:37:43.379 --> 00:37:47.220
I went to the word of God and
I read and I saw Abraham, and I

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:51.750
took Abraham's past, faithfulness,
faith, and God's past faithfulness.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:53.009
And I believed God.

00:37:54.209 --> 00:37:56.399
And I believe because I believed God.

00:37:56.399 --> 00:37:58.140
He accounted to me as righteousness.

00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:01.950
And I begin to experience God
being faithful in my life.

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.580
And then God started writing a story
in my life and then I could look back.

00:38:05.669 --> 00:38:11.069
And God's faithfulness in the past gave
me the confidence to have faith now and

00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:14.790
in the future because God is faithful.

00:38:15.435 --> 00:38:17.504
See that word faith is gonna
be critical to us this year.

00:38:18.285 --> 00:38:22.455
And I believe the story of David is or not
Davids, excuse me, the story of Abraham

00:38:22.455 --> 00:38:24.674
is a critical story to, to reflect on.

00:38:24.674 --> 00:38:28.455
And it just reminded me as I
was in the word of God, to think

00:38:28.455 --> 00:38:30.285
about this and to remember this.

00:38:31.095 --> 00:38:34.395
And if this statement is true, that that,
God, I want you to think about this.

00:38:34.395 --> 00:38:39.584
If God cares more about the success of
reaching this community than we do, then

00:38:39.584 --> 00:38:42.615
why do we worry or stress about what
God's doing and what God's not doing?

00:38:42.674 --> 00:38:45.044
I, I'm, maybe I'm speaking to myself
and I just need to turn and preach to

00:38:45.049 --> 00:38:50.504
myself, but there's times where we wonder
what God's doing in our lives, but God

00:38:50.509 --> 00:38:52.694
cares more about your life than you do.

00:38:52.694 --> 00:38:53.174
Why?

00:38:53.475 --> 00:38:55.035
Because you are so precious.

00:38:55.035 --> 00:38:57.044
He was willing to send his
son to die in your place.

00:38:57.794 --> 00:39:00.674
So God cares about whatever circumstance
you're walking through, whatever

00:39:00.674 --> 00:39:06.765
financial situation, whatever
relationship issue, God cares about you.

00:39:06.794 --> 00:39:08.174
He cares more about that situation.

00:39:08.234 --> 00:39:11.294
I think maybe somebody needed
to hear that today and, and

00:39:11.294 --> 00:39:12.435
you're maybe struggling and.

00:39:13.154 --> 00:39:17.115
Maybe you need to hang on to Abraham's
story and say, God was faithful to

00:39:17.115 --> 00:39:21.015
Abraham, and if he was faithful to
Abraham, he'll be faithful to me now and

00:39:21.015 --> 00:39:22.305
he'll be faithful to me in the future.

00:39:22.424 --> 00:39:24.975
And then God will start building
your story and you'll start

00:39:24.975 --> 00:39:26.654
being able to claim that as well.

00:39:27.734 --> 00:39:31.245
So I think it's important to
remember that word, faith this year.

00:39:31.245 --> 00:39:34.935
I think it's important to remember
all that God did last year, but

00:39:34.935 --> 00:39:36.225
here's how we're gonna end today.

00:39:36.524 --> 00:39:39.975
What do we believe God is leading
us to do this year as a church?

00:39:40.035 --> 00:39:43.575
As a church I, I've said this, our
mission is to inspire hope by helping

00:39:43.575 --> 00:39:46.785
people discover God's purpose for their
life through a relationship with Jesus.

00:39:46.785 --> 00:39:51.915
We believe every single person in this
room and in our community has a purpose

00:39:52.395 --> 00:39:54.674
divinely from God to know him personally.

00:39:55.335 --> 00:39:56.595
That's the simple part of it.

00:39:57.285 --> 00:39:59.955
God desires to have a relationship
with every single person.

00:39:59.955 --> 00:40:03.435
He desires that and he desires as
they experience that relationship.

00:40:03.435 --> 00:40:07.365
As you experience a relationship with
Jesus, that you will fulfill your purpose

00:40:07.365 --> 00:40:12.375
by serving and giving in a community of
people so that they can experience Jesus.

00:40:13.095 --> 00:40:14.145
That's our mission.

00:40:14.384 --> 00:40:15.585
So how do we fulfill our mission?

00:40:15.585 --> 00:40:17.535
Here's the cool part about
how we fulfill our mission.

00:40:17.775 --> 00:40:18.735
We have it over here.

00:40:18.735 --> 00:40:19.365
We talk about it.

00:40:19.365 --> 00:40:21.090
We follow live, serve, it,
expand, we follow Jesus.

00:40:21.435 --> 00:40:22.335
We live in community.

00:40:22.455 --> 00:40:25.634
We serve those around us, and we
ultimately expand God's kingdom.

00:40:25.634 --> 00:40:28.485
And I'm gonna give you some
things for this year that we're

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:29.745
gonna be focusing on as a church.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.475
Number one, we're gonna focus on
following Jesus as a, as a whole church.

00:40:32.924 --> 00:40:34.305
Um, cool part here.

00:40:34.634 --> 00:40:38.475
Um, Emily and Derek were talking to me
one day and mentioned this Bible app.

00:40:38.745 --> 00:40:40.725
Uh, and they said, Hey, you should
just look at this Bible app.

00:40:40.725 --> 00:40:41.115
It's great.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.404
They think they did it their last church.

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:43.695
And I was like, okay, I'll look into it.

00:40:44.025 --> 00:40:46.275
I started going through that
and guys, just so you know,

00:40:46.665 --> 00:40:47.775
I think it's divine by God.

00:40:47.955 --> 00:40:50.235
I started going through that in
December, cuz normally it's annually.

00:40:50.654 --> 00:40:53.325
And I got into Genesis and I was blown up.

00:40:53.325 --> 00:40:54.555
Like, I was like, oh my gosh.

00:40:54.555 --> 00:40:56.895
Like it, it wasn't the Bible
plan, it was just the word of God.

00:40:56.895 --> 00:40:58.065
I was just getting back into Genesis.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.259
And I was seeing these stories again,
it was just building up my faith.

00:41:01.259 --> 00:41:02.580
And I was like, we gotta
use this Bible app.

00:41:03.089 --> 00:41:05.069
So here's, here's what the plan will be.

00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:09.060
I know some of you are faithful followers
of Jesus that has a plan already for

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.490
the year and you're walking through
it with another lady or whatever.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:12.060
Keep doing that.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.680
Another man, if you're doing it, great.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.230
If you don't have anything that you're
intentionally walking through this

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.759
year, I've got something for you.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.060
Um, this app, uh, this app
is the read scripture app.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:24.150
I'll send this out this week so
that you have this in your text

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:25.440
message cuz I text messaged, right?

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.420
You're gonna get it, you're gonna
get a text message about this.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.890
Um, here's what I would hope.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.589
It's, it's a, it's key Bible stories
where you walk through the whole Bible

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.240
with videos from the Bible project.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.200
If you've ever watched the Bible
project videos, you'll love 'em.

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:37.380
They are great.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.460
They help summarize the Bible.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.589
They help pull out different
things in the story.

00:41:40.589 --> 00:41:43.470
It helps you understand what's going
on if you're lost a lot like me.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:43.950
Okay?

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.470
Um, and so it walks through
pretty consistently.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.569
Um, and it's been amazing since
I've been walking through it.

00:41:48.575 --> 00:41:49.500
So I'm gonna send that out to you.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.935
And my hope is, is that those of
you who aren't in plans, We'll reply

00:41:52.935 --> 00:41:54.765
back and say, Hey, I'm gonna do this.

00:41:54.855 --> 00:41:57.015
That lets me know who's gonna do
it, and then I want to connect you

00:41:57.015 --> 00:41:57.944
with somebody else that's doing it.

00:41:57.944 --> 00:42:00.524
And you guys can walk through it
together and encourage each other.

00:42:00.524 --> 00:42:03.194
You may not be on the same day, but
you're gonna be disconnecting and

00:42:03.194 --> 00:42:04.365
saying, Hey, I'm walking through this.

00:42:04.365 --> 00:42:05.085
I'm walking through this.

00:42:05.355 --> 00:42:07.214
Um, and if it's you
and your spouse, great.

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.055
That can be you too.

00:42:08.205 --> 00:42:12.285
But I want our people to be in the
word, go in the word and, and let

00:42:12.285 --> 00:42:15.404
me, let me share this, and I wanna
be as, as clear as I possibly can.

00:42:16.185 --> 00:42:20.924
God reminded me as I was in the word
that if, if anything's gonna happen in

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:29.384
this year, it will not be from just me
telling about a lot of good things or

00:42:29.384 --> 00:42:30.785
about us doing a lot of good things.

00:42:31.575 --> 00:42:34.935
It's gonna be about each one of you
being transformed, formed by the word

00:42:34.935 --> 00:42:38.024
of God through a relationship with God.

00:42:38.564 --> 00:42:39.884
And so God convicted me about that.

00:42:40.004 --> 00:42:44.265
The number one thing that I wanna
see in our church is that you're in

00:42:44.265 --> 00:42:46.904
the word and that you know Jesus.

00:42:46.904 --> 00:42:49.515
And if that happens, everything
else will take care of itself.

00:42:50.384 --> 00:42:51.645
Everything else to take care of itself.

00:42:51.795 --> 00:42:52.455
God reminded me.

00:42:52.455 --> 00:42:54.615
It's not about me, it's about him.

00:42:55.065 --> 00:42:55.725
It's about his word.

00:42:55.725 --> 00:42:57.195
So we're going to prioritize the word.

00:42:57.195 --> 00:42:58.575
We're gonna challenge
you to get in the word.

00:42:58.785 --> 00:43:01.845
If you're already in the word with
another plan, I'm just gonna praise

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:03.045
God and say, Hey, keep going.

00:43:03.045 --> 00:43:05.865
But if you aren't, we're gonna go through
this together as those who aren't right.

00:43:06.165 --> 00:43:09.915
So my desire is to see you guys
grow in your faith, um, with that.

00:43:10.215 --> 00:43:14.295
Um, number two, we're
going to live in community.

00:43:14.384 --> 00:43:15.915
What we already talked
about, living community.

00:43:15.915 --> 00:43:19.425
Well, here's what you guys may know
or may not know in this past year.

00:43:19.755 --> 00:43:22.845
We love inspire groups and we've tried
to start some new inspire groups and

00:43:22.845 --> 00:43:25.605
we're trying to figure this thing out,
which means we're trying to live life

00:43:25.605 --> 00:43:29.415
outside the church during the week, and
it's just not working the greatest way.

00:43:29.415 --> 00:43:32.115
We were hoping to, and we're still trying
to figure this out, we're not giving up on

00:43:32.115 --> 00:43:33.585
inspired groups, but here's what I know.

00:43:33.915 --> 00:43:37.185
We are going to continue
to prioritize groups.

00:43:38.234 --> 00:43:38.895
Community.

00:43:39.525 --> 00:43:42.875
And, uh, one of those is, uh, me and
Brittany are really, uh, considering

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:47.444
moving our group on a Sunday afternoon
slash early evening so that young

00:43:47.444 --> 00:43:52.035
families can come on a Sunday and get
home before bedtime and mealtime, um,

00:43:52.035 --> 00:43:55.665
and, and have some childcare so that
you guys can come and do that rather

00:43:55.665 --> 00:43:57.615
than during the week when life's chaos.

00:43:57.944 --> 00:44:00.734
Um, that may be one way, but if
that's not the only way we have things

00:44:00.734 --> 00:44:02.265
like Elise's in a, in aship group.

00:44:02.505 --> 00:44:03.075
Praise God.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.185
She is discipling some ladies.

00:44:04.185 --> 00:44:06.795
I went to Panera to have a
meeting on Wednesday and I saw

00:44:06.795 --> 00:44:09.404
her over there with the, the her
two ladies just pour into them.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:10.605
And I'm just like, I'm celebrating.

00:44:10.605 --> 00:44:11.775
I'm like, oh, this is so great.

00:44:11.895 --> 00:44:12.765
That's community.

00:44:13.065 --> 00:44:14.685
I wanna see more groups like that.

00:44:14.714 --> 00:44:18.855
And so the challenges here is to
help you get connected to each

00:44:18.855 --> 00:44:20.505
other throughout the week somehow.

00:44:20.984 --> 00:44:23.865
Guys, we can't just come on a
Sunday and think that's good enough.

00:44:23.924 --> 00:44:25.665
It it, it's not, it's not good enough.

00:44:25.694 --> 00:44:27.765
I, I wanna know you more and
I hope you wanna know me more.

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:29.595
I need your relationships as well.

00:44:29.835 --> 00:44:34.424
So we're gonna focus on trying to make
that a continued priority in our church.

00:44:35.025 --> 00:44:36.045
Uh, number two.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.780
Serving, you're, you're
gonna love this one.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.200
Ready?

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.730
This one's a little bit unique.

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:43.950
I'm gonna slow down a little bit
cause I've been talking fast.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:46.440
We're gonna serve different this year.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:48.240
We're gonna keep doing
what we've been doing.

00:44:48.245 --> 00:44:54.210
But God has placed on MINDBODY's heart and
I know several other people's hearts, um,

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:55.800
that he has called us to this community.

00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:00.300
Um, because there are, there
is a next generation to reach.

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.870
We believe God called us to the schools
to minister in through the schools, to

00:45:03.875 --> 00:45:08.430
provide afterschool programs to connect
with, with teenagers and, and these

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:12.420
young kids, which means this, we have a
great children's ministry, by the way.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.910
Thank you Laura and
children's ministry team.

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:15.660
You guys do great.

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:18.180
Um, and we are trying to figure
out our, our youth ministry.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.870
I know Elisa and Riley and a couple
others have been involved in trying to

00:45:21.875 --> 00:45:23.100
get this youth ministry figured out.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.700
Um, God, God has called us to reach
the next generation, and I believe

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.860
we need to focus on student ministry.

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.640
I, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna be
honest with you, in serving.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.669
Which means this, in order to
serve our community, we, we need

00:45:35.669 --> 00:45:39.770
to reach the students and we need
to provide good biblical teaching

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:42.720
and mentorship in our community.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:43.529
We just need to do it.

00:45:44.759 --> 00:45:47.220
I don't have a plan, so as
a pastor staying up here,

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.299
I'm not coming with a plan.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.759
Here's what me and Brittany have
committed to, and I'm gonna pray

00:45:50.765 --> 00:45:57.180
for you guys to commit to pray, pray
that God reveals to our church how

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.439
we take the next step in that area.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:03.089
I, I don't think it's a, you
know, if we get around to it, I

00:46:03.095 --> 00:46:04.740
think it needs to be a priority.

00:46:04.919 --> 00:46:10.259
God has called us here to reach the next
generation, and, and if he has, then he's

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:11.759
gonna provide a way for us to do that.

00:46:12.149 --> 00:46:15.540
And I'm ready to put it on in faith
to say, all right, Lord, show us.

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:20.069
But we need to prioritize it and, and that
may be you, somebody sitting in a seat.

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:22.500
That may be somebody that God
brings outside of our church.

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:23.549
I don't know.

00:46:23.555 --> 00:46:26.790
That may be a group of people that
step up and I know we've already had a

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:29.339
group of people that are doing a great
job and I want to knock that at all.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.919
I think we've been doing what we
can and I think we wanna do more.

00:46:32.415 --> 00:46:35.085
Not only for our students, but
for our community students.

00:46:35.265 --> 00:46:38.895
So our vision for this year is to
begin to pray for that specifically

00:46:38.985 --> 00:46:41.925
how God would reveal how we
meet that need in our community.

00:46:41.925 --> 00:46:44.055
So that is a serving
opportunities, I believe.

00:46:44.595 --> 00:46:46.275
Number two, expand.

00:46:46.995 --> 00:46:51.195
Um, we have a desire to develop
leaders and to empower leaders.

00:46:51.195 --> 00:46:53.895
And when we think about expanding,
expanding God's kingdom to by, you

00:46:53.895 --> 00:46:56.805
know, developing disciples, groups
and churches, we've talked a lot about

00:46:56.805 --> 00:46:59.295
that, but I think leaders should be
a part of that statement as well.

00:46:59.475 --> 00:47:02.715
Last year we talked about leadership
development, like, and, and we've

00:47:02.715 --> 00:47:04.575
done a little bit of that and we
wanna continue to do that, but

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.585
this year's leadership empowerment.

00:47:06.915 --> 00:47:09.645
Um, one of the ways that we've done
that is just to kind of, uh, let you

00:47:09.645 --> 00:47:11.535
guys know official capacity this year.

00:47:11.895 --> 00:47:14.565
Uh, Laura has moved into an official
capacity as a children's director.

00:47:14.565 --> 00:47:16.185
You may say, well, isn't she
already functioning that?

00:47:16.185 --> 00:47:16.755
Yes.

00:47:17.175 --> 00:47:21.105
Um, she's just coming on staff as
part-time to do that, um, which is great.

00:47:21.165 --> 00:47:22.095
We're super excited about.

00:47:23.069 --> 00:47:26.609
Number two, Matt is coming on as
our music and media director, uh,

00:47:26.609 --> 00:47:28.560
officially on staff as part-time as well.

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:30.839
So in leadership, empowerment
means they're going to

00:47:30.839 --> 00:47:32.040
have a more important role.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.470
They've already been doing an amazing
job in the role, but to continue

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:37.350
to step into that role more and
to help lead this church forward.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:41.399
Um, a couple other things that
happen is we as a church run, I

00:47:41.399 --> 00:47:43.890
know this is going long, guys, but
I'm trying to help you just really

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:45.060
engage with who we are as a church.

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:49.140
But we have a board that oversees
the activities of our church.

00:47:49.319 --> 00:47:52.649
Um, and uh, this board was
composed of five different guys.

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:54.899
Um, three of them were from Oklahoma.

00:47:55.995 --> 00:47:57.225
Two of 'em were actually from Oklahoma.

00:47:57.225 --> 00:47:58.515
One was here with us.

00:47:58.905 --> 00:48:02.745
Um, and then we had two other pastors,
um, two of those guys we have asked.

00:48:02.745 --> 00:48:06.015
Um, cause they've served their time
to go ahead and, and step down and

00:48:06.015 --> 00:48:08.745
move on because it's time to start
adding some of our own people.

00:48:08.775 --> 00:48:14.865
So we have added Orville and Matt onto
our board to help us oversee our church.

00:48:14.865 --> 00:48:17.025
And what that means is they hold
me accountable in everything we

00:48:17.025 --> 00:48:19.665
do from a finance standpoint to
big decisions, things like that.

00:48:20.025 --> 00:48:23.685
Um, and, and that makes sure that
we have a good structure long term.

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:24.585
What's our role with that?

00:48:24.615 --> 00:48:28.815
That board will turn into an elder board
where we will have multiple, um, men

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:33.675
helping lead this church as a whole, and
we're working that direction over time.

00:48:33.675 --> 00:48:36.375
And so those are some
leadership empowerment.

00:48:36.405 --> 00:48:37.875
But you may ask this question.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.815
Is those the only things that were like,
it's the only way you can be empowered?

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:47.895
No, actually, um, as a volunteer, as
a, as a, as a, as a member of this

00:48:47.895 --> 00:48:52.065
church, I want to, I wanna do the
best I can to get out of the way.

00:48:53.115 --> 00:48:57.900
Um, I'm just telling you, I half
the things I do probably throughout

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.450
the week, I don't need to be
doing, I'm not good at doing them.

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:02.220
Uh, and that's social media posting.

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.110
I'm just not even remembering
to do any of that.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:08.910
But we need to continue to empower
leaders in this church to take on roles

00:49:08.915 --> 00:49:12.060
to fulfill, and it doesn't necessarily
have to be on staff, but just to fulfill

00:49:12.065 --> 00:49:13.680
the ministry that God has called us to.

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:16.890
Um, and we're even, uh, one of the things
I don't think I've mentioned publicly,

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:21.540
but um, Elisa has stepped down from
Ministry assistant because she is getting

00:49:21.545 --> 00:49:24.150
ready to have a baby and she's been
focusing on her kids' school, which I'm

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:26.160
so thankful for her time in serving that.

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:30.330
But that's left a void where we need a
ministry assistant about 10 hours a week.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:33.360
And so if somebody in this room saying,
Hey, I'd love to be a part, a ministry

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.030
assistant, you know, let me know and
we can talk a little bit about that.

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:37.500
Um, maybe an opportunity for you.

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.450
But we're praying that
God provides that role as.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:43.380
And so I say all that to say is
we want to continue to empower

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:47.760
leaders because this church is
more than just me doing everything.

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.260
And it's become more than that.

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:53.070
But now it's even seen now empowering
people to serve alongside me on the staff,

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:54.690
which is gonna be a huge thing as well.

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:56.310
So I'm excited about that.

00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:59.070
Um, and so just a couple
of last things here.

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:03.030
Going back to our focus on ministry,
the simple and clearly defined,

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.630
um, ministry is we're, we're trying
to put some systems and structures

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:09.570
together for our next steps, and
Amanda's been helping with that.

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:11.820
And there'll be more to share with
that, but we're trying to focus

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.010
on that internally as a church.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.550
But our mission field has changed, and
that's the one I want to end on today.

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:18.750
Our mission field has changed.

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.930
We are officially moving
out of this space.

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:26.070
Next Sunday, we will have a
service, uh, a condensed service.

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.330
We'll pack up and we'll move
everything to the Y M C A and the 22nd.

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:33.780
We will officially meet there, um,
of this month, which may sound quick.

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:36.060
You've been hearing it for
a while, but we are moving.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.940
And what that means is it's not about
a, just a different place to meet.

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:44.069
But it's a mission field, and I believe
God's brought us to this mission field

00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:46.439
for a specific time and opportunity.

00:50:46.859 --> 00:50:50.129
Um, and I think that God is gonna open
up opportunities for us to connect with

00:50:50.129 --> 00:50:54.209
new people, uh, to meet with new people
in, in the pub this public space, serve

00:50:54.209 --> 00:50:55.680
the community partner alongside them.

00:50:56.100 --> 00:51:00.120
Um, I've already had probably seven
to 10 gospel conversations just going

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.370
in and out of there to talk with
the staff about different things.

00:51:02.669 --> 00:51:05.730
I've had two other, their staff that
don't even go to churches that have said,

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:09.540
you know, we may come, um, now that it's
in the y and like, I'm already seeing

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.060
that just from initial discussions.

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:16.080
So I believe we're gonna be able to
reach more people, um, through this.

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:19.259
But here's what I know and I, I wanna
make a couple of statements and I

00:51:19.259 --> 00:51:20.250
wanna hand something out to you.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:26.700
If we go into the Y M C A and our current
volunteer base continues to serve the

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:30.419
way we've been serving here, we won't be
able to serve well at, at the Y M C A.

00:51:30.959 --> 00:51:32.730
Uh, and I'm not guilting anybody in this.

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:34.859
I'm just really encouraging you.

00:51:35.564 --> 00:51:37.214
To ask the Lord how you
can be a part of this.

00:51:37.634 --> 00:51:40.875
Um, I, I, I'm, I'm gonna make
this statement as, as nicely

00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:42.194
and as straightforward as I can.

00:51:47.265 --> 00:51:52.875
Being a part of an inspiring hope
is not meant to be a spectator.

00:51:53.834 --> 00:51:56.625
If you're new here, that's
a perfect time to figure out

00:51:56.629 --> 00:51:57.854
if this is the place for you.

00:51:58.214 --> 00:52:02.205
But the moment that you say, I h c is
your home, it's time to get involved.

00:52:02.865 --> 00:52:04.064
And I don't want to guilt you in that.

00:52:04.064 --> 00:52:05.084
That's not what I'm saying.

00:52:05.564 --> 00:52:08.174
But there's somewhere that you can
be a part of what God's doing here.

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:09.734
I'm, we just celebrated all that.

00:52:09.734 --> 00:52:10.305
God did.

00:52:10.995 --> 00:52:13.814
There's some way that you can serve
on a Sunday, once, once a month.

00:52:14.924 --> 00:52:15.435
I'm just telling you.

00:52:15.435 --> 00:52:16.305
There, there is.

00:52:16.484 --> 00:52:19.125
And, and, and, and I, I, we kind of
talked about this a couple months

00:52:19.125 --> 00:52:22.455
ago at our family meeting, but I'm
really just gonna challenge you to

00:52:22.915 --> 00:52:24.615
actually say, no, I'm in, I'm in.

00:52:24.705 --> 00:52:26.265
And then we can, we can talk about it.

00:52:26.265 --> 00:52:29.625
There's things like parking, um, there's
things like greeting, there's things like

00:52:29.625 --> 00:52:33.524
next steps or cafe or music and helping
with tech, and they can train you on that.

00:52:33.524 --> 00:52:33.825
There's.

00:52:34.964 --> 00:52:37.125
Lots of even things where we're
gonna talk about following up with

00:52:37.245 --> 00:52:38.415
family members during the week.

00:52:38.415 --> 00:52:40.424
And there, there's so many opportunities.

00:52:40.424 --> 00:52:42.854
And so I'm, I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna continue to talk as,

00:52:43.125 --> 00:52:44.475
as Alisa passes this around.

00:52:44.955 --> 00:52:50.205
Here's just an opportunity for you
today, um, to see opportunities

00:52:50.209 --> 00:52:54.915
and places to serve, to write
your name on it, check market.

00:52:54.915 --> 00:52:56.294
Put how many times
you're willing to serve.

00:52:56.354 --> 00:52:56.865
And here's the thing.

00:52:56.865 --> 00:52:57.944
You can check Mark all of them.

00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:59.955
It doesn't mean you're gonna be
committed to all of them, but here's

00:52:59.955 --> 00:53:04.785
what it would say is that you're putting
your yes on the table to consider the

00:53:04.785 --> 00:53:06.104
opportunity to serve in this role.

00:53:06.825 --> 00:53:09.314
And, and I, the reason why I say that
is, is so many times you guys are

00:53:09.319 --> 00:53:10.334
like, but I don't know all the details.

00:53:10.334 --> 00:53:13.754
And that's great cuz I can't stand
up here another hour and explain

00:53:13.754 --> 00:53:15.015
all the details of those ministries.

00:53:15.015 --> 00:53:20.504
But if you're willing to c consider
that opportunity, then we follow up

00:53:20.509 --> 00:53:21.975
and say, what does that look like?

00:53:22.334 --> 00:53:22.544
You know?

00:53:22.544 --> 00:53:24.825
And you may say, well,
tell me more about it.

00:53:24.825 --> 00:53:26.714
And then you go, you know,
that's not my gifting.

00:53:26.785 --> 00:53:29.415
I, I, I'm telling you, there's
certain people in here I already know.

00:53:29.415 --> 00:53:30.975
There's certain people in
here that says, if you put me

00:53:30.975 --> 00:53:32.654
with kids, they would hate me.

00:53:33.045 --> 00:53:37.455
I don't want you in kids, but you
may be great in the back clicking

00:53:37.455 --> 00:53:40.485
slides next because you're not
gonna make the computer angry.

00:53:41.265 --> 00:53:41.505
Okay?

00:53:41.595 --> 00:53:43.995
That may be you, but we need
some more roles in that.

00:53:44.025 --> 00:53:44.205
Okay?

00:53:44.205 --> 00:53:47.715
So the, you get where I'm at here,
but, but I say all this to say,

00:53:47.715 --> 00:53:52.275
when we move to the Y M C A, we have
to change our mentality as a hole.

00:53:52.275 --> 00:53:54.555
And if you're watching online,
I'll send you this sheet.

00:53:54.555 --> 00:53:56.685
If you, if they're not here,
I'm gonna send 'em a sheet.

00:53:56.925 --> 00:54:01.605
We need everybody to choose one
place, at least one place there.

00:54:01.725 --> 00:54:05.625
There's somewhere that you could
participate in and help win.

00:54:05.805 --> 00:54:08.745
And again, just mark it
down and then we will talk.

00:54:08.805 --> 00:54:10.515
They're, you're not
signing your life away.

00:54:10.755 --> 00:54:14.385
Um, but I want you to be able to fill
those out before you leave and leave

00:54:14.385 --> 00:54:17.535
them back there at the next steps
table today, because I think this is

00:54:17.535 --> 00:54:19.935
going to be a key part of our church.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.905
And this is, this is really my
challenge as, as a, as a vision

00:54:22.905 --> 00:54:27.345
of church, moving from a smaller
church to a little bit bigger

00:54:27.345 --> 00:54:29.115
church and, and, and moving forward.

00:54:29.955 --> 00:54:31.875
Guys, I've been in your seat.

00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:38.100
This is, this is usually the statements
we would say I'll give when I have money.

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:42.960
I'll serve when I have time and
I'll share when I know enough.

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:45.570
You guys know what I'm
talking about, right?

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.970
Because we never have enough money
and we never have enough time, and

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.550
we never have enough knowledge to
feel confident to share our faith.

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:55.440
I've been there, I've told myself
that there many times we need to

00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:57.330
change those statements to this.

00:54:57.779 --> 00:55:01.500
I will give now because God has blessed
me with what I have, and I'll give what

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:08.550
I have I'll serve now because I want
to prioritize the mission of God over

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:11.700
something else, which means this, you
may have to say no to something else in

00:55:11.705 --> 00:55:15.540
order to say yes to serving, which means
I'm just telling, I know it's difficult.

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:20.950
You might have to say no to
sleeping one extra hour and,

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:22.560
and, and I mean, that's tough.

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:24.870
And, and here's another tough one.

00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:28.080
You may have to say no to driving
with your spouse to church once a

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.400
month just to come serve in parking.

00:55:30.945 --> 00:55:31.605
To set up.

00:55:31.725 --> 00:55:37.665
And, and I know that sounds difficult, I
know that sounds difficult, but I'm not

00:55:37.665 --> 00:55:41.985
asking you to do anything that I haven't
committed to doing for three years.

00:55:42.975 --> 00:55:44.685
And, and, and I wanna lead by example.

00:55:44.685 --> 00:55:45.375
And here's the cool part.

00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:49.305
Our leaders in this church have
led by example for the amount

00:55:49.305 --> 00:55:50.085
of years they've been here.

00:55:51.195 --> 00:55:55.095
I want you to serve alongside them and
say, I'm willing to sacrifice some time.

00:55:55.335 --> 00:55:57.705
I'm willing to, to be a part of.

00:55:57.795 --> 00:56:01.125
And here's the cool part, because
you want to be a part of it.

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:03.525
You see this, this is a great opportunity.

00:56:04.515 --> 00:56:10.185
So I, I'm, I know like I I and that person
that hates like disappointing people.

00:56:10.185 --> 00:56:12.705
But I, I don't wanna disappoint God.

00:56:13.545 --> 00:56:17.775
I, I don't, I want to see God get
more and more glory this year.

00:56:18.225 --> 00:56:19.545
And he, and here's the cool part.

00:56:20.145 --> 00:56:23.235
Um, I wouldn't say this just to a full
group of people that I didn't know, but

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:28.785
I know you guys, I believe God has called
you guys here for such a time as this.

00:56:29.279 --> 00:56:32.129
If you're in this room, if you're
watching online, and I'm gonna send

00:56:32.129 --> 00:56:34.379
this video to those who didn't show
up, I'm gonna tell 'em the same thing.

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:34.919
Okay?

00:56:35.549 --> 00:56:39.779
I believe you were here for such
a time as this, and if you don't

00:56:39.779 --> 00:56:41.910
remember the Esther story, you
need to go read the Esther story.

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:43.740
The cool thing that's
in the book of Esther.

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:44.250
You can find it.

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:45.359
The Esther story.

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:50.520
Mordecai's reminding her as she's in this
position as queen, the Save the Jews from

00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:52.740
destruction, from dying, being massacred.

00:56:53.189 --> 00:56:54.480
He says, look around you.

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:57.600
Your position has given you
opportunity, but there's risk

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:01.649
involved, and she didn't wanna risk
her life to save the lives of many.

00:57:03.569 --> 00:57:09.660
Are you willing to risk one hour of
sleep driving separate from your spouse,

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:11.819
you know, one month, a week, whatever.

00:57:11.819 --> 00:57:13.169
Are you willing to risk that?

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:18.839
And that's not much risk to possibly
meet the needs of someone who would

00:57:18.845 --> 00:57:20.970
attend our church and come to know Jesus.

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.660
I'm trying to break this down for you.

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:24.899
Here.

00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:28.140
God's word is good and it
reminds me of these things.

00:57:29.384 --> 00:57:33.285
So as we take some time for
Invitation, God's inviting us to

00:57:33.285 --> 00:57:36.765
be a part of this story that he's
writing here at Inspiring Hope.

00:57:37.005 --> 00:57:40.095
The cool part is you're
here today by choice.

00:57:40.185 --> 00:57:41.205
Maybe it's a text message.

00:57:41.205 --> 00:57:45.884
You're here by choice because
you've said this inspiring hope.

00:57:47.384 --> 00:57:48.255
There's something about it.

00:57:48.259 --> 00:57:52.005
You're here for some reason, and,
and you guys thought through that.

00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:54.134
You're, you're coming
back for some reason.

00:57:54.134 --> 00:57:55.095
You've thought of that.

00:57:56.384 --> 00:58:01.245
I'm challenging you to let that drive you
into being a part of more in this year

00:58:02.025 --> 00:58:08.805
to join the mission, to give, to serve,
to sacrifice, to share so that we can see

00:58:08.805 --> 00:58:13.005
more and more people in our community come
to know Jesus and to grow in their faith.

00:58:14.415 --> 00:58:19.725
And I know that is difficult,
but it is important for us to

00:58:19.725 --> 00:58:22.665
not miss this opportunity that
God has given us as a church.

00:58:22.755 --> 00:58:24.735
So I want you to take time during
an invitation to say yes to.

00:58:25.455 --> 00:58:28.845
May be saying yes to salvation
because here's the thing, don't serve.

00:58:28.984 --> 00:58:30.345
I, I, I'll say that this is this.

00:58:30.345 --> 00:58:31.305
You may say I'm crazy.

00:58:31.725 --> 00:58:34.634
I don't want you serving or giving
before you've given your life to Jesus.

00:58:36.345 --> 00:58:37.575
I don't want you to get out of order.

00:58:38.325 --> 00:58:40.785
I want you to serve and give, but I want
you to give your life to Jesus first

00:58:40.785 --> 00:58:42.765
because guys, what are we doing it for?

00:58:42.794 --> 00:58:45.464
We're doing it because God is so
transform my life to transform your life.

00:58:45.615 --> 00:58:47.774
So do it after you give
your life to Jesus.

00:58:47.774 --> 00:58:49.785
So the first step you need is
to give your life to Jesus.

00:58:49.785 --> 00:58:51.734
And if you haven't done
that, please come talk to me.

00:58:51.734 --> 00:58:52.424
After service.

00:58:52.424 --> 00:58:54.615
I'm gonna be in the back, your
invitation, come talk to me.

00:58:54.944 --> 00:58:56.564
If you have questions about
it and you're still not there

00:58:56.569 --> 00:58:57.734
yet, let's still talk about it.

00:58:58.185 --> 00:58:59.865
But I want you to give your life to Jesus.

00:59:00.435 --> 00:59:03.285
Then I want you to pray for
clarity on where, not if,

00:59:03.345 --> 00:59:05.865
where you will serve in 2023.

00:59:06.375 --> 00:59:09.555
Fill out the sheet during this
time as you're praying, bring

00:59:09.555 --> 00:59:10.875
it back to the next steps table.

00:59:11.325 --> 00:59:13.214
Um, and then I'll follow up with you.

00:59:13.214 --> 00:59:15.825
We may have some other members follow
up with you if, if it's their ministries

00:59:15.825 --> 00:59:19.035
to say, Hey, let's talk about the
next steps to be a part of this.

00:59:19.245 --> 00:59:20.115
Here's what I know.

00:59:20.115 --> 00:59:21.794
This is really where I wanna land.

00:59:21.794 --> 00:59:22.455
Here's what I know.

00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:27.390
God is going to do something
this year through inspiring hope.

00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:31.200
The question is, are you
going to be a part of it?

00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:33.840
And I've been asking that
same question this year.

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:35.370
Am I gonna be a part of it?

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:39.900
If we kept serving and giving
the way we did in 2022 and we do

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:41.640
that in 2023, what will change?

00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:42.660
Were you a part of that?

00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:44.310
Maybe you were, maybe you weren't.

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:45.480
I wanna be a part of it.

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.010
I'm ready to see God move.

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.610
Let's pray.

00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:50.070
Lord Jesus, we thank
you God for this time.

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:54.780
Lord, I know that it maybe is longer than
we had hoped, but Lord Jesus, I just pray

00:59:55.830 --> 00:59:57.600
the Lord the words that we were shared.

00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:05.070
Um, today, Lord, were words that
encouraged, Lord, I pray that these words

01:00:05.070 --> 01:00:07.620
don't feel like I'm trying to guilt trip.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.270
Lord, this is not about guilt tripping.

01:00:09.275 --> 01:00:11.850
This is about encouraging
and believing in people.

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:17.430
God, you have called each person to this,
this place to be a part of the mission.

01:00:18.495 --> 01:00:20.145
To transform lives in our community.

01:00:21.045 --> 01:00:24.015
And, uh, God, you, you
have chose to use us.

01:00:24.015 --> 01:00:28.365
And I think that's the, the thing that's
so humbling is that you have chose to use

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.225
each one of us in this room to do that.

01:00:30.765 --> 01:00:34.065
And because of that, Lord,
I don't wanna waste it.

01:00:34.154 --> 01:00:37.305
And I pray that they don't wanna
waste their lives or the lives we're

01:00:37.335 --> 01:00:39.254
given to them for such a time as this.

01:00:39.525 --> 01:00:45.105
Lord, may we go into this new year on
fire for you first and following you

01:00:45.105 --> 01:00:50.504
personally through being in your word
daily and then finding our place to serve

01:00:50.504 --> 01:00:56.625
and give God, may you give wisdom to those
who are considering what they should do.

01:00:57.375 --> 01:00:59.085
May you challenge them in their faith.

01:00:59.085 --> 01:01:02.595
Lord, may you challenge me and
my faith in my role in this year

01:01:03.045 --> 01:01:06.225
and help me lead well, help our
leaders lead well this year.

01:01:07.245 --> 01:01:08.504
And Lord, I just prayed last thing.

01:01:08.504 --> 01:01:11.924
Lord, if there's someone in this
room that doesn't know you, God, I am

01:01:11.924 --> 01:01:13.964
begging that that person has the faith.

01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:18.150
To come back and talk with me and ask
how they can give their lives to you.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.310
Will we pray this in your heavenly name?

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:21.270
Amen.

01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:22.400
Amen.
