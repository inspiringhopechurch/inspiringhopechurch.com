00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.340
Alright, so, um, we're gonna be in
Ephesians chapter 6, so we've been

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.900
walking through the book of Ephesians
since the beginning of time, I feel

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.070
like, since the beginning of the year.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.529
Um, and we're actually at the
conclusion of it, which is, uh,

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.250
really been one of my favorite parts.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.340
Um, and we're gonna read from verse
10, again Ephesians chapter 6.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.089
We're gonna read from
verse 10 through, um, 17.

00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:49.095
Um, we're gonna be dealing mainly with
verses 14 and 15, um, and, but, to read

00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:55.774
it all in context is so important, um, but
here's what we've been, as we walk through

00:00:55.775 --> 00:01:00.565
this last week and as we even think again
through it today, is everybody, lost or

00:01:00.565 --> 00:01:04.494
saved, knows Jesus, doesn't know Jesus,
is walking through a spiritual battle.

00:01:05.494 --> 00:01:08.945
Um, I think if you ask any.

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:15.274
military, veteran, or current person
serving, and ask this question, Hey,

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:18.434
was there ever a point you didn't
know you were in a war or in a battle?

00:01:18.814 --> 00:01:21.724
And they would probably laugh and
say, Well, no, it's logical, right?

00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:24.895
There's bullets flying at us,
there's bombs, there's people, you

00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:27.304
know, we're seeing them come towards
us, whatever it is, you name it,

00:01:27.784 --> 00:01:29.005
they knew they were in a battle.

00:01:29.634 --> 00:01:34.015
But sometimes as followers of Jesus,
and even those who would not claim

00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:38.804
to be a follower of Jesus, we don't
see the enemy, because the enemy...

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:43.005
What tends to be invisible to this
idea we learned last week is we tend to

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:45.404
think our enemy is each other, people.

00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:48.764
And if you don't believe me, go
on social media and you'll see it.

00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:51.214
You'll see people
bantering back and forth.

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:53.714
Um, you'll see divisions in family.

00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:57.715
Because we find and we think that
our greatest enemy is the person

00:01:57.715 --> 00:01:58.684
on the other side of the screen.

00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:01.304
The person who disagrees with
my opinion and your opinion.

00:02:01.304 --> 00:02:07.250
And the thing we learned last week is
that our enemy, um, Um, is the devil.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.700
He was very clear in
naming that in this text.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.110
And, um, he has schemes, right?

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.800
Um, and so, what we, what we kind of
talked with this week, we're going to talk

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.519
about next week, what we talked about last
week, what we're going to talk about this

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.569
week, what we're going to talk about even
following week, is that we, as believers,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.529
in this battle, fight from victory.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.170
And that idea of fighting
from victory sounds...

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.560
weird.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.960
And maybe the reason why I think
about that is if you were to...

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.800
Take, let's just take last night's game.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.840
Anybody watched the NBA
playoffs last night?

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.770
Great game.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.760
I didn't watch it, saw the highlights.

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:45.250
Um, Milwaukee won, if
anybody wants to know.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.120
They won, like, last second stuff.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.240
If you were to go to one of those teams
and say, Hey, before you step on the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.170
court tonight, you're a guaranteed win.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.360
Guaranteed win.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.450
They'd laugh at you, right?

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.830
Because there's no guarantees
in sports like that, right?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.180
Now, you can have a lot of confidence.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.950
But as a believer, You
have a guaranteed win.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.100
Well, the guaranteed win, though,
is not based upon your strength.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.160
It's based upon God's strength.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.990
And so what we learned last week in
the first, um, four verses of this,

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.699
uh, chapter, three, four verses, um,
is this, is that we have, uh, and I'm

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.090
just going to read the first couple of
verses just to kind of catch us up here.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.630
It says, Finally, and this is
verse 10, Finally be strengthened

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.330
by the Lord and His vast strength.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.695
Um, and so first off, we learned that
As believers, Paul's reminding us to be

00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:39.345
strengthened by the Lord's vast strength,
not just by his strength or his somewhat

00:03:39.355 --> 00:03:43.235
strength or his strengths in these
areas, it's his complete vast strength.

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:46.834
Um, and then it goes on and it
says that it's put on the full

00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:50.145
armor of God so you can stand
against the schemes of the devil.

00:03:50.824 --> 00:03:55.474
So we realize that we have an enemy, um,
and, and this just, it stuck with me, if

00:03:55.474 --> 00:04:01.110
anybody's familiar with Harry Potter, and
you know that, I can't even say it, right?

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.460
He who must not be named.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.120
Well, guess what?

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.990
We can name our enemy.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.270
Paul does.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.930
It's the devil.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.810
Or Satan.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.279
Or, as we're gonna learn, um,
he had many helpers, right?

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.280
Um, he called them rulers and
authorities and cosmic powers.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.790
I think this is in this next verse, right?

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.269
For our struggle is not against flesh
and blood, but against these rulers

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.169
and authorities and against the
cosmic powers and darkness, against

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.180
evil and spiritual forces in heaven.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.730
Um, and so he attacks us
with these schemes, right?

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.360
So what does that mean?

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:32.555
The enemy attacks us with cunning
acts, deceit, trickery, lies.

00:04:33.145 --> 00:04:36.315
Um, if you look at a couple
different words, devil means accuser.

00:04:36.794 --> 00:04:39.065
Satan means adversary to God, right?

00:04:39.115 --> 00:04:40.015
An enemy to God.

00:04:40.534 --> 00:04:43.145
And so we, as believers, have an enemy.

00:04:43.435 --> 00:04:45.954
But even, if you're in this room,
you would say, Hey, I haven't made

00:04:45.955 --> 00:04:47.165
the decision to follow Jesus yet.

00:04:48.385 --> 00:04:49.895
Yes, yes, you have an enemy.

00:04:50.285 --> 00:04:54.035
Um, and he is trying to control your life,
or he is controlling your life, right?

00:04:54.035 --> 00:04:55.775
So, uh, this enemy...

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.280
Reminds us that we are in a battle.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.150
So, if you didn't wake up this morning,
knowing you were in a battle, sorry

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.530
to bring bare bad news, you are.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.240
But it's good to know
that we're in the battle.

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:11.429
If we're gonna be in it, we
better know that we're in it.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.119
And if we're in it, now we
can fight against the enemy.

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:21.500
And if we know that Jesus
wins, He's already won.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.380
He's already conquered the grave.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.310
He's already conquered death.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.900
If we know He's already won, that is
absolutely who I want to fight my battles.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.790
I don't know about you guys.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.740
If I know I'm gonna win every
single battle that I endure, then

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.340
I'm going to be on the right team,
the winning team, which is Jesus.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.390
And so we learned, right, that
we have been given this vast

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.500
strength as the enemy attacks us.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.170
So that's how we will fight our enemy,
um, is with God's vast strength.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.260
And He says His vast strength.

00:05:51.615 --> 00:05:55.455
He even affirms this in verse 13, For this
reason, take up the full armor of God.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:59.355
The full armor of God is what
we will use to defeat our enemy.

00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:03.195
He says, so that you may be able to
resist in the evil day and having

00:06:03.195 --> 00:06:04.945
prepared everything to take your stand.

00:06:06.234 --> 00:06:08.275
So this is something that we
addressed last week and I'll

00:06:08.275 --> 00:06:09.285
continue to affirm this week.

00:06:10.055 --> 00:06:15.405
Number one, in order to win the battle
and receive God's vast strength to do

00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:16.875
that, you have to realize you're weak.

00:06:16.905 --> 00:06:18.934
You have to realize you're in need of God.

00:06:19.565 --> 00:06:20.705
You have to realize you're in need of God.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.630
of a Savior, from your sins, from the
life that you are living, from the enemy's

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.690
tactics to deceive you, you need God.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.220
If you don't recognize that, then
you won't ever receive His strength

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.079
and you won't ever win the battle.

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:37.750
Number two, you have to realize that
you can't defeat this enemy on your own.

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:42.980
Um, I speak to men on this more than
maybe women, maybe you resonate with this.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.050
Men are prideful.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.090
We don't need help.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.670
I'm broke down on the side of the
road, don't know how to fix my car,

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.300
and somebody stops by, I'm probably, I
got it, I'm on the phone with somebody.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.750
Even if this guy's a mechanic,
I'm prideful, because I

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.640
want to handle it on my own.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.020
See, we can't be prideful as believers.

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:01.180
We have to recognize we can't defeat
our enemy without God's vast strength.

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:03.269
So today, we get to talk about this.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.910
We get to talk about what
is God's vast strength.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.710
What does He give us?

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.720
What does He equip us with?

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.460
So we're gonna walk through this full
armor of God, and we're not gonna walk

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.770
through all of it, because as I got going,
I got through three of them, and I'm like,

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.320
this is enough for us to unpack today.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.470
So I'm hoping, um, that this will
be encouraging to you as we read

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.090
these verses, um, how we fight from
the place of victory in our lives

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.140
as believers, and as, if you haven't
given your life to Jesus, how you can

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.929
begin to fight from victory and give
your life to Jesus and start that.

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:33.520
So let's start, since I already
read the first several verses,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.930
let's start in verse 14 here.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.520
We're gonna finish reading these verses.

00:07:38.205 --> 00:07:40.355
Um, and I'm going to start at verse 13
because it kind of just really pulls it.

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:44.105
So, for this reason, take up the
full armor of God, so that you

00:07:44.105 --> 00:07:47.925
may be able to resist in the evil
day, and not, and having prepared

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:49.224
everything to take your stand.

00:07:49.805 --> 00:07:54.424
So he says, stand therefore with
truth like a belt around your waist,

00:07:54.904 --> 00:07:59.105
righteousness like armor on your
chest, and your feet sandaled with

00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:00.775
readiness for the gospel of peace.

00:08:01.155 --> 00:08:04.905
In every situation, take up the shield
of faith, with which you can extinguish

00:08:04.924 --> 00:08:06.955
all the flaming areas of the evil one.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.250
Take the helmet of salvation and the sword
of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.010
And I'll even read verse 18,
because we prayed over this today.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.859
So, verse 18, it says, Pray at
all times in the Spirit with

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.219
every prayer and request, and stay
alert with all perseverance and

00:08:21.219 --> 00:08:22.360
intercessions for all the saints.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.360
So, I wanted to read all of it, but
we're going to only walk through the

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.920
first couple of verses there, and the
first couple of, uh, pieces of armor.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.049
But, if we're going to fight from
the place of victory, we need to

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:35.240
take up this full armor of God.

00:08:35.995 --> 00:08:38.784
It's gonna prepare us, and he says this
in verse 13, it's gonna prepare us for

00:08:38.794 --> 00:08:40.554
all the enemy's attacks against us.

00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:42.674
So we have to take up this vast strength.

00:08:42.684 --> 00:08:45.794
So what is the armor, what is the
armor that we're supposed to take up?

00:08:45.824 --> 00:08:46.685
Let's look at this first one.

00:08:47.525 --> 00:08:48.904
It says the belt of truth.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.635
Um, question.

00:08:52.784 --> 00:08:55.604
This is, this really hit
me, um, especially since

00:08:55.604 --> 00:08:56.144
I've been dealing with it.

00:08:56.154 --> 00:08:59.434
Anybody ever had somebody that
they, was telling them something,

00:08:59.634 --> 00:09:01.594
but they struggled to believe
that they were telling the truth?

00:09:01.704 --> 00:09:02.144
Anybody?

00:09:03.964 --> 00:09:04.644
What about car salesmen?

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.770
Anybody ever go there and say, Are
you sure this is your bottom dollar?

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.550
Absolutely, sir.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.130
Are you sure?

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.010
Because I don't believe you.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.070
Okay, I'll give you another
one which I've dealt with.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.020
Furniture store.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.500
Took a year, we still didn't get our
furniture, so we finally cancelled the

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.149
order, but I still don't trust them.

00:09:19.209 --> 00:09:21.259
Like, there's something in my
mind, I'm like, I don't trust you,

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.419
but here's the struggle with car
salesman for me, now this may not

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:27.830
be you, or furniture salesman, or
anybody else that's lying to me.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:33.840
If I have no knowledge on the situation,
on really what cars values are.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.380
Or really, if furniture is
delayed a year, I have no clue

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.510
whether he's lying to me or not.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.420
I kind of have to take him at his word.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.220
So I want you to take that nugget
into whenever God tells us to win

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.250
the battles in our life, we've
got to take up this belt of truth.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:56.490
See, if we don't know what truth is,
the enemy will lie and deceive us.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.660
And if we don't know the truth, we
will be deceived, because the only

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.310
thing we have to trust is the lie.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.010
Because we're not skilled in it.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.620
So then we begin to believe the lie.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.720
And that's the only thing we have.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.790
So, that's just why we're looking at
this, is the belt, uh, for a warrior, for,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.810
um, a Roman soldier, would be important.

00:10:14.969 --> 00:10:17.370
Um, it's one that's not just worn around
the waist, like the one I'm wearing

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.949
today, but most of them, you can visualize
it, that's actually a strap over the

00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:23.380
shoulders, because it helps maintain
the weight of the rest of the armor.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.270
So truth is important in this, right?

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.829
That's why I believe Paul
brought this up, right?

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.140
This truth at the beginning.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:37.090
And so, we realized with this is
that if, if God is truth, and our

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:41.490
enemy gives us lies, how do we know
that, um, he, he's a liar as well?

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.630
I wanted to read verse, um,
John chapter 8 verse 44 says

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.170
this, um, speaking of the devil.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.130
It says, You are your father
the devil, and you want to

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.670
carry out your father's desires.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.930
He was a murderer from the beginning,
and does not stand in truth,

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.100
because there is no truth in him.

00:10:57.885 --> 00:11:01.265
When he tells a lie, he speaks from
his own nature, because he is a

00:11:01.265 --> 00:11:03.714
liar, and he is the father of lies.

00:11:04.814 --> 00:11:12.415
So, the enemy is lying to us, and he
uses, I would say this, half truths.

00:11:12.415 --> 00:11:13.434
You ever heard of half truths?

00:11:14.425 --> 00:11:17.305
It's enough truth to kind
of confuse you, right?

00:11:17.305 --> 00:11:19.535
They kind of put the truth at the
beginning, and the end, and in the middle.

00:11:19.535 --> 00:11:20.295
It's a little bit flaky.

00:11:21.185 --> 00:11:23.925
And you believe it, because you
feel like, well, this is at least

00:11:24.075 --> 00:11:25.375
part of what God says, you know.

00:11:25.505 --> 00:11:27.755
And this is part of what God
says, but in the middle, it's not.

00:11:28.435 --> 00:11:31.595
Um, and we know as, as Jesus,
whenever He was baptized and taken

00:11:31.595 --> 00:11:35.864
away for 40 days, right, fasting and
praying, that the, the devil came

00:11:35.865 --> 00:11:37.495
and began to quote scripture to Him.

00:11:37.594 --> 00:11:40.314
And Jesus began to quote it in
context, which was interesting.

00:11:40.824 --> 00:11:42.844
Um, because it was truth.

00:11:42.915 --> 00:11:46.610
And so I'm always reminded of John
17, 17, who says, His word is truth.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.850
He says, sanctify me by the truth, and
so God's word is truth, and this is why

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.170
it's important for us to know the truth.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.700
Um, but I want to ask this question.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.870
I love asking questions
and engaging you guys.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.650
Um, what lies, maybe, have you
heard from the enemy, from the

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.599
devil, from someone maybe trying
to, again, the enemy uses people.

00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:10.080
What lies have you heard, um,
that you've had to remind yourself

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.460
of God's truth to overcome?

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.540
What lies have you heard in your life?

00:12:14.325 --> 00:12:16.355
That you've had to use
God's word to overcome.

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:19.725
You're not worthy.

00:12:19.765 --> 00:12:20.375
That's a great one.

00:12:20.725 --> 00:12:22.185
What's, what, what does God say?

00:12:23.425 --> 00:12:24.355
You are worthy, right?

00:12:25.514 --> 00:12:27.484
You're, yeah, you're a
child of God, absolutely.

00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:28.205
That's good.

00:12:28.275 --> 00:12:28.835
What else?

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:36.284
You're not able to do it, yeah.

00:12:36.454 --> 00:12:38.055
You don't have the power,
you don't have the strength.

00:12:38.184 --> 00:12:39.804
You're not good enough, you're
not smart enough, right?

00:12:40.674 --> 00:12:40.874
Yeah.

00:12:41.004 --> 00:12:42.244
So what, what does God say?

00:12:46.524 --> 00:12:48.034
Because He gives us our
vast strength, right?

00:12:48.044 --> 00:12:50.084
The only way we can accomplish
things is through His vast strength.

00:12:50.084 --> 00:12:51.904
So we realize when the enemy
says you're not good enough.

00:12:52.385 --> 00:12:52.905
I'm not.

00:12:53.224 --> 00:12:53.685
He is.

00:12:54.495 --> 00:12:57.885
See, I love sometimes reminding myself
of that in the moments that I feel weak.

00:12:59.074 --> 00:13:01.554
I get to admit, yeah, you
are weak, but he isn't.

00:13:02.394 --> 00:13:03.375
Because he's stronger than me, right?

00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:05.584
He who is in you is stronger
than he who is in the world.

00:13:06.365 --> 00:13:06.854
Scripture.

00:13:07.474 --> 00:13:07.774
Truth.

00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:09.234
Somebody give me another one.

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:14.305
That you've been told that you've had to
use God's word, His truth, to overcome it.

00:13:14.305 --> 00:13:17.344
You're unlovable.

00:13:17.745 --> 00:13:18.604
What does God say?

00:13:19.755 --> 00:13:20.555
You are loved, right?

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:25.939
He says, you know, one of the greatest
pictures is that Jesus came and

00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:29.969
died for us knowing that we would
reject Him, that we had rejected Him.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.959
I've heard this statement
before, um, and this idea of

00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:37.429
when we reach people for Jesus.

00:13:38.309 --> 00:13:41.170
I remember coming to church, um,
for a year before I gave my life to

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.630
Christ, and here's what I thought.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.870
Every time I came to church, it's
like, I've gotta get better, I've

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:50.300
gotta clean myself up, and once I get
right, perfect, I'll come to the Lord.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.260
See, that's not the Lord's ways.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.100
The Lord says, Come to me,
all you who are weary, right?

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.400
And I'll give you rest.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.369
It's we come to Jesus,
and Jesus cleans us up.

00:13:59.499 --> 00:14:02.310
So this idea behind, we don't
clean a fish before we catch

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.110
it, anybody ever done that?

00:14:04.119 --> 00:14:05.180
Surprising to me, right?

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.660
But you're gonna catch it, gonna lead
people to faith in Jesus, and let the

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.420
Word of God and Jesus clean them up.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.210
And just so you know,
I'm not clean yet either.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.540
I'm still working out
some of those things.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.480
It's not okay to stay where I'm at.

00:14:18.785 --> 00:14:20.584
And I'm continually going to the
Lord and ask for forgiveness.

00:14:20.915 --> 00:14:27.194
But it's just that reminder that we
have to consistently go to the Lord and

00:14:27.435 --> 00:14:30.625
proclaim His truths rather than the lies
that say we're not even good enough.

00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:32.055
And you guys could probably
think of several more.

00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:37.304
But let's look at the first time
that the enemy deceived someone.

00:14:37.365 --> 00:14:39.834
So if any, if you guys have your
Bibles with you, go to Genesis

00:14:39.834 --> 00:14:43.275
chapter 3 uh, verses 1 through 6.

00:14:44.814 --> 00:14:47.084
If you want, you know, I don't
know about you guys, whenever I

00:14:47.084 --> 00:14:51.870
see somebody do something Wrong,
and I've done that wrong before.

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:54.860
It kind of gives me a little bit
like, Ugh, I'm not the only one.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:15:00.959
So let's look at, let's look at
two people who failed, Um, to

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.639
be deceived by, by the enemy.

00:15:03.159 --> 00:15:05.899
Um, and they, they really got
to see a half truth, right?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.750
So let's look at this, Genesis chapter 3.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:14.899
We're gonna look at verses 1 through
6, Um, and see what was said here.

00:15:18.859 --> 00:15:19.300
Alright.

00:15:20.155 --> 00:15:24.025
So it says here now, the serpent
was the most cunning of all the wild

00:15:24.025 --> 00:15:26.035
animals that the Lord God had made.

00:15:26.605 --> 00:15:31.615
He said to the woman, did God really say
you can't eat from any tree in the garden?

00:15:32.155 --> 00:15:35.455
And the woman said to the serpent, we
may eat at the fruit from the trees

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.995
and the garden, but about the fruit of
the tree in the middle of the garden.

00:15:38.995 --> 00:15:42.025
God said, you must not eat
or touch it or you will die.

00:15:42.955 --> 00:15:44.275
No, you will not die.

00:15:44.335 --> 00:15:46.645
The serpent said to the woman,
in fact, God knows what.

00:15:47.555 --> 00:15:50.645
That when you eat it, your eyes
will be opened, and you'll be

00:15:50.645 --> 00:15:52.765
like God, knowing good and evil.

00:15:53.025 --> 00:15:57.324
And so the woman saw that the
tree was good, and for food, and

00:15:57.324 --> 00:16:00.444
delightful to look at it, and that it
was desirable for obtaining wisdom.

00:16:00.555 --> 00:16:03.665
So she took some of the fruit, and
ate it, and she also gave some to her

00:16:03.665 --> 00:16:06.115
husband, who was with her, and he ate it.

00:16:06.235 --> 00:16:09.725
And both of their eyes were opened,
and they knew that they were naked,

00:16:09.725 --> 00:16:12.665
so they sewed fig leaves together
and made coverings for themselves.

00:16:14.115 --> 00:16:16.334
First time we see the
enemy deceive someone.

00:16:17.405 --> 00:16:18.885
It was Adam and Eve in the beginning.

00:16:18.975 --> 00:16:20.185
And this is how it all started, right?

00:16:20.324 --> 00:16:20.814
The fall.

00:16:22.824 --> 00:16:24.865
And the enemy, it was interesting.

00:16:25.044 --> 00:16:27.975
The Eve even responded with truth.

00:16:29.425 --> 00:16:34.265
But when the enemy came back with,
But no, this is really what God meant.

00:16:34.564 --> 00:16:36.115
She quickly said, Oh, it does look good.

00:16:36.305 --> 00:16:37.355
And she moved on, right?

00:16:38.834 --> 00:16:41.885
Faulting her, even though I do say
it was Eve that took the bite first.

00:16:41.895 --> 00:16:43.655
So men, I think we're off the hook here.

00:16:44.214 --> 00:16:45.095
Um, no, that's not true.

00:16:45.524 --> 00:16:49.244
But what I would say is, is if Adam and
Eve can be deceived, we can be deceived.

00:16:50.144 --> 00:16:53.324
You know, I've, I've heard
this statement before.

00:16:53.944 --> 00:16:55.164
I'm a Christian, I wouldn't do that.

00:16:55.574 --> 00:16:57.154
I'm strong in my faith,
I wouldn't do that.

00:16:57.314 --> 00:16:58.604
No, no, no, no, no.

00:16:58.604 --> 00:17:00.714
That is exactly what the
enemy wants you to think.

00:17:00.724 --> 00:17:01.544
He wants to deceive you.

00:17:01.544 --> 00:17:05.565
So it's interesting, when we look at this
text, that the enemy wants to either get

00:17:05.565 --> 00:17:10.925
you to doubt God, as we see in Genesis 3,
to doubt what God said, or he wants you

00:17:10.925 --> 00:17:13.554
to neglect the Word of God completely.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.619
Because if you neglect it, and a lie
comes, you don't even know the truth

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.440
to even begin to push back on that.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.339
I believe, and the reason why I believe
this is because it's something even

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:28.270
I've struggled with, right, is we don't
spend time in the Word with the truth.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.230
And when we don't spend time in
the Word with the truth, people

00:17:31.389 --> 00:17:33.870
are ignorantly, and that word is
just meaning you just didn't know.

00:17:33.899 --> 00:17:36.710
You're ignorantly
following the enemy's ways.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.299
But God has given us a clear way to
know His truth, to overcome the enemy.

00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:44.639
So, um, so in order to fight
against the enemy, we have to

00:17:44.639 --> 00:17:45.840
put on this belt of truth, right?

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.470
We talked about how the belt
is so important for a warrior,

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.829
it's so important for us, right?

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.110
It holds up the rest of the
armor we're gonna talk about.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.629
So we need to start putting on
the belt of truth each morning.

00:17:55.629 --> 00:17:57.919
And this is just a reminder for me,
since I've been walking through this

00:17:57.919 --> 00:18:01.750
text, every day we should wake up and
put the belt of truth, which means

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:05.520
we should be spending time in God's
Word, into our lives, to be ready for

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.000
our day, to go into battle, right?

00:18:07.945 --> 00:18:09.804
Anybody ever heard, and this
is just kind of affirming this,

00:18:09.804 --> 00:18:11.574
anybody ever heard how the U.

00:18:11.574 --> 00:18:11.675
S.

00:18:11.705 --> 00:18:16.104
government deals with, um, the fake money?

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:17.554
How they prepare for it?

00:18:17.574 --> 00:18:17.955
Anybody?

00:18:18.274 --> 00:18:19.034
How do they prepare for it?

00:18:21.154 --> 00:18:22.434
They study the real kind, right?

00:18:23.034 --> 00:18:26.694
So for you, it's not about, hey, let's
figure out all the 97, 000 ways that

00:18:26.695 --> 00:18:27.915
the enemy's gonna try to deceive me.

00:18:28.264 --> 00:18:31.675
No, spend the majority of
your time on the real truth.

00:18:32.115 --> 00:18:33.995
Then when the enemy comes,
you'll know when it's a lie.

00:18:34.235 --> 00:18:35.375
It's the same way, okay?

00:18:35.785 --> 00:18:37.395
So let's look at the next, right?

00:18:37.465 --> 00:18:39.795
The next set of armor.

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:43.615
So we have the belt of truth, but then
he says, um, and I'll just read this

00:18:43.615 --> 00:18:47.485
out of here, um, and righteousness
like the armor on your chest.

00:18:47.485 --> 00:18:49.464
And so many of you would probably
have a version that says the

00:18:49.465 --> 00:18:50.985
breastplate of righteousness.

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.074
Here's what I think about.

00:18:53.554 --> 00:18:55.975
There's many times I wish I would have
had the breastplate of righteousness

00:18:55.975 --> 00:18:57.065
when I got the wind knocked out of me.

00:18:57.065 --> 00:18:59.925
Anybody ever had somebody just
like kick you in the stomach or you

00:18:59.935 --> 00:19:02.295
went over the top of your bike and
you landed right in your stomach

00:19:02.295 --> 00:19:03.475
and you lost all your wind, right?

00:19:04.245 --> 00:19:06.345
Um, and then those moments that
I'm like, man, I wish I would

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:09.535
have had that breastplate of
righteousness or a real armor, right?

00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:13.145
Um, but this is one of the many
reasons why those soldiers wore this.

00:19:13.835 --> 00:19:18.945
The most important vitals in your body
are what's behind that plate, that

00:19:18.955 --> 00:19:22.475
metal plate, or some would have chains,
right, this armor, uh, to protect

00:19:22.475 --> 00:19:25.175
their most vital organs that could kill
them, right, other than their head.

00:19:25.695 --> 00:19:28.375
Um, and so it was an
important aspect, right?

00:19:28.865 --> 00:19:33.080
Um, so when we look at what righteousness
is, It's the condition of being in

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.470
a right relationship with the Lord.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.540
Um, and so this can only happen through
our total dependence and faith in God.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.690
And when we think about this,
this is part of our defense

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.660
against the attacks of the enemy.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.340
Right living.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.699
Um, and so it's not just knowing
the truth, so the belt of truth, but

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.340
it's applying the truth in our lives.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.590
So they go together.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.760
Not just knowing the truth,
but applying the truth.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.950
So here's a challenge to
begin thinking through.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:59.049
I'm gonna give you some
time to think through this.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.820
Whenever I think about my life,
right, if I'm thinking about armor,

00:20:05.639 --> 00:20:08.930
I don't want there to be any holes
in my, my, my, at least my, we're

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:09.889
talking about vital organs here.

00:20:09.889 --> 00:20:11.740
I don't want any holes, any places.

00:20:12.389 --> 00:20:16.189
But any area of our life that we have
not surrendered to the Lord, to the truth

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:22.129
that God has in His Word, are open areas
where the enemy wants to come in, right?

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.680
The enemy's looking for, in
a battle, they're looking for

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.040
the weakest part of your armor.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:27.930
And they're looking...

00:20:29.175 --> 00:20:30.085
To attack you, right?

00:20:30.085 --> 00:20:30.815
And to win in that.

00:20:31.765 --> 00:20:34.105
And, uh, I was, I was talking
with my kids yesterday.

00:20:35.055 --> 00:20:40.345
And, uh, I don't know if any of
you have ever, um, played Ninja.

00:20:40.395 --> 00:20:41.934
Anybody, anybody ever played Ninja before?

00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:43.315
Seen kids play Ninja?

00:20:43.315 --> 00:20:44.025
Ah, there we go.

00:20:44.045 --> 00:20:44.825
You understand Ninja.

00:20:45.205 --> 00:20:46.844
It's this whole thing, like,
one, two, three, Ninja, and you

00:20:46.855 --> 00:20:47.825
get in your Ninja pose, right?

00:20:47.825 --> 00:20:49.885
And your whole thing is, and
it depends on your rules.

00:20:50.705 --> 00:20:53.745
You're either gonna play, the only thing
you can hit, you know, you can chop their

00:20:53.745 --> 00:20:55.175
wrist, or you can chop up to their arm.

00:20:56.044 --> 00:20:59.084
But, if you go to swipe at it, you're
gonna swipe at the most vulnerable

00:20:59.245 --> 00:21:04.074
arm, but the person on the other
side gets the chance to move, and if

00:21:04.074 --> 00:21:05.334
they move, that's their move, right?

00:21:05.885 --> 00:21:08.435
But they're looking for
the most vulnerable spot.

00:21:09.594 --> 00:21:11.264
I started thinking, I've
watched my kids play Ninja all

00:21:11.264 --> 00:21:12.354
the time, this is the enemy.

00:21:13.074 --> 00:21:16.844
The enemy is looking, and they're
saying, hey, you know, most of, of

00:21:16.844 --> 00:21:21.385
your breastplate is, is covered,
except for this one area, you know,

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:22.615
and that's where I'm gonna go.

00:21:23.854 --> 00:21:24.145
So.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.160
So, think about this.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.130
Where is your weakest spot?

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.470
Where is your weakest spot?

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.829
So I want us to take time, and I want to
do this in the middle of our service here.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:36.980
I want you to close your eyes.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.849
I'm going to walk through
a couple of questions.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.600
And I really want you to identify
maybe where your weakness is.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.120
And then, when you find it, I want
you to give it over to the Lord.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.790
So, what is the weakest area, maybe
where you've let down your guard?

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.649
And I've left it wide open to the enemy.

00:21:52.649 --> 00:21:53.879
And I'm just gonna talk about this, right?

00:21:53.879 --> 00:21:55.280
Maybe it's your daily time with God.

00:21:55.879 --> 00:21:57.780
Maybe you have not put
on that belt of truth.

00:21:58.869 --> 00:21:59.710
Have you covered it?

00:22:00.919 --> 00:22:01.850
Or is it wide open?

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.600
Maybe it's your purity.

00:22:04.629 --> 00:22:06.049
You say, hey, I'm a strong Christian.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.659
I don't need anything to
protect myself against lust.

00:22:08.669 --> 00:22:10.850
But, man, maybe that's
an area you just let go.

00:22:12.399 --> 00:22:13.409
Maybe it's your time, right?

00:22:13.409 --> 00:22:15.310
You're too busy to spend time with God.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.750
You're too busy to do God's work.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:17.980
You're too busy to go to church.

00:22:18.989 --> 00:22:19.919
You left that wide open.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.310
And the enemy's gonna use it.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.860
Maybe it's greed.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.890
Maybe you're unwilling to be
generous because you don't trust

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.010
God to provide for you if you give.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:30.780
Here's one.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.659
Maybe it's self doubt.

00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:34.219
Maybe that you're not good enough.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.970
Maybe you're not secure in
your relationship with Jesus.

00:22:38.819 --> 00:22:40.150
Maybe it's something I didn't mention.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.910
But I want you to think through
maybe where you're weak.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.070
I want you to take a couple of minutes.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.720
And maybe it's everything I mentioned,
and maybe it's something I didn't mention.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:56.030
But this is a great time to say, Lord,
let me cover those areas with that

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:57.779
breastplate of righteousness now.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.610
So let's take some time to pray over that.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.419
So as we continue on,
I want to mention this.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.970
This is another thing when we think
about the breastplate of righteousness.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.490
Righteousness is right living.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.500
See, sometimes the enemy, when we
talk about deceiving, the enemy wants

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.980
to come in, He wants to question,
again, your relationship with

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.840
Jesus, your rightness with Jesus.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:09.730
And this is the part I want to be
as clear as possible is, um, We're

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:10.920
not perfect this side of heaven.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.740
So we're going to make mistakes, and so
when anyone wants to come in and say,

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.699
Hey, during your time of prayer just a
couple of minutes ago, the enemy's sitting

00:24:17.749 --> 00:24:21.759
there saying, Hey, I can't believe you
as a believer would leave these three

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:25.770
spots open to your life to be, Oh, you're
horrible, you're not good enough, right?

00:24:26.105 --> 00:24:26.905
That's all the enemy.

00:24:26.905 --> 00:24:31.435
So, so when you hear this, this is
God saying this, those open areas

00:24:31.625 --> 00:24:34.785
on your armor are not good for you.

00:24:35.355 --> 00:24:36.874
They are a weakness for you.

00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:41.495
And my vast strength can
cover them and protect you.

00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:43.025
If you'll just receive them.

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:44.835
See, that's the thing I love about God.

00:24:44.995 --> 00:24:49.225
He's not sitting there poking fun,
and trying to make you feel bad, and

00:24:49.225 --> 00:24:50.625
like, Oh gosh, you're such a loser.

00:24:50.625 --> 00:24:51.555
No, that's the enemy.

00:24:51.575 --> 00:24:54.945
God's saying, I've redeemed you, I've
saved you, I've given you hope, I've given

00:24:54.945 --> 00:24:56.575
you the ability to overcome these things.

00:24:56.665 --> 00:24:59.705
Praise God we have a Savior
that is that type of a God,

00:24:59.705 --> 00:25:00.945
rather than just an accuser.

00:25:01.615 --> 00:25:02.405
See, that's our enemy.

00:25:02.405 --> 00:25:05.335
So that's the ability, when you
know God's word, you know how to

00:25:05.335 --> 00:25:07.565
reject those lies and claim truth.

00:25:07.895 --> 00:25:08.115
Right?

00:25:08.115 --> 00:25:11.655
He's forgiven you for maybe those areas
you've left open, and He's saying, Now.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.190
Forgive and move on and cover them.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.030
Don't just leave them
open, but cover them.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.540
So let's look at the last one
we're going to cover today.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.510
The shoes of the gospel.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:21.700
Right, the shoes of the gospel.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.910
Let me read, uh, verse 15.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:27.160
It says, And your feet sandaled with
the readiness for the gospel of peace.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:32.529
Anybody ever seen, um, a basketball
player or a football player

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:33.560
ever change shoes mid game?

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:35.460
There's something wrong
with the shoes, right?

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.210
They're slipping.

00:25:36.795 --> 00:25:38.645
Or they've got some kind
of jinx, they think, right?

00:25:38.655 --> 00:25:39.375
So they switch shoes.

00:25:39.385 --> 00:25:41.215
So shoes are important in sports.

00:25:41.545 --> 00:25:42.735
That relates with me, right?

00:25:43.075 --> 00:25:44.275
That's trying to win a battle.

00:25:44.694 --> 00:25:45.155
Win a game.

00:25:45.855 --> 00:25:50.295
See, shoes were important for the
warriors, the people who were going

00:25:50.295 --> 00:25:51.484
into battle, the Roman soldiers.

00:25:51.484 --> 00:25:52.135
They were important.

00:25:52.765 --> 00:25:55.065
Um, and if you look at them, they
have something called hobnails, which

00:25:55.065 --> 00:25:56.545
I had to look up what a hobnail was.

00:25:56.745 --> 00:25:57.315
Go look it up.

00:25:57.315 --> 00:25:58.235
It looks interesting.

00:25:58.235 --> 00:26:01.015
But it's basically metal cleats on
the bottom of their shoes so that

00:26:01.015 --> 00:26:02.175
they wouldn't slip or fall in battle.

00:26:02.185 --> 00:26:03.765
They wanted to make sure they could stand.

00:26:04.255 --> 00:26:05.745
Strong in the midst of battle.

00:26:05.825 --> 00:26:06.345
Does that make sense?

00:26:06.345 --> 00:26:08.855
When we think about a believer,
putting on armor, we want to

00:26:08.865 --> 00:26:10.315
stand strong against our enemy.

00:26:10.315 --> 00:26:11.395
We don't want to slip.

00:26:11.775 --> 00:26:12.524
We want to stand strong.

00:26:13.375 --> 00:26:19.104
So when we look at this, um, he's talking
about shoes of the gospel of peace.

00:26:19.864 --> 00:26:24.355
And I think about our feet not only allows
us to stand against our enemy and hold

00:26:24.355 --> 00:26:27.365
strong, but our feet takes us into battle.

00:26:27.655 --> 00:26:27.835
Right?

00:26:27.865 --> 00:26:29.135
Our feet takes us into battle.

00:26:29.335 --> 00:26:30.054
And I think about this.

00:26:31.005 --> 00:26:34.465
Is when we say we're fighting
against our enemy, it's not just

00:26:34.465 --> 00:26:37.795
saying no to sin and no to Satan.

00:26:37.915 --> 00:26:39.245
It's saying yes to Jesus.

00:26:39.665 --> 00:26:41.495
See, there's an offensive side to this.

00:26:41.705 --> 00:26:45.035
It's not just about putting up our
armor and taking all the beatings

00:26:45.035 --> 00:26:46.935
until we come to see Jesus one day.

00:26:47.265 --> 00:26:53.675
But it's actually fighting against and
moving hobnobs on the bottom, right?

00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:54.995
And push against the enemy.

00:26:55.325 --> 00:26:56.815
with the gospel of peace.

00:26:56.855 --> 00:27:00.375
Proclaiming peace over your life, peace
over other people's lives, right, and

00:27:00.375 --> 00:27:01.885
sharing that gospel hope with them.

00:27:02.295 --> 00:27:04.855
And that's just a challenge to me,
that first, you know, when we take,

00:27:04.855 --> 00:27:08.215
think about this piece, right,
first, the gospel piece, in order

00:27:08.215 --> 00:27:11.625
to bring it with us into battle,
we have to experience it ourselves.

00:27:11.625 --> 00:27:13.045
We have to experience it ourselves.

00:27:13.785 --> 00:27:15.435
Um, I, I know this.

00:27:15.435 --> 00:27:17.455
I've seen a lot of people sell products.

00:27:17.895 --> 00:27:18.975
You know what I'm talking about.

00:27:19.515 --> 00:27:22.375
Uh, Avon, or whatever it's called,
and all those different things.

00:27:22.715 --> 00:27:23.825
I've seen them sell it.

00:27:23.985 --> 00:27:26.125
The only way that they'll be
good at selling it is if they

00:27:26.125 --> 00:27:28.515
believe it themselves, if they
believe it works themselves.

00:27:28.575 --> 00:27:30.435
And when they do, they're good salesmen.

00:27:32.075 --> 00:27:34.995
So the thing is, is have you
received the gospel of peace?

00:27:35.455 --> 00:27:38.375
Have you truly received
what God has given us?

00:27:38.375 --> 00:27:41.905
And so Romans 5 once says this, Therefore
we have been justified by faith.

00:27:42.175 --> 00:27:44.735
We have peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:27:44.925 --> 00:27:46.475
So we now have full access to God.

00:27:46.475 --> 00:27:49.895
Thank God that we have peace with God.

00:27:50.665 --> 00:27:51.604
We have His vast strength.

00:27:51.905 --> 00:27:53.465
We have to proclaim that first.

00:27:54.115 --> 00:27:54.405
Okay?

00:27:54.865 --> 00:27:55.635
It's so important.

00:27:56.455 --> 00:28:00.385
Second, that peace from God should
lead us to have peace with man.

00:28:00.385 --> 00:28:02.975
So, this goes back to, and I don't
want us to miss this, and I love this

00:28:02.975 --> 00:28:07.575
thought of this, he says this back
here in verse 12, that our struggle

00:28:07.575 --> 00:28:09.014
is not against flesh and blood.

00:28:09.875 --> 00:28:13.575
So, our enemy is not our brothers
and sisters in Christ, and I'll even

00:28:13.575 --> 00:28:16.275
say this, our enemies are not those
who are outside the faith of Christ.

00:28:16.725 --> 00:28:20.585
They may be the ones that are
spewing hate, or rejecting Christ.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.340
But they're not our enemy.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.560
So we need to have peace with them,
meaning we don't have to agree with them.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.580
But it means that we are
not there to degrade them.

00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:32.590
We're not there to, uh,
basically, I guess, make a fool

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:33.639
of yourself as a Christ follower.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:37.409
We're there to love them, share
the hope, and the gospel peace.

00:28:37.939 --> 00:28:39.560
But it's not up to us
to get them to respond.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.210
It's not up to us to make sure that
they're right on every political point, or

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:48.410
every COVID point, or whatever it is ours,
is to share the hope and the gospel peace.

00:28:49.105 --> 00:28:50.575
And let God do the work in their hearts.

00:28:50.575 --> 00:28:52.855
So our enemy is not them.

00:28:53.095 --> 00:28:54.505
It's not each other.

00:28:54.505 --> 00:28:55.975
'cause here's the thing, I
see it in the church too.

00:28:56.005 --> 00:28:56.785
You guys know, you do.

00:28:57.175 --> 00:28:58.105
You see the battles in the church.

00:28:58.105 --> 00:28:59.065
It's not each other.

00:28:59.575 --> 00:29:02.965
So we have to have not only peace with
God ourselves, but peace with each other.

00:29:03.265 --> 00:29:05.665
Because if not, we're
distracted from the real enemy.

00:29:05.885 --> 00:29:11.455
See, when we have peace with God, which
means we don't have this struggling

00:29:11.455 --> 00:29:14.005
relationship, we don't have a broken
relationship with God and we don't have

00:29:14.005 --> 00:29:17.875
a broken relationship with each other,
we now link arms and we put on the.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.870
The belt of truth, and the
breastplate of righteousness,

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.430
and the shoes of the gospel.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.240
And we go into battle together
to defeat the one enemy that

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.039
we know is behind all of this.

00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:30.790
Is behind all of this.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.189
And this is the lastly, right?

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.360
We must prepare each day to
share the gospel of peace with

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.729
those who haven't experienced it.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:42.790
See, we know that every person
that doesn't know Jesus before they

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.319
leave this world will go to hell.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.019
And that's not me sitting here
saying, Oh gosh, I want to...

00:29:47.345 --> 00:29:49.115
Man, pressure you into
giving your life to Jesus?

00:29:49.115 --> 00:29:49.335
No.

00:29:49.335 --> 00:29:51.955
Or pressure you into going to,
man, you need to go share, share

00:29:51.955 --> 00:29:53.285
Jesus just because you're afraid?

00:29:53.285 --> 00:29:59.215
No, no, no, like, Yes, there is an eternal
hell, but it's really this idea of God

00:29:59.225 --> 00:30:02.265
has given you the gospel of peace to
be offensive with it, which means not

00:30:02.295 --> 00:30:05.455
offensive, but offensive to go with it.

00:30:05.725 --> 00:30:08.645
We're ready with the gospel of peace
to share it with those who need it.

00:30:09.065 --> 00:30:12.635
See, I think of Martin Luther who said
this, he says, it wouldn't matter if Jesus

00:30:12.635 --> 00:30:14.285
died a thousand times if no one heard it.

00:30:15.385 --> 00:30:16.215
If no one heard it.

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:19.315
So here's the cool part, this mission
team that's here this week with us,

00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:23.555
they're going with the gospel of
peace, and they're gonna walk to a lot

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:25.254
of homes and share Jesus with them.

00:30:25.795 --> 00:30:28.725
And we're all, hopefully, going to be
at this event at the park on Wednesday.

00:30:28.805 --> 00:30:32.515
And we're going to be there, with the
Gospel of Peace, to love people where

00:30:32.515 --> 00:30:34.515
they're at, to share the truth with them.

00:30:34.525 --> 00:30:37.525
We're not changing the truth to make
sure that we welcome everybody, but

00:30:37.525 --> 00:30:40.295
we are clearly giving the truth, and
we're allowing God to work through

00:30:40.295 --> 00:30:41.975
that, to lead people to faith in Jesus.

00:30:42.865 --> 00:30:45.345
So this idea, again, fighting from
the place of victory, means we

00:30:45.345 --> 00:30:48.515
know what it takes to defeat the
enemy, and we know what it takes for

00:30:48.515 --> 00:30:49.595
someone else to defeat the enemy.

00:30:50.495 --> 00:30:53.635
If you know, this has always been
the thing for me to motivate me.

00:30:54.525 --> 00:30:55.425
Cancer's prevalent.

00:30:55.465 --> 00:30:56.615
It's even within our team.

00:30:57.165 --> 00:30:59.955
Uh, we have a young lady who's 30
who's dealing with breast cancer.

00:31:00.475 --> 00:31:03.685
And, uh, seeing her go through that battle
has been difficult, but seeing her use

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.195
God's vast strength has been amazing.

00:31:06.305 --> 00:31:07.355
But here, here's what I know.

00:31:07.895 --> 00:31:12.095
If any of us in this room said, Hey,
someone's given me the cure to cancer,

00:31:12.765 --> 00:31:16.115
I don't think there'd be a person that
would run out of this facility and go tell

00:31:16.155 --> 00:31:19.855
everyone they can, because they want, and
everybody in here's probably experienced

00:31:19.865 --> 00:31:20.845
somebody who's walked through cancer.

00:31:20.855 --> 00:31:22.355
They want somebody to
be cured from cancer.

00:31:22.525 --> 00:31:23.405
That is a heart strain.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.370
For most of us, we want
them to win that battle.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.140
Here's what God's given you, something
greater than the cure to cancer.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:34.140
It's a cure to an eternity
separated from God forever.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.400
Why aren't we running with the belt
of truth, with the breastplate of

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.260
righteousness, with the shoes of
the gospel of peace, and telling

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:50.560
every single person how they can
experience Jesus and salvation, right?

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.230
That's the motivation we should have.

00:31:53.595 --> 00:31:56.475
So, so you know, I struggle with that too.

00:31:56.675 --> 00:31:58.635
And here's what happens,
the enemy distracts me.

00:31:59.345 --> 00:32:00.295
The enemy deceives me.

00:32:00.885 --> 00:32:04.185
So those things, when I begin to ask you
to think through maybe where the enemy

00:32:04.275 --> 00:32:08.705
is using, you know, the weak part of your
lives, that's exactly what he's doing.

00:32:09.235 --> 00:32:10.745
So why do we put on this armor?

00:32:10.765 --> 00:32:15.925
Because we want to be used by God for
His glory, for our good, so that others

00:32:15.925 --> 00:32:17.675
can experience the hope of the gospel.

00:32:19.755 --> 00:32:23.575
So Isaiah 52, uh, 7 says this, How
beautiful on the mountains are the

00:32:23.575 --> 00:32:28.325
feet of the herald, who proclaims
peace, who brings news of good

00:32:28.525 --> 00:32:32.435
things, and proclaims salvation,
who says to Zion, Your God reigns.

00:32:32.885 --> 00:32:36.545
So we started off today asking
this question, How do we fight

00:32:36.545 --> 00:32:37.485
from the place of victory?

00:32:38.715 --> 00:32:43.235
Paul has simply explained it by taking
up the full armor of God so that we can

00:32:43.235 --> 00:32:45.235
prepare for the enemy's attacks, right?

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.120
Taking up his vast strength.

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.170
So we're gonna take up these three
things, and next week you have

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.080
to come back for the other three.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.010
Go read ahead, put those on too.

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:54.820
I'm not telling you not to put those on,
because he says put on the full armor.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.820
But today I want to just take
time to deal with these three.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.060
So the belt of truth, the
breastplate of righteousness,

00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.980
and the shoes of the gospel.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:04.100
These are very important
in our lives as believers.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.490
So if you want to, and this is kind of my
last statement to everybody, if you want

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:13.160
to fight for victory, you want to win
the battles in your life, then it takes.

00:33:14.505 --> 00:33:15.895
Accepting God's vast strength.

00:33:16.245 --> 00:33:20.295
Accepting, really, the payment
that He made on the cross by

00:33:20.305 --> 00:33:21.825
His Son, Jesus, for your sins.

00:33:22.085 --> 00:33:22.955
For your weakness.

00:33:23.465 --> 00:33:25.745
So you have to recognize you're
weak and in need of a Savior.

00:33:26.675 --> 00:33:30.725
And know that you will never win the
battles in your life apart from Jesus.

00:33:31.665 --> 00:33:36.495
So as we take time, uh, as Brock, um,
leads us through our time of invitation,

00:33:36.935 --> 00:33:37.905
I want to be as clear as I can.

00:33:37.905 --> 00:33:40.545
So many times the invitation
is just a process in the game.

00:33:40.545 --> 00:33:41.885
We're going to stand up
and we're going to sing.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.460
And service is almost over, yay.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:47.960
But I really want you to sink into this
time, because invitation says this.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.260
God is inviting every
one of you in this room.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.260
I don't care if you've been a
believer your whole life, or

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.590
you aren't a believer right now.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.030
God is inviting every one
of you into a next step.

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:00.850
Invitation, that's what it means.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:02.960
Into a next step of what?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.110
Maybe it's putting on the full armor
of God because you didn't do it.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:06.900
You haven't been doing it.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:08.870
Maybe it's...

00:34:09.685 --> 00:34:14.105
Actually even recognizing God as your
Lord and Savior, the one that you need.

00:34:14.435 --> 00:34:19.315
Maybe you need to give your life to Jesus
today And this is the greatest day to do

00:34:19.315 --> 00:34:23.055
that because you're not promised tomorrow
So God says today is the day of salvation

00:34:23.575 --> 00:34:27.165
So if you want to talk about what that
means to follow Jesus I'm going to be in

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:28.825
the back during this time of invitation.

00:34:28.835 --> 00:34:32.305
I want to talk with you if maybe
you're questioning you're struggling

00:34:32.305 --> 00:34:36.085
with your faith and you Don't know how
you're going to overcome the amount

00:34:36.085 --> 00:34:39.955
of armor that you haven't been putting
on and you need help Come talk to me.

00:34:40.345 --> 00:34:41.105
That's what I'm here for.

00:34:41.915 --> 00:34:43.245
I want to walk with you through this.

00:34:43.245 --> 00:34:46.175
That's what God's called me and a lot
of people in this room to do, is to

00:34:46.175 --> 00:34:50.565
walk with you to discover your purpose
through a relationship with Jesus,

00:34:51.385 --> 00:34:53.965
to be fully armored for God's glory.

00:34:54.405 --> 00:34:57.215
So I'm going to pray for us, and
after I pray, we'll all stand,

00:34:57.605 --> 00:34:59.985
worship, and spend some time giving
those things over to the Lord.

00:35:00.115 --> 00:35:01.545
Please come talk to me
if you have questions.

00:35:02.745 --> 00:35:04.195
I would love to talk with you.

00:35:04.195 --> 00:35:04.615
So let's pray.

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:07.665
Lord Jesus, you are God, and we are not.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.980
And in this moment, and in this
time walking through this text,

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.020
we recognized our weakness.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:21.480
Um, Lord, even as a pastor sitting up
here, um, I had to remind myself of

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.720
some of the weak areas of my armor.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.500
God, may you help each one of us consider
what those areas are and begin to

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.600
put on that armor and not neglect it.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.730
Lord, I know this, I
want to win the battle.

00:35:36.075 --> 00:35:37.855
I know you've already
won, so I want to win.

00:35:38.155 --> 00:35:41.205
And I want to win in such a way that
brings you glory and helps others

00:35:41.215 --> 00:35:43.045
experience your hope and your peace.

00:35:44.015 --> 00:35:47.925
Um, and so first, Lord, I want
us all to receive that peace.

00:35:47.955 --> 00:35:51.425
And so if there's a person in this room,
Lord, that doesn't know you, doesn't,

00:35:51.445 --> 00:35:55.575
isn't sure if they know you, Lord, don't
let them leave today without talking about

00:35:55.575 --> 00:35:57.315
that with me to consider what that is.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.650
Lord, I pray for every person in this
room, Lord, that they don't leave change,

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:04.230
Lord, that, that they, that they don't
walk out of here the same way they walked

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:08.880
in, but they leave completely change from
your word because they applied it to their

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.300
lives and they begin to put on that armor.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:11.810
God, you're good.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.000
We're thankful for this
time to meet together.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.630
We're thankful that
your presence was here.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:18.950
And Lord, may you send
us out with it as well.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.580
And we pray this in your heavenly name.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.754
Amen.
