00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.610
All right, well welcome
everybody back to Inspiring Hope.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.910
Last week was so unique
in not having service.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.450
Um, it's always those moments
where it's like, is it legal

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.920
in church not to have church?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.510
Is it legal?

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:20.685
It is.

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:22.905
Um, I hope you guys
enjoyed your, your weekend.

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:24.015
Um, I know I did.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:27.585
Our family got to get away for about
a week and we traveled back on Sunday

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:31.605
and so, um, it's always those moments
where when I get back I am super

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.375
pumped to be back and usually the first
opportunity they get, get to, to see

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:38.235
what I call my family, my church family.

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:39.105
I love it.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.525
I just been smiling a lot today just
seeing you guys, so you may be surprised,

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:44.655
but I actually like y'all a little bit.

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:45.705
Okay.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:49.515
Um, and so, you know, it's really,
really good to see ya and glad

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:53.235
that we get the opportunity to, to
come back and continue our series.

00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:55.485
So we've been talking
about Shalom, Shalom.

00:00:55.485 --> 00:01:00.015
So finding God's perfect peace in
the midst of our mental struggles.

00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:03.735
Um, and it's been a, an interesting
series as we've walked through this.

00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:07.275
Um, I, I think many people probably
have struggled with different things.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.950
I'm hoping that if you have, if you
don't struggle with these things,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.880
that maybe you're learning something.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.460
So if one day you do or you
have friends that do that you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.860
can point them to, to Jesus.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.280
You can point them to how we continue to
heal and how we continue to recover and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.510
how we continue to, to overcome some of
these things and live with these things.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.520
And so, um, we've got two weeks left.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.180
We've got today and then next week.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.610
Um, and so today we get to
talk about how God heals.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.700
Our trauma.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.760
Um, and I would say this, that
as we begin to think about our

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.530
lives, many of us have went through
some form of a traumatic event.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.890
Um, and, and I kind of think about
this as actually interesting,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.910
actually all of us did.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.790
If you think about Covid, all
of us have went through some

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:49.320
sort of trauma in our lives.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.100
Um, and whenever I think about that,
it, it, it's a difficult subject.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.490
And the reason why is
everybody's trauma is different.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.435
Um, yet, Every one of us has experienced
it in different forms, and some of

00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:04.945
us experience it more often at times.

00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:09.265
We really can't relate with
a person because we're not

00:02:09.265 --> 00:02:10.495
going through that with them.

00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:11.845
We go through something differently.

00:02:11.845 --> 00:02:16.105
And so as we talk about this today,
I wanna be very sensitive, uh, as

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.075
we continue to talk about how we
heal from trauma, that it's not.

00:02:20.055 --> 00:02:21.735
I, I, uh, basically quick fix.

00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:24.945
It's not a one time decision
to continue to work through

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:29.085
processing, healing and overcoming
the trauma that we've been through.

00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:32.955
Um, and so don't, don't hear what I
say today as, man, he just says, we

00:02:32.955 --> 00:02:36.435
need to get over it and just give it
to Jesus and it's all gonna be fine.

00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:40.185
What I want you to hear is it's
a process, and one things you're

00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:43.305
gonna continue to hear over and
over again is that it is a process

00:02:43.305 --> 00:02:45.135
that needs to be done in community.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.760
In order to heal from our trauma,
we need to do this in community,

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.739
and it takes time to do that.

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.559
And so we'll be talking more
and more about that today.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.799
Um, and so my hope is, is through being
able to share a little bit about what I've

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.019
went through in my life, along with, um,
what Paul and the Bible has went through,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.100
and how he processed some of the trauma
that he went through and how he was able

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.589
to find healing that maybe just maybe.

00:03:10.234 --> 00:03:14.554
We will leave outta here on the journey
to begin to overcome our, our trauma and

00:03:14.554 --> 00:03:15.695
the things that we have went through.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.704
And so again, I wanna speak to
those who may be like, oh, I

00:03:17.704 --> 00:03:18.875
haven't had any trauma in my life.

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:19.714
Well, praise God.

00:03:20.255 --> 00:03:23.464
Um, there's people all around you
that have that maybe you can help.

00:03:23.795 --> 00:03:27.904
Uh, and there may be one day that you go
through this and you need this as well.

00:03:27.904 --> 00:03:30.635
And so the question
then is, what is trauma?

00:03:31.084 --> 00:03:34.625
Uh, so many people think about
trauma, uh, as basically the

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:36.665
event injury or abuse, but.

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:40.065
Actually trauma is the response to that.

00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:46.155
And so just a, a basic, um, definition
of it is trauma is a response to a deeply

00:03:46.155 --> 00:03:51.135
disturbing and distressing event, a
deeply disturbing and distressing event.

00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:53.865
And so it's the response to
it, it's not necessarily the

00:03:53.865 --> 00:03:56.685
action, but how we respond to it.

00:03:56.685 --> 00:04:01.305
And this is why I say this is
something small may trigger you

00:04:01.305 --> 00:04:03.315
to have something traumatic.

00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:06.645
And your response that somebody
else may not go through.

00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:10.335
And this is why I say trauma is
so different amongst all of us.

00:04:10.365 --> 00:04:13.635
And again, many of us think of it as just
physical, but sometimes it's emotional,

00:04:13.635 --> 00:04:16.214
it's mental, it's spiritual as well.

00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:18.975
And so this is why we need to
remember these things is that

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.625
are the wounds that we can't see.

00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:25.365
They're below the surface, sometimes
hurt just as much or more than the

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:29.925
ones we can see, but many of us in the
trauma that we're dealing with or that

00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:32.145
we have dealt with, we don't ever.

00:04:32.865 --> 00:04:33.495
Heal from it.

00:04:33.495 --> 00:04:37.034
We don't ever really
recognize it and name it.

00:04:37.515 --> 00:04:39.825
Um, and many of you have probably
heard this first before it should be

00:04:39.825 --> 00:04:43.755
up on the screen and on your papers,
is that Romans A 28 says this.

00:04:44.115 --> 00:04:47.445
It says, we know that all things
work together for the good of

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.984
those who love God and who are
called according to his purpose.

00:04:51.974 --> 00:04:55.604
I've always struggled with this
verse because that sounds so great

00:04:55.635 --> 00:04:57.465
cuz he says he works in all things.

00:04:57.465 --> 00:04:59.145
All things work together for the good.

00:04:59.715 --> 00:05:01.305
But not all things seem good.

00:05:01.665 --> 00:05:02.235
Am I right?

00:05:02.985 --> 00:05:03.915
Anybody else like that?

00:05:03.915 --> 00:05:05.055
Not all things seem good.

00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:07.695
Uh, and and I would say at
times it's hard to see that.

00:05:07.695 --> 00:05:12.974
So this could really be a verse that
seems very negative or hurtful at times.

00:05:13.185 --> 00:05:15.885
But I hope that by the end of this
you're gonna see that God is always

00:05:15.885 --> 00:05:19.275
redeeming that hurt in those all things.

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:20.355
He's always redeeming that.

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:25.575
And so as we try to unpack this today, I
pray that we find not only healing in our

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:28.515
trauma, but I pray that we find strength.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.280
I, I think too many times we wanna
just get through what we're going

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.450
through rather than to actually
become stronger through it.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.270
And I believe that we can
do that through God's.

00:05:39.585 --> 00:05:40.575
Perfect peace.

00:05:40.935 --> 00:05:43.215
So let's pray and then let's
just continue to jump in.

00:05:43.215 --> 00:05:47.355
So, Lord Jesus, we pray today as we
jump into this and as we dive into

00:05:47.355 --> 00:05:50.085
this, Lord, that, number one, that you
are guiding us, the Lord, that your

00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:54.585
presence is amongst us, Lord, because,
um, if we're not ready for this Lord

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.910
today, today, This could be difficult.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.970
Uh, but Lord, I just pray all of us,
Lord, whether we've dealt with trauma

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.720
or not, Lord, that we are here to learn
and that we're here to hear from you.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.960
And I pray the things that we do
discuss is beneficial for each one

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.460
of us to come to know you more and
to experience your perfect peace.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.520
So, Lord, help us continue to overcome all
the mental issues that we've dealt with,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.110
all the things that we begin to discuss.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.690
Lord, help us continue to overcome this.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.520
And so, Lord, we just pray
this in your heavenly name.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.480
Amen.

00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:31.455
So as we think about trauma, um, you
have probably grown up in an era like

00:06:31.455 --> 00:06:34.905
I have where people that go through
things many times, it's just like,

00:06:35.325 --> 00:06:37.155
well, that doesn't seem too bad to them.

00:06:37.425 --> 00:06:40.635
Or if you go through something
difficult, a traumatic event, most

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.215
people are just gonna say this,
that maybe this is how I grew up.

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:44.115
Just suck it up.

00:06:45.285 --> 00:06:47.565
Just grab some dirt, rub it in the wound.

00:06:47.565 --> 00:06:48.645
It'll all be all right.

00:06:48.645 --> 00:06:49.305
Just, just.

00:06:49.905 --> 00:06:50.985
You just need to keep moving.

00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:54.225
And most of the times we're told that
because it's like we don't have time to

00:06:54.225 --> 00:06:56.625
deal with the trauma, the traumatic event.

00:06:56.745 --> 00:06:58.605
We don't have time,
there's too much going on.

00:06:59.145 --> 00:07:01.185
Or people think that it's not a big deal.

00:07:01.435 --> 00:07:05.775
And, and the reason why I say
that is because when we don't deal

00:07:05.775 --> 00:07:08.835
with our trauma, when we don't
deal with what has happened to

00:07:08.835 --> 00:07:12.405
us, We struggle to move past it.

00:07:12.405 --> 00:07:13.425
And so this is what happens.

00:07:13.425 --> 00:07:16.545
We don't just get over trauma,
we don't just move past it.

00:07:16.755 --> 00:07:18.795
We need to heal from it.

00:07:18.975 --> 00:07:22.335
And so I want to kind of set up what
is trauma and kind of explain some

00:07:22.335 --> 00:07:25.425
different definitions of what that
is so we can all understand this.

00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:29.625
And again, I, I, so you know, I'm not
leading all this from just my experience.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.025
There's professionals that have,
have been able to kind of help.

00:07:32.445 --> 00:07:35.234
Come up with these things and help
us understand and, and identify it.

00:07:35.234 --> 00:07:37.335
So there's three types of
trauma and I'm gonna try to go

00:07:37.335 --> 00:07:38.265
through them pretty quickly.

00:07:38.745 --> 00:07:41.025
Um, but number one is acute trauma.

00:07:41.054 --> 00:07:44.745
And this is usually from a one-time
traumatic event, one-time traumatic event.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.885
So you get in a car wreck.

00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:48.434
And that scares the heck out of you.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.125
And that car wreck is something that
will define you, uh, and how you

00:07:52.125 --> 00:07:55.755
wanna ever ride with anybody else that
maybe has been in a wreck with, uh,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.164
you've survived a natural disaster.

00:07:57.164 --> 00:07:59.294
When I lived in Oklahoma, it
was every year it seemed like we

00:07:59.294 --> 00:08:00.645
survived a tornado from somewhere.

00:08:00.645 --> 00:08:03.854
So for some of you, that's, that's not
a one-time thing, but maybe multiple.

00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:06.465
Uh, for some it could
be a complicated birth.

00:08:07.034 --> 00:08:10.664
Um, for others it could be something
as horrible as a one-time rape.

00:08:11.445 --> 00:08:13.245
See these are acute trauma.

00:08:13.485 --> 00:08:18.885
And this one event, this horrible one
event is again, the traumatic experience

00:08:18.885 --> 00:08:20.805
that we get from it is, is, is horrible.

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:22.905
Uh, then you see chronic trauma.

00:08:22.905 --> 00:08:28.875
So chronic trauma is a long-term response
from prolonged or repeated events, a

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:33.015
long-term response from prolonged or
repeated events, so not a one-time event.

00:08:33.135 --> 00:08:37.079
So think about this, if you were bullied
all throughout school, That could have

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:40.109
been traumatic and really is something
that still affects you to this day.

00:08:40.109 --> 00:08:43.469
Racism, something that you've
experienced your whole life.

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:44.729
It's affected you.

00:08:44.729 --> 00:08:48.630
Maybe you're raised in the home
with, with al alcohol abuse, or

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.550
maybe it's even been sexually abuse.

00:08:51.285 --> 00:08:55.395
All these things again, are horrible
ongoing trauma or abuse that

00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:56.415
you've experienced in your life.

00:08:56.655 --> 00:08:58.364
And the last one is complex trauma.

00:08:58.364 --> 00:09:02.295
Complex trauma is really just a
response to multiple and ongoing events.

00:09:02.295 --> 00:09:05.925
It's, it's multiple things that
you've been exposed to over time.

00:09:06.344 --> 00:09:10.454
Um, and again, these can be emotional,
physical, spiritual, uh, as well.

00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:17.385
And so no matter what you've gone through
again, um, that trauma changes you.

00:09:17.985 --> 00:09:21.974
It changes how you view life,
it changes how you treat people.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:25.875
And really even just the deeper
side of it, it really just changes

00:09:25.875 --> 00:09:27.255
sometimes how you view God.

00:09:27.974 --> 00:09:30.584
Because how could a good God
allow these things to happen?

00:09:30.584 --> 00:09:34.724
And that is a difficult
thing to process and realize.

00:09:35.145 --> 00:09:38.655
And so I just want us to stop for
just a minute and just think of

00:09:38.655 --> 00:09:39.735
the heaviness of this subject.

00:09:39.735 --> 00:09:41.685
This is a difficult subject.

00:09:43.005 --> 00:09:46.935
Because I think it's hard to speak
to every person where they are

00:09:46.935 --> 00:09:49.665
because everybody has dealt with
trauma in a different way and

00:09:49.665 --> 00:09:51.015
they're in a different season in it.

00:09:51.705 --> 00:09:53.325
And so I, it is heavy.

00:09:54.194 --> 00:09:55.845
It is heavy, but I know this.

00:09:56.145 --> 00:10:00.405
Why are we talking about it is because
if the church is not a safe place to

00:10:00.405 --> 00:10:04.665
talk about how we heal from trauma,
where we go, then I don't know where

00:10:04.665 --> 00:10:06.555
there's a place to talk about this.

00:10:07.295 --> 00:10:12.045
And, and again, too many times with
trauma is we internally wrestle with it.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:18.390
But we for some reason struggle with
communicating and asking for help

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:24.089
and actually recognizing that we
have been hurt, that we have had a

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:27.089
difficult circumstance happen to us.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.150
So it's, again, it's important
not to compare our trauma.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.220
Everybody's trauma is
horrible no matter what.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:37.740
We're not here to compare whose is
worst, but it is important that we seek.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.920
God for healing no
matter what trauma it is.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.860
So I wanna start us off with, and
this is how I love to be able to

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.220
start off messages, not because I
just wanna relate with you, but I, I

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.540
think it's important for you to know.

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:52.800
Uh, that have, I've experienced trauma in
my life and I'm gonna try to be as brief

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.819
as I can, um, just because this story's
a lot more unpacked and some of you've

00:10:56.819 --> 00:11:01.199
heard this story before, but as a kid,
whenever I was 12, 13, actually from the

00:11:01.199 --> 00:11:04.560
moment I was basically born, we were in
a church and we were in a home church.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.349
Uh, and this home church, we
were around for a long time.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.390
Uh, basically I had all my friends there.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.080
My family obviously was a part
of that, and there began to be

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.620
some conflict between my dad
and the leader of that church.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.010
And, um, this went on for
some time and there began to

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.210
be a little bit of a divide.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.480
But it so happened that the leader
of this church and my dad worked

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.340
at my grandpa's pattern shop.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.020
They worked together side by side.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.800
Um, and that conflict began
to just boil over until one

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.080
day while we're at this shop.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.380
Um, my dad's there, this guy's there.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.040
I'm there.

00:11:38.895 --> 00:11:40.155
Now just picture this again.

00:11:40.155 --> 00:11:43.935
This guy I'd grown up around this
whole time, this leader, um, and he

00:11:43.935 --> 00:11:47.265
was going to get lunch and he asked me
if I wanted to go get lunch with him.

00:11:47.355 --> 00:11:50.835
So I went and got lunch with
him, came back and I remember

00:11:51.135 --> 00:11:52.425
I can picture it today.

00:11:52.905 --> 00:11:56.444
I remember my dad opening the door
and seeing, oh, you guys are back.

00:11:57.045 --> 00:12:01.935
And the next thing I know, this leader
runs at him and begins to beat him.

00:12:02.265 --> 00:12:05.085
And we're not talking about just
punch him, we're talking about

00:12:05.235 --> 00:12:06.975
beating him right in front of me.

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:08.085
Nobody else is around.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:09.795
I'm 1213.

00:12:10.425 --> 00:12:11.175
I don't know what to do.

00:12:12.105 --> 00:12:15.555
I remember rushing to the phone,
trying to call my mom, couldn't

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.755
remember the number to call my mom.

00:12:16.815 --> 00:12:21.435
And finally, finally, I ran
back in and I had to scream as

00:12:21.435 --> 00:12:22.665
loud as I could to say Stop.

00:12:23.325 --> 00:12:26.475
And at that moment, my dad is covered
in blood and my dad went through

00:12:26.475 --> 00:12:27.915
way more than I did in this moment.

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:31.005
But for me, that was
traumatic because not only.

00:12:31.785 --> 00:12:35.535
Was that horrible to see, but
then things began to continue

00:12:35.535 --> 00:12:39.584
to unravel where obviously that
church did not exist much longer.

00:12:39.584 --> 00:12:43.214
There was a lot of conflict between
families and I lost friendships and

00:12:43.935 --> 00:12:48.735
later on, crazy enough that my grandpa
actually fired my dad for some other

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.225
reasons and some other things that
went on, fired my dad, but did not

00:12:51.225 --> 00:12:52.395
fire the guy that beat up my dad.

00:12:53.055 --> 00:12:57.645
Um, so there was family issues, uh,
and, and you just go on and on and so,

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.210
What was the traumatic trauma from it?

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.280
So again, that was a
horrible thing that happened.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.720
But trauma was the response
to what happened for me.

00:13:07.439 --> 00:13:09.000
So how did I respond?

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:09.990
Anger.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:11.850
Anger.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.710
I had a lot of anger.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:14.970
I remember this.

00:13:14.975 --> 00:13:20.520
So from about age 12, 13 till about 23,
which at 23, I gave my life to Jesus.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:26.010
I remember days and nights of
waking up and the only thing I

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.160
could think about this is horrible,
is wanting to kill that man.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.150
That beat my dad up.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.340
That's all I could think
about now, that's horrible.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:36.030
But for 10 years, multiple times, angry.

00:13:36.329 --> 00:13:38.730
So angry, I had so much hatred.

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:43.590
Not only for him, I had so much hatred
for the church and for Jesus because

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.040
we were in a church and there's no way
I'm gonna darken the doors of a church.

00:13:47.505 --> 00:13:50.084
That allowed, you know,
God allowed this to happen.

00:13:50.114 --> 00:13:53.505
So I, I didn't wanna be around Christians,
I didn't wanna be around church.

00:13:53.984 --> 00:13:55.785
I hated that.

00:13:57.314 --> 00:14:01.035
I dealt with a lot of also
identity issues in that moment.

00:14:01.035 --> 00:14:02.385
There was a lot of things
going on in our family.

00:14:02.385 --> 00:14:05.685
My sister and brother had moved outta
the house and lost a lot of my friends,

00:14:05.685 --> 00:14:07.125
and so I went back to public school.

00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:10.905
I was homeschooled at that time and, and
I began to seek everything else to try

00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:13.275
to find peace and I couldn't find it.

00:14:14.564 --> 00:14:15.645
So what did I do?

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:23.729
I had a lot of that for 10 years, and
that trauma affected me a lot, but I

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:27.060
overcame it because Jesus came to my life.

00:14:27.569 --> 00:14:32.130
Jesus came into my life, and it took
a long time to get to that point.

00:14:32.135 --> 00:14:34.050
But whenever I got to that
point, I wanna share this.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.660
Whenever I gave my life
to Jesus, I found peace.

00:14:40.199 --> 00:14:41.010
It took time.

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:42.765
Even giving my life to Jesus.

00:14:42.765 --> 00:14:44.145
It wasn't an instant thing.

00:14:44.415 --> 00:14:49.005
It was a processing to processing
to the point of I got to the point

00:14:49.005 --> 00:14:52.305
where I could look at this man and
actually have compassion for him.

00:14:53.415 --> 00:14:57.705
I could actually, in my heart
learn to forgive him and

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.575
understanding that forgiveness is
more for me than it was for him.

00:15:01.575 --> 00:15:05.055
And, and this is just something for you,
maybe you need to hear this, is that when

00:15:05.055 --> 00:15:08.715
we hold on to unforgiveness, it's really.

00:15:09.165 --> 00:15:12.615
Like drinking poison, expecting
the other person to die.

00:15:13.515 --> 00:15:17.325
And so for me, in that moment,
I was able to forgive him and,

00:15:17.385 --> 00:15:19.185
and there was so much freedom.

00:15:19.695 --> 00:15:22.185
So I'm sharing this with you
to say this, that's my story.

00:15:22.905 --> 00:15:25.575
And that was one of the most
traumatic events in my life, and

00:15:25.575 --> 00:15:28.425
it affected me for 10 years and
it's still a part of my story.

00:15:28.815 --> 00:15:31.275
And God's still redeeming that
story and God's still using

00:15:31.275 --> 00:15:32.775
that story to change lives.

00:15:33.075 --> 00:15:35.895
And I'm so thankful that he was
present in the midst of that.

00:15:37.125 --> 00:15:42.960
So, When we hear that right, it
may sound easy for me and how I

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.450
overcame it, but for you, I don't
know what you've went through.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:46.890
I have no clue.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.270
If someone hurt you and you find it
hard to trust someone for you, it could

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.030
be that you grew up poor and we're not
talking about like poor, like, oh, I

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.170
didn't get to go out to eat all the time.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.100
We're talking about poor, you missed a
lot of meals, you didn't have clothes,

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:05.130
and now you live so fearful and so
traumatic from everything that, that

00:16:05.135 --> 00:16:06.720
all you're so consumed by money.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.710
It could be you that you
were abused as a kid.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.030
I, I don't know what that's like, but
maybe you were abused as a kid and that

00:16:15.035 --> 00:16:20.190
has affected the way in which you view
life and view people and view men, or

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.830
view women or view trusting people.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:28.440
But whatever you're going through,
we can heal through Jesus.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.630
So how do we heal?

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.145
It starts with, Giving it to God.

00:16:32.415 --> 00:16:35.235
So we're gonna look at the Apostle
Paul today, because again, you

00:16:35.235 --> 00:16:38.355
hear my story and how Jesus
changed my life in that situation.

00:16:38.595 --> 00:16:40.185
But I love looking in God's word.

00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:43.995
And we're gonna be looking at the Apostle
Paul, who interestingly enough, if

00:16:43.995 --> 00:16:48.585
you know anything about Paul, Paul was
a faithful follower of Jesus, right?

00:16:48.585 --> 00:16:50.535
Wrote two-thirds of the New Testament.

00:16:50.895 --> 00:16:55.935
This is somebody that God used mightily
and even he dealt with a lot of trauma.

00:16:56.145 --> 00:17:00.000
So when we think about this
trauma, Happens to everyone.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.390
Whether you're a faithful follower
of Jesus or you don't believe in

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.210
Jesus, trauma still happens to us all.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.980
And when we look at his example,
we're gonna see some great

00:17:10.985 --> 00:17:12.600
things that I think will help us.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.610
But I wanna just mention
a few things there.

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:17.700
In your notes, I've listed multiple
verses and sometimes we put some

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.840
things in your notes, multiple verses
in those notes, um, for you to go and

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.150
look at Paul's story more in detail.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.550
But I just wanna summarize
those verses real quick.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.590
Number one, he went from city to city
where people were plotting to kill him.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.560
He was stoned, he was beaten.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.060
He was shipwrecked.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:37.680
He was bitten by a snake.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.210
He was falsely in prison.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:44.070
And the list goes on from the moment
of his conversion, he endured abuse.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.420
And we're gonna learn three things
about what Paul did in order to heal

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.240
from his trauma in the midst of that.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.520
And so the first thing that we
need to realize is that we need

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.170
to process the pain of our trauma.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.670
Um, and we're gonna see where Paul begins
to process this out a little bit deeper.

00:18:00.584 --> 00:18:01.635
But I want you to think about this.

00:18:01.635 --> 00:18:05.024
When we need to process our
trauma, the first thing that we

00:18:05.024 --> 00:18:06.614
need to do is acknowledge it.

00:18:06.675 --> 00:18:09.885
And that sounds very logical
in order to process something.

00:18:09.889 --> 00:18:13.485
But we need to acknowledge that
we went through something and

00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:15.014
we are experiencing trauma.

00:18:15.635 --> 00:18:17.504
I, I think of this, this way.

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:25.814
If you broke your leg and you go, eh, I'm
not gonna act like I have a broken leg.

00:18:27.074 --> 00:18:28.364
Is your leg ever gonna heal?

00:18:28.875 --> 00:18:31.185
It's gonna heal incorrectly,
it's gonna be painful.

00:18:31.575 --> 00:18:34.365
If it's not set right, you're maybe
not ever gonna walk on it again.

00:18:34.365 --> 00:18:40.245
It's always gonna be there until you do
something about it, to heal it, to to go

00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:42.285
to the doctor and address the situation.

00:18:43.425 --> 00:18:47.775
And so we need to understand
that if we don't heal, then we

00:18:47.775 --> 00:18:48.975
begin to suppress the wound.

00:18:48.975 --> 00:18:52.485
And when we suppress the wound,
we begin to try to cope with

00:18:52.485 --> 00:18:54.765
it by using other things.

00:18:54.765 --> 00:18:56.475
So we need to acknowledge.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.120
That we've been abused, and that could
be, you know, that we have trauma, right?

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.920
It could be from abuse,
it could be from rape.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.880
It could be from being abandoned or
mistreated, but we need to acknowledge it.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:12.000
And the reason why we typically don't
acknowledge it, not only to ourselves, but

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.650
to other people, is because we're afraid
We're, we're afraid to be vulnerable.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.480
We feel like we're helpless.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.870
We think it's better to just
ignore it and not talk about it.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.880
I would say this for me.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.060
I was afraid to admit it
because I felt like I was weak.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.840
I should just, I was that person that
told myself I should just suck it up.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:31.890
I should just put dirt on it.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.380
I should just move forward and
figure it out on my own and do

00:19:34.385 --> 00:19:37.140
this on my own and just get over
it, and I never could get over it.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.660
So what happens when we don't address
and acknowledge what we've went through

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.650
and process it, instead of seeking
connection with other people to process

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:50.640
it, we really prioritize protection,
protecting what we've went through.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.070
And so we never let people in.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.070
Again, we don't heal in isolation.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.170
We heal best in community.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.980
So why do you guys hear me
talk all the time about Inspire

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.480
Groups, which is our small groups?

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.040
We talk about our inspire groups because
it's a place where we can be real and,

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.930
and things that we walk through in life.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.410
Difficult things that we walk
through in life that you can lay

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.940
it out there without judgment.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.150
You can have people that will
pray for you and encourage you.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.780
The Bible even talks about this,
that we can come together and we can

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.379
confess our faults and our struggles
to one another, and when we pray for

00:20:25.379 --> 00:20:28.949
one another that the Bible says that
we will be healed when we do that.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.460
So we need to continue to seek Jesus.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.470
So go to two Corinthians chapter 11.

00:20:34.649 --> 00:20:35.909
It should be up on the screen as well.

00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:37.620
Second Corinthians chapter 11.

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:42.179
We're gonna read verses 23 through
28 together, and we're gonna see how

00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:46.800
Paul began to process and acknowledge
the traumatic events he went through,

00:20:46.804 --> 00:20:50.175
which again, He's speaking to a group
of people who have claimed some things,

00:20:50.175 --> 00:20:52.755
and he's kind of saying, Hey, I've kind
of had it a little bit worse than you.

00:20:52.755 --> 00:20:54.795
So here's where it's, we're
just gonna start in verse 23.

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:58.665
So second Corinthians chapter
11, starting in verse 23.

00:20:59.445 --> 00:21:04.755
It says this, if I can find it here,
it says, are they servants of Christ?

00:21:04.965 --> 00:21:06.795
He says, am I talking like a madman?

00:21:07.785 --> 00:21:11.565
He says I'm a better one with
far more laborers and many more

00:21:11.565 --> 00:21:16.335
imprisonments and far worse beatings
and many more near-death experiences.

00:21:16.635 --> 00:21:19.305
He says this, he begins to describe
and acknowledge his trauma,

00:21:19.305 --> 00:21:20.325
the things he's went through.

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:23.505
He says, five times I received 40 lashes.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:24.340
Minus one.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.330
I wanna stop right there.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.770
You wanna know the reason why Paul
received only 39 slashes, which I always

00:21:29.775 --> 00:21:31.210
love how he says it's 40 minus one.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:31.510
I don't know.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.790
But anyways, you wanna
know why he received 39?

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.080
Because if he was to happen to die at
39, it wouldn't be considered murder.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.890
But if they hit him 40 times and he
died, then it would be considered murder.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.520
So they did it 39 times basically to say,
we're gonna get you close to death, and

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.870
if you happen to die, it's not our fault.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:50.890
This is just a, you know, typical
punishment, but five times.

00:21:52.095 --> 00:21:56.835
He received 40 lashes, minus one, so 39
he says three times he was beaten with

00:21:56.835 --> 00:22:00.254
rods once he was received a stoning.

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:02.195
Three times he was shipped, correct.

00:22:02.925 --> 00:22:05.985
He says, I've spent a night and a day
in the open sea and on frequent journeys

00:22:05.985 --> 00:22:10.455
I faced dangers from rivers and dangers
from robbers and dangers from my own

00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:14.085
people, and dangers from gentiles and
dangers in the city, and dangers in

00:22:14.085 --> 00:22:17.355
the wilderness, and dangers at sea,
and dangers among false brothers.

00:22:17.715 --> 00:22:22.275
He says, toil and hard hardships, many
sleepless nights, hunger and thirst, often

00:22:22.515 --> 00:22:25.155
without food cold and without clothing.

00:22:25.395 --> 00:22:27.105
Not to mention other things.

00:22:27.375 --> 00:22:31.785
There is the daily pressure on me
and my concerns for the church.

00:22:32.775 --> 00:22:36.765
You know, that caught me at the end
of the verse here on verse 28, that

00:22:36.765 --> 00:22:41.655
Paul even mentions here the pressures
on him and the concerns of the church.

00:22:42.255 --> 00:22:45.705
You know, that really started
making me think as a pastor and

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:46.695
some of the traumatic things.

00:22:46.695 --> 00:22:48.465
I feel like that as a pastor
I've went through that.

00:22:48.465 --> 00:22:51.955
I haven't really recognized
recently how traumatic it has

00:22:51.955 --> 00:22:53.505
been, and that was even for me.

00:22:53.505 --> 00:22:56.025
As I'm looking at trauma, I'm thinking
of the one time event that I can always

00:22:56.025 --> 00:22:58.965
think of, but even you maybe sitting
in this room going, you know, I haven't

00:22:58.965 --> 00:23:00.015
went through anything traumatic.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:05.220
Have you ever had a friend abandon
you and, and you just kind of moved

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:10.920
on and not really recognized that it
truly hurt that they would abandon you?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.639
I mean, have you, I I don't know if you
have that, that that's happened to me.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.970
Those are moments where I realize that
truly affects the way I trust another

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.820
friend and the way I view other people.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:26.550
And so when I think about this,
Paul was even burdened and affected

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:29.220
over just ministry and the people.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.740
So as we look at this, Paul had a lot
of traumatic events in his life, right?

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.680
It's hard for us maybe to compare,
but we're not here to compare.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.680
But he mentions this and
you see this verse I believe

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.000
there on your paper as well.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.530
He says, we were completely overwhelmed
beyond our strength so that we

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.630
even despaired of life itself.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:53.070
And so even some of the trauma that
Paul went through, even he at times

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.680
wondered if he could continue to move on.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.610
So I don't know if you've
ever hurt so deeply, you've

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:00.629
wondered if you can move on.

00:24:00.659 --> 00:24:02.610
Just know Paul relates with you.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.250
He understands what you've went through.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.810
So what did Paul do?

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:07.590
He talked about it.

00:24:07.595 --> 00:24:08.430
He acknowledged it.

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:09.149
He wrote about it.

00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:10.680
He processed it.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.870
And so I encourage you
to find a safe place.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.190
Maybe that isn't Inspire group.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.750
Maybe that's a close friended to say, hey.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:20.070
Here's what I've struggled with, I've
wrestled with in my life, and, and it's

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:24.720
affected my ability to trust people or my
affected my ability to, to not be consumed

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.390
with money or to affected my ability.

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:31.320
That now, because I grew up with
angry, abusive parents, that now I

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.910
struggle to be angry and abusive.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.390
The, see, that's a tough conversation that
maybe you need to have with a counselor.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.020
Maybe you need to have somebody
that you know will be able to

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.460
help you and encourage you.

00:24:42.495 --> 00:24:44.804
Again, we need to
remember not to ignore it.

00:24:44.955 --> 00:24:49.304
We have to acknowledge it and
process it in order to heal,

00:24:49.544 --> 00:24:50.985
so we move on from that, right?

00:24:50.985 --> 00:24:54.584
The first one was is that we need
to acknowledge and process it,

00:24:54.975 --> 00:24:56.264
and the next one is so important.

00:24:56.264 --> 00:24:59.594
We need to prayfully press
into God with our trauma.

00:25:00.375 --> 00:25:01.725
See, we have two options.

00:25:01.754 --> 00:25:05.324
When we go through traumatic
events, we can either run to God.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.230
We can run away from God.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.600
And, and just so you know, I think at
times as a believer, when I've walked

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.530
through traumatic events in my life, I,
I feel like I've just not gone anywhere.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.230
I feel like I've not gone backwards
and I'm not running to God.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.610
I'm just trying to
figure it out on my own.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.120
That's the, you know, flesh side of me
that just thinks, I just need to figure

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.800
this out on my own because I'm a man.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:27.690
And men don't cry.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:31.800
And men don't, you know, they,
they just, they just handle things.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.120
They act like a wound's not a big deal.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:38.850
What ends up happening, and it usually
happens, all of a sudden I break down.

00:25:39.689 --> 00:25:42.750
And for many of us, it's because we're
internally struggling and physically

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.870
we begin to break down and mentally
we begin to break down and we need

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:50.639
to acknowledge it by going to God,
not just trying to handle it on our

00:25:50.639 --> 00:25:53.370
own by prayerfully going to God.

00:25:53.939 --> 00:25:55.260
And so we look at an example here.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.540
You're gonna see this again,
two Corinthians 12, eight.

00:25:58.185 --> 00:26:00.375
Paul mentions this, he says,
I pleaded with the Lord three

00:26:00.375 --> 00:26:01.485
times that it would lead me.

00:26:01.485 --> 00:26:05.625
So just to kind of set this up, Paul the
apostle had something else happen to him.

00:26:05.865 --> 00:26:06.915
He didn't even list on that.

00:26:06.915 --> 00:26:08.835
It says that he has a thorn in his side.

00:26:09.255 --> 00:26:11.175
Many don't know what that thorn was.

00:26:11.715 --> 00:26:14.355
Some of you may have a thorn in your side
and they're sitting right next to you.

00:26:14.355 --> 00:26:15.225
Don't elbow them.

00:26:15.975 --> 00:26:16.365
Okay?

00:26:16.695 --> 00:26:18.375
Um, good job over the Rhine.

00:26:18.375 --> 00:26:18.975
I saw that.

00:26:19.485 --> 00:26:24.480
Um, What Paul had was something
that was very painful, something

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.530
that was tormenting him, and three
different times he went to the Lord.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.140
And when you begin to study a
little bit deeper into that text,

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.950
these three times wasn't just
like, okay, Lord, take this away.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:35.610
Take it away.

00:26:35.615 --> 00:26:36.030
Take it away.

00:26:36.035 --> 00:26:40.260
It wasn't three times in one
prayer, what many believe is

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:42.690
it was three seasons of prayer.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.910
He was being tormented by this
thorn, whatever that thorn was.

00:26:48.915 --> 00:26:53.115
He began to pray and pray and
pray for it to be removed.

00:26:55.125 --> 00:26:56.565
And here's what God said.

00:26:58.695 --> 00:27:01.665
God's response to Paul was this, and
you'll see this in second Corinthians

00:27:01.665 --> 00:27:06.915
12, nine through 10, he said, but he said
to me, my grace is sufficient for you,

00:27:07.725 --> 00:27:09.975
for my power is perfected in weakness.

00:27:09.975 --> 00:27:14.835
Therefore, I will most gladly boast
all the more about my weaknesses so

00:27:14.835 --> 00:27:16.635
that Christ power may reside in to me.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:18.570
And so here's what Paul says.

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:23.430
I take pleasure in my weaknesses,
my insults, my hardships, my

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.950
persecutions, and in my difficulties.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:30.930
Just add in there in my trauma
for the sake of Christ, for when

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.060
I am weak, then I am strong.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:38.100
See, the Bible says that we
can cast all of our cares onto

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.200
the Lord for he cares for us.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:45.000
So we prayfully seek Jesus
when healing from trauma.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:49.590
Recognizing, acknowledging it, and
then casting it over to the Lord.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.710
So God is basically saying to Paul, and
he's saying to us, in the midst of your

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.260
trauma, you may be weak, but God isn't.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:27:59.610
He is strong.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:04.800
If you're figuring out, how do I overcome
this, how do I move on, how do I heal?

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:09.210
Jesus is the only one that will
be able to help you do that.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.160
You will not be able to do it on your own.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.800
So we need to go to Jesus.

00:28:15.135 --> 00:28:18.105
We need to go to Jesus, and we need
to remember that nothing can change

00:28:18.105 --> 00:28:23.475
our past, but God can heal not only
our broken hearts and our broken

00:28:23.475 --> 00:28:25.305
lives, but he can change your future.

00:28:25.845 --> 00:28:29.175
Guys, I, I'll just tell you this, and
Brittany knows this more than anybody,

00:28:29.445 --> 00:28:34.065
the freedom in which I received when I
began to overcome the trauma in which

00:28:34.065 --> 00:28:36.675
I experienced as a kid changed my life.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.360
It changed my life.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:45.330
Too many of us are living with the burden
from past traumatic experiences that

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:49.410
we are still processing to this day, no
matter if it's been 20 years or one month.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.710
And it is affecting how you live and how
you treat people, and how you experience

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.050
the abundant life that God has for you.

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:03.930
God's perfect peace and
so we need to pursue God.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.380
We need to.

00:29:04.979 --> 00:29:05.610
Go to him.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.919
And so Psalm 38 or 34 18 says this, the
Lord is near the brokenhearted and he

00:29:10.919 --> 00:29:12.780
saves those who are crushed in spirit.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.760
And so what, what God is saying
is, is this, what that Psalm is

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.510
saying is this, that if you are
broken, if you're struggling,

00:29:21.629 --> 00:29:23.580
God is right there next to you.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.379
He is ready to save you.

00:29:25.949 --> 00:29:27.120
He's ready to help you.

00:29:27.705 --> 00:29:30.075
And so the last thing that
we see here from Paul, right?

00:29:30.075 --> 00:29:34.155
So Paul not only acknowledged that he
began to express everything he went

00:29:34.155 --> 00:29:39.315
through, but he began to cast his cares
on the Lord three different seasons.

00:29:39.525 --> 00:29:45.705
In that instance, he went to the Lord, and
it's a reminder for us that we need to go

00:29:45.705 --> 00:29:47.145
to the Lord and we need to go to the Lord.

00:29:47.145 --> 00:29:49.725
And sometimes the Lord is gonna
say, my grace is sufficient for you.

00:29:50.025 --> 00:29:53.835
Sometimes the Lord's gonna remove
that thorn and he's gonna change it.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.620
The last one is, is hard to maybe for
us to take home and, and if you're

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.110
not ready for this, maybe it's a
season where you're still working

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:04.920
on healing, but as you begin to seek
Jesus, here's what he's going to do.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.830
We're going to pursue
purpose in our trauma.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.790
That goes back to that Romans
A 28 we started with, right?

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:17.190
God uses all things right for
the good of those who love him.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.960
It's hard to see sometimes in these
events how God can use those for good.

00:30:22.784 --> 00:30:26.534
This is where we're gonna begin
to see that there's a purpose that

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.195
God will take again, not that he
allowed that to happen, as though

00:30:30.195 --> 00:30:31.844
he's like, oh, I'm glad you did that.

00:30:31.995 --> 00:30:34.185
He's going to use
whatever happened to you.

00:30:34.814 --> 00:30:37.574
He didn't say, I wanted
that to happen to you.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.574
He's going to use it for something good.

00:30:41.054 --> 00:30:43.735
So even Paul after these
traumatic events, right?

00:30:43.745 --> 00:30:45.794
Going back to he was beaten,
he was shipwrecked, he was

00:30:45.794 --> 00:30:47.054
stoned, he was left for dead.

00:30:47.564 --> 00:30:48.465
Second Corinthians.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.030
One verses two through four says this.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.110
This is Paul speaking.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.530
Blessed be the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.990
mercies and the God of all comfort.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:04.980
He comforts us in our afflictions so
that we may be able to comfort those who

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.960
are in any kind of affliction through
the comfort we have received from God.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.140
I wanna say that again, and you need to
hear this, something we need to hear.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:21.660
As God comforts us in our affliction
and what we're dealing with, he is now

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:25.110
giving us that comfort so that we can
comfort others who have walked through

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:28.110
the same traumatic events that we have.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.110
It is hard to see that.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:36.570
It's so hard to see that God wants
to use that, but here's really what

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:42.030
what he's saying is that as you are
processing your pain, As you are coming

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.540
to God and you're healing and you're
receiving his perfect peace, you can

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:50.040
walk along some alongside someone else
who hasn't healed, or maybe you're in

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.300
the process of healing and you can walk
alongside someone who is in the process

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.960
of healing and they can realize they're
not the only ones that were affected.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.420
They're not the only ones
that have gone through this.

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:04.290
And when it's so nice, I don't know
what, it sounds so bad, but it's

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:08.010
nice to know that we have company
that we're not the only ones.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.460
It's nice to know that we have
somebody that is trying to figure

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:15.720
this out as well and trying to
seek Jesus for healing, right?

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.330
And it's so hard to see this
in the midst of our pain.

00:32:19.379 --> 00:32:22.950
Um, and we just need to
remember, this is so important.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.010
If you need help, if you need to,
to reach out to a friend, go to

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.420
Inspire group, go to a counselor.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.990
There is, it's not weakness to seek help.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.790
It's actually strong.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:33.750
It's strength, right?

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:35.580
It is not a sign of weakness.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.290
When we get help, it's a sign of strength.

00:32:38.805 --> 00:32:41.745
And so one of the things that as
we begin to study through this and,

00:32:42.165 --> 00:32:45.705
um, the, the church that we, uh,
basically we followed is we begin

00:32:45.705 --> 00:32:48.675
to learn a lot of this series and be
able to bring this series to you guys.

00:32:49.005 --> 00:32:52.245
Um, he was reaching out to a counselor
who was looking over his messages,

00:32:52.245 --> 00:32:56.175
and he made this one statement to the
pastor that I think is so important

00:32:56.175 --> 00:32:57.165
that we need to take as well.

00:32:57.165 --> 00:32:58.065
This is what the counselor said.

00:32:58.275 --> 00:33:01.575
Don't just tell your
people that they can heal.

00:33:02.775 --> 00:33:06.435
Tell them and remind them
that they can be stronger.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:10.320
That they can be stronger after healing.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.830
And I wanna share with you James
chapter one, verses two through four.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.629
This is what James says.

00:33:15.635 --> 00:33:18.810
Consider it great joy, my brothers and
sisters, when you experience various

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:23.490
trials because you know that the testing
of your faith produces endurance and let

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:27.330
endurance have its full effect so that you
may be mature, complete, lacking nothing.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:30.840
Here's what he's saying.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:34.260
He's saying that no matter what you're
going through that, that you're not

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.550
supposed to just get through it.

00:33:36.435 --> 00:33:40.185
You're going to come out stronger
on the other side, stronger and

00:33:40.185 --> 00:33:44.055
trusting the Lord stronger and the
ability to be able to affect those

00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:45.555
around you and to help them heal.

00:33:46.095 --> 00:33:51.435
So the question then, you may be asking
this, right, have I completely healed

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.695
from the traumatic event I went through?

00:33:52.755 --> 00:33:56.445
I, I would say yes, but there's
moments I still wrestle with it.

00:33:57.015 --> 00:34:00.015
And, and, and walking through
this series and walking through

00:34:00.015 --> 00:34:02.145
this week, I had to relive that.

00:34:02.145 --> 00:34:03.285
It was, it was difficult.

00:34:04.185 --> 00:34:08.775
You know what I've even realized
even more so is that I've, I, in this

00:34:08.775 --> 00:34:12.585
series, like I, I'm realizing I've went
through probably some more traumatic

00:34:12.585 --> 00:34:13.875
events that I didn't wanna recognize.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.835
I wasn't acknowledging it.

00:34:15.795 --> 00:34:16.784
I wasn't acknowledging it.

00:34:17.175 --> 00:34:22.455
And when I begin to acknowledge it, do you
know that acknowledging the trauma hurts?

00:34:23.025 --> 00:34:24.615
And the reason why we don't
wanna acknowledge it is

00:34:24.615 --> 00:34:25.695
because we don't wanna hurt.

00:34:26.325 --> 00:34:28.575
But do you know that
ignoring it hurts worse?

00:34:29.235 --> 00:34:29.835
You need to hear that.

00:34:29.835 --> 00:34:30.675
Somebody needs to hear that.

00:34:31.755 --> 00:34:35.355
Acknowledging it hurts, but it hurts
worse when we don't acknowledge

00:34:35.415 --> 00:34:38.865
what we've went through is
difficult and that we need help.

00:34:40.065 --> 00:34:45.165
So as we move into invitation, I
always talk about what is invitation.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:46.485
We talked about some heavy stuff today.

00:34:46.485 --> 00:34:49.665
I didn't hear a lot of laughter because
there wasn't a lot to laugh about.

00:34:49.665 --> 00:34:50.415
This is deep.

00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:54.405
Uh, but I, I, during invitation,
I, I would say this as a role

00:34:54.405 --> 00:34:59.220
of a pastor and you think about,
um, What's my role each week?

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:02.220
It's not just to, and I was actually
talking Brittany about this.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.640
It's not just to get information across
so that you are more knowledgeable

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.930
with life and that's great.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.870
Communicating on Sunday mornings
is all about transformation.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.650
Taking what we've heard and
beginning, not only to process

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:17.970
it, but beginning to apply it.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.210
And so I would say this, and I've
heard this from other people before,

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:24.630
and I don't know who quoted this
originally, but the role of a pastor.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.654
The role of a pastor, The comfort,
those who are hurting, right?

00:35:29.915 --> 00:35:35.775
The comfort, those who are hurting, but
to also spur on those who are comfortable.

00:35:36.255 --> 00:35:37.575
This is another way to say it, right?

00:35:37.634 --> 00:35:40.335
To comfort the afflicted and
to afflict the comfortable.

00:35:40.725 --> 00:35:45.195
Sometimes it's easy just to be
comfortable to stay with not

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.565
acknowledging our trauma and just
living with that the rest of our lives.

00:35:47.565 --> 00:35:51.225
Maybe you need to be spurred on
to actually address it, right?

00:35:51.675 --> 00:35:56.115
And so whether trauma is the result of
something you did or somebody else did.

00:35:56.685 --> 00:36:00.075
Here's the thing that we need to
remember, that pursuing God for

00:36:00.075 --> 00:36:02.475
healing is our responsibility.

00:36:02.805 --> 00:36:03.705
Lemme just say it this way.

00:36:03.915 --> 00:36:09.645
Pursuing God for healing is your
responsibility, and what I mean by that

00:36:09.645 --> 00:36:12.585
is God has already went the full hundred.

00:36:12.585 --> 00:36:17.685
He is here and present and ready
to walk with you through this.

00:36:18.555 --> 00:36:23.115
It's up to you to say, Jesus, I need you.

00:36:24.165 --> 00:36:24.495
That's it.

00:36:24.585 --> 00:36:25.245
Surrender.

00:36:26.595 --> 00:36:27.975
How does the healing process happen?

00:36:28.634 --> 00:36:32.505
I mean, you all have been through
some major probably injuries.

00:36:33.404 --> 00:36:37.065
It happens one day at a time,
and sometimes in the healing

00:36:37.065 --> 00:36:38.835
process there is a lot of pain.

00:36:39.585 --> 00:36:47.234
But on the other side of complete
healing is this freedom, this peace,

00:36:47.415 --> 00:36:49.634
this perfect piece, this shalom, shalom.

00:36:49.634 --> 00:36:52.395
We keep talking about that God gives us.

00:36:54.134 --> 00:37:02.205
It's crazy that God can use these
things for good, but God uses

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:05.265
everything for good, for our good
and for the good of those around you.

00:37:05.265 --> 00:37:09.015
And so, just so you know, as a pastor,
if you've went through a traumatic event,

00:37:09.015 --> 00:37:13.695
if, if you consistently go through a
traumatic event, cuz I know you do.

00:37:14.775 --> 00:37:15.225
I hear you.

00:37:16.095 --> 00:37:16.545
I see you.

00:37:18.585 --> 00:37:19.065
I'm here.

00:37:19.545 --> 00:37:20.325
I'm praying for you.

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:26.549
Um, and I want to continue to help you
however I can, and I wanna do that.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.060
And so I'm gonna pray for
us and we're gonna take some

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.200
time to just go to the Lord.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:41.130
So Lord Jesus, thank you for who you are,
God, that you would even take some of

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:42.960
the darkest moments in our life, Lord.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:48.120
And you would find a way to redeem that
story and the Lord to help us heal.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.009
And so, Lord, I'm praying
for the person in this room.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:56.190
That maybe came in not knowing much about
this message and today, Lord, maybe this

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.600
message is speaking directly to them.

00:37:57.779 --> 00:38:09.570
Lord, I pray that you help them process
it, acknowledge it, seek you, and

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.180
then begin to use Lord that healing.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.330
That they'll receive for
the benefit of others.

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:19.560
God, I'll also pray for those
in the room that may be like,

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.380
okay, what's this for me?

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:23.790
I haven't been through
anything traumatic, Lord.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:28.140
I'm praying for that person, Lord, to take
what they've learned because all around

00:38:28.145 --> 00:38:34.500
them there are people who've gone through
so much and they need to hear that there

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.490
is a hope and there is a help in Jesus.

00:38:40.515 --> 00:38:45.945
So Lord, just minister to our hearts
and help us, help us continue to heal.

00:38:47.685 --> 00:38:50.295
And as we continue to pray, you
guys, I, I want everybody just look

00:38:50.295 --> 00:38:52.365
up here as we continue to pray.

00:38:53.775 --> 00:38:58.185
I, I'm, I'm telling you,
this is a place of safety.

00:38:58.695 --> 00:39:02.025
This is a place where
we can heal together.

00:39:02.475 --> 00:39:05.085
And so I, whether you wanna participate
in this or not, that's up to you.

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:09.180
But if you need prayer, if you've walked
through something difficult, you just,

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.350
you don't have to admit what it is.

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.689
If you've walked through something
difficult, you're dealing with just

00:39:12.689 --> 00:39:17.580
a struggle that you need prayer for,
we wanna pray for you as a church.

00:39:17.759 --> 00:39:22.169
We believe, when we pray, God hears us.

00:39:22.799 --> 00:39:26.310
And this may be the first step
for you to begin to overcome

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:27.419
whatever you're walking through.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.680
So here's my challenge again.

00:39:28.859 --> 00:39:29.790
Nobody raises their hand.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:30.600
It's totally fine.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:31.439
We're not gonna pray for you.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:32.850
That sounds really bad.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:33.720
That's not what I mean.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.700
We're gonna pray for you even
though you're not raising your hand.

00:39:36.029 --> 00:39:40.380
But if you're willing to have somebody
pray for you and just admit right now

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.049
that you need prayer, I don't If it's
not even trauma, if it's just something

00:39:43.049 --> 00:39:46.350
in your life, I just want you to lift
your hand up and we'll pray for you.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.200
We're gonna take some time to
pray for anybody that needs

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.310
prayer specifically in this room.

00:39:50.339 --> 00:39:51.810
And that's a bold ask.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:57.600
And I know that's hard, and you wanna
know why that I asked this and I

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.259
tried to do this all the time, not
because I'm trying to set the example.

00:40:01.995 --> 00:40:05.985
But guys, I need prayer to
let me be the first person.

00:40:05.985 --> 00:40:06.435
Thank you.

00:40:08.445 --> 00:40:08.805
Thank you.

00:40:11.655 --> 00:40:14.445
There's more people than we know
that are walking through difficult

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:21.915
things and it takes acknowledging,
it's hard cuz it makes us vulnerable.

00:40:23.155 --> 00:40:24.375
It makes us feel weak.

00:40:25.935 --> 00:40:28.725
But I'm so thankful God's word
says this to that when I am weak.

00:40:29.325 --> 00:40:30.045
Oh, he is strong.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.870
So, you know, in the admitting those
of us that raised our hands, and

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.990
those of you that raised your hands
and your hearts, cuz I know you did.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:44.190
Do you know in the middle of that weakness
that God's presence is so close to you.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.670
But if you'll never admit your
need for God to help you heal,

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:49.620
you'll stay where you are.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:54.060
That's not an insult, that's
an encouragement, that's

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.290
a spurring on for you.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.420
So here's what we're gonna do.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.730
We're gonna take some time to pray.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:03.120
For those of you that raised your hand and
those of you that didn't, but thank you.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.890
Those of you that raised
your hand and prayed.

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:05.730
So let's just pray.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.860
Those of you that are sitting in
your seats, just begin to pray

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:08.880
for those that raised their hand.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.920
Begin to pray for those
who in this room needed to.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.350
So let's just all begin to pray and
just take a minute or two to do that.

00:42:09.315 --> 00:42:10.245
Lord Jesus this.

00:42:12.735 --> 00:42:16.425
We don't come to a service like this,
Lord, to put on a show or a performance

00:42:16.425 --> 00:42:18.645
or just to go through a routine, Lord.

00:42:19.455 --> 00:42:21.945
We are here to meet you.

00:42:23.115 --> 00:42:30.884
We're here to see how you can continue
to meet us, where we are in our broken

00:42:30.884 --> 00:42:36.105
state, and how you can help us heal
and how you can help us grow in our

00:42:36.105 --> 00:42:40.425
faith and how you can help us Lord
live in this world that at times is

00:42:40.425 --> 00:42:44.235
so heavy, and Lord, I'm so thankful.

00:42:45.975 --> 00:42:47.085
For a church that prays.

00:42:47.085 --> 00:42:52.965
I'm so thankful for a church that Lord,
we respond and that we begin to just

00:42:53.865 --> 00:42:56.985
be honest before you Lord, and I just
pray for those who raise their hand.

00:42:56.985 --> 00:42:57.975
I pray for myself, Lord.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.075
I pray for those who
struggle to raise their hand.

00:43:00.075 --> 00:43:04.755
Lord, I know there are people
in this room that is hard to

00:43:04.755 --> 00:43:07.515
be open and honest with others.

00:43:09.105 --> 00:43:11.595
God, I pray that you meet
them right where they're at.

00:43:12.674 --> 00:43:15.615
Lord, I pray that as they are
acknowledging, Lord, what they've walked

00:43:15.615 --> 00:43:16.965
through, that you'll bring healing.

00:43:18.015 --> 00:43:21.765
Lord, I pray that they will take that
step towards healing by saying yes to

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:24.134
you and asking you to walk alongside.

00:43:25.245 --> 00:43:29.715
Lord, I pray that whatever it is, Lord,
that they're walking through, that

00:43:30.255 --> 00:43:33.555
your presence will just be with them
and Lord that our church, through our

00:43:33.555 --> 00:43:36.435
inspire groups, then just through our
Sunday service, Lord, just through.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.020
Our friendships, Lord, that we'll
be able to walk alongside one

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.060
another as life is difficult.

00:43:43.799 --> 00:43:48.779
God, we know that you are good, and
we just pray that you continue to just

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:51.089
show that goodness to us every day

00:43:54.149 --> 00:43:55.080
as we continue to pray.

00:43:55.085 --> 00:43:56.850
There's one last thing
that I want to mention.

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:59.220
One last thing, and I
wanna share it this way.

00:43:59.775 --> 00:44:00.884
And I think this is the perfect time.

00:44:01.815 --> 00:44:05.475
There's many ways to share the
love and the hope of Jesus.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.725
Many different ways to share
the love and help of Jesus.

00:44:08.565 --> 00:44:13.694
But there's a, an example that, um, I,
I'm reminded of, and it's called three

00:44:13.694 --> 00:44:16.545
circles, and it's this big circle in it.

00:44:16.545 --> 00:44:19.245
I should, you know, see the planner in me
would've had this thing up on the screen,

00:44:19.245 --> 00:44:20.475
but I'm just gonna describe it to you.

00:44:20.865 --> 00:44:23.444
The three circles is just this big
circle, and there's three different

00:44:23.444 --> 00:44:27.404
points on this circle, and it
talks about God's original design.

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:31.529
It was for each one of us to live in
God's perfect peace with him, right?

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:34.620
Obviously at the beginning of
creation, that was the plan.

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.319
And at the end, in eternity,
it's gonna be God's presence

00:44:37.325 --> 00:44:39.149
and perfect experience with him.

00:44:40.049 --> 00:44:42.060
So that was God's original design.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:45.240
But that all changed when
sin came into the world.

00:44:45.245 --> 00:44:48.480
Some of that sins us, some of
our sin, sins of other people.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:52.439
And you know that sin leads
us to brokenness, right?

00:44:52.439 --> 00:44:56.520
So God's original design
sin leads to brokenness.

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.330
That's the next point.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.650
And that brokenness.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.520
This is what happens.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:06.270
Brokenness can be trauma, brokenness
can be abuse, and, and it can

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.670
be pain and it can be suffering.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.290
And typically what happens when we go
through brokenness, and this is the

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:14.940
part again, I, I wish I had the diagram.

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.000
You begin to see this brokenness in all
these different lines that go off and

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.350
it's ways that people are trying to cope.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:24.240
We try to cope from our
brokenness by drinking.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.040
We try to cope with our brokenness.

00:45:27.315 --> 00:45:30.105
By just acting like a different
person around somebody else

00:45:30.885 --> 00:45:31.965
than we are with other people.

00:45:32.865 --> 00:45:36.765
We try to cope with our
brokenness by ignoring it and

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:38.235
by a number of other things.

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:39.435
You know what happens with that?

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:39.585
Right?

00:45:39.585 --> 00:45:41.775
When we're broken, we chose
everything else but God.

00:45:42.495 --> 00:45:47.745
But here's what helps us overcome that
brokenness, and it's the next point.

00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:48.585
It's the gospel.

00:45:49.545 --> 00:45:53.775
It's where we repent and we
believe that Jesus Christ, the

00:45:53.775 --> 00:45:55.665
son of God, came to this earth.

00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:01.650
To live a perfect life, the one
we couldn't live, to die on a

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:07.710
cross and to suffer in our place
so that we could be forgiven and

00:46:07.715 --> 00:46:09.840
experience God's perfect peace again.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.970
I mean, that's an amazing story.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.540
So to come from the brokenness
that we're talking about today and

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.080
to, to repent and believe in Jesus
and the hope of the gospel, guess

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.850
what happens when we receive Jesus?

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.990
We begin to experience God's
original design this circle.

00:46:26.655 --> 00:46:28.365
Where God created us to be.

00:46:28.365 --> 00:46:32.265
And here's the thing, as as believers,
that may be you at times where you

00:46:32.505 --> 00:46:35.115
lead to brokenness with sin, even after
you've given your life to Christ and

00:46:35.115 --> 00:46:36.525
you're having to come back to the gospel.

00:46:36.795 --> 00:46:39.795
But for somebody in this room, it
may be you, I don't know who it is,

00:46:39.855 --> 00:46:43.335
may be you, that you need to give
your lives to Jesus, that you need

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:47.145
to repent and believe, and that if
that is you today, how do you repent?

00:46:47.145 --> 00:46:47.925
Believe we're gonna do this.

00:46:47.925 --> 00:46:50.145
Eyes open, not heads closed.

00:46:50.145 --> 00:46:51.555
We're not gonna do it
with the perfect prayer.

00:46:51.705 --> 00:46:53.655
How do we give our lives to Jesus?

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:58.920
By saying, Jesus, I need you
by saying, I repented my sins.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.180
Lord, forgive me.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.210
Come into my life and change my life.

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:07.500
And if that's you today and you're sitting
there and you're thinking in your life

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.300
right now, I wanna give my life to Jesus.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:13.020
I want to repent, believe in Jesus,
and I wanna give my life to you.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.990
In that moment of belief,
God has saved you.

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:17.640
See, it's that simple.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.880
It's not about the perfect
prayer or the perfect life.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:23.220
It's really about.

00:47:23.654 --> 00:47:29.625
The perfect Jesus and our
willingness to say, yes, I surrender.

00:47:30.525 --> 00:47:34.095
So if that's you today and you prayed
that you believe that you've given

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:38.384
your life to Jesus, don't keep it
to yourself at the end of service.

00:47:38.384 --> 00:47:40.095
I would love for you to come
and talk to me and say, Hey,

00:47:40.515 --> 00:47:41.895
I've given my life to Jesus.

00:47:42.345 --> 00:47:43.154
What's next?

00:47:43.875 --> 00:47:47.685
Those of you that maybe have felt like
you've given your life to Jesus and you've

00:47:48.255 --> 00:47:51.555
moved into sin and brokenness and you're
trying to figure out how to recover,

00:47:51.884 --> 00:47:53.174
it's recovering through the gospel.

00:47:55.275 --> 00:47:56.505
And that's the answer for you.

00:47:56.505 --> 00:48:00.285
We still, as believers repent
when we've fallen away from the

00:48:00.285 --> 00:48:03.945
Lord and we begin to recover and
experience God's perfect peace again.

00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:05.715
So here's what's gonna happen.

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.575
I'm gonna pray for us one
more time and then we're gonna

00:48:07.575 --> 00:48:08.535
stand and we're gonna worship.

00:48:09.075 --> 00:48:10.455
And I'm gonna stay over here on the side.

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:11.325
Brittany's gonna be down here.

00:48:11.325 --> 00:48:15.045
Ladies, if you need her, if you
need prayer, please come find us.

00:48:15.045 --> 00:48:15.915
We wanna pray with you.

00:48:15.915 --> 00:48:17.145
We want to encourage you through this.

00:48:17.145 --> 00:48:19.035
So, Lord Jesus, thank you for who you are.

00:48:19.035 --> 00:48:20.205
Thank you for your word.

00:48:20.505 --> 00:48:22.845
Thank you for your example through Paul.

00:48:23.475 --> 00:48:25.245
Lord, thank you for your
example through Jesus.

00:48:25.245 --> 00:48:27.105
I mean, just all that he went through.

00:48:27.105 --> 00:48:32.055
Lord, thank you for that
because you have helped us.

00:48:33.165 --> 00:48:35.265
And Lord, I just pray that you
continue to help us find healing

00:48:36.105 --> 00:48:37.455
even in the midst of our brokenness.

00:48:37.935 --> 00:48:38.955
We just pray this into heaven again.
