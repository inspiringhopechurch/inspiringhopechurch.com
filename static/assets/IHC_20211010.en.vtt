You, you tend to cry like you
haven't cried in forever, cause

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.510
it probably has been forever.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.610
And so I'll just, I'll just
want to share just a little bit

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.840
one, thank you to everybody.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.740
That was a part of that.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.220
And I know if your spouses are
back in the back, I'll make sure

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.300
and try to tell them as well.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.240
I know some of you didn't even get
a chance to be on the video, but I

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.660
know how much you care for us and
how much you love and support us.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.020
Um, and just know this in
order for us to do what we do.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.040
And we wouldn't be who
we are without you guys.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.180
And I appreciate that.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.330
I mean, that's the thing that I think
about is we are who we are because of

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.890
the team that got us placed around us.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.250
And so thank you guys for
supporting us and loving us.

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:49.379
Um, and, uh, yeah, like it's, it's
those moments like today where it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.380
comes in reality that how hard it is,
um, And what we've done for two years.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.730
And I think at times you just
keep going, you know, you just put

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.750
your head down, you keep going.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.800
And today's a day to just reflect
and realize that God has placed some

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.710
amazing people around us and, um, an
amazing community that we love, uh,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.860
and we're excited to continue to,
to grow and, and things like that.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.760
So just super pumped and
thankful, um, for today.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.100
So I'm going to try to keep
it together as we jump into.

00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:21.825
Uh, the book of Jonah.

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:23.804
And so we're going to be
in Jonah chapter three.

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:29.804
Um, we have been walking through the
book of Jonah for several weeks now.

00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:33.524
Um, and we are hitting, uh, an
interesting, what I would say

00:01:33.524 --> 00:01:37.604
interesting part of Jonah heading
into the end of Jonah, but in Jonah

00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:40.574
chapter three, there's a couple of
things that we've been seeing recently.

00:01:40.574 --> 00:01:42.615
And last week we talked
about this and we're going to

00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:44.145
continue this theme, which is.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.060
When we, when we get into the
word of God, it's so important.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.310
And my wife reminds me
of this, of all the time.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.490
She says, honey, what
does the word say about.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.560
What does the word say about God?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.110
Because the first thing, and again,
you're going to hear application today.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.780
We're going to ask the question,
what does this mean to me?

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.289
Right.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.150
Like, how does this apply to me?

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.020
How do I apply to my life?

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.900
But it's so important to ask the
question, what does it say about God?

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.440
And so last week we started this,
really, this, this, what I would

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.480
call two weeks of this thought that
God is a God of second chances.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.650
And we actually sang a little bit about it
today is this idea that God, doesn't say

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.329
you get one chance to live the right life.

00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:23.565
Or it's over?

00:02:23.655 --> 00:02:27.345
No, he's consistently saying, Hey, you
know, I know you're going to mess up.

00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:28.304
And when you do.

00:02:29.565 --> 00:02:33.825
To give you grace when you recognize
your sin, repent and turn from it.

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:38.025
And so we see in this picture, we saw
this last week, um, there, there was

00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:39.645
three people that we talked about, right.

00:02:39.645 --> 00:02:42.075
That God gives a second
chance to in this text.

00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:44.955
And really it's the third one he
doesn't necessarily speak to, but

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:47.775
we recognize the first one was
he gave Jonah a second chance.

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.220
Um, he gave Jonah a second chance, which
means this rather than just killing

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.959
off Jonah and moving on from him.

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.010
He decides to bring trials and
storms into his life to bring

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.399
them to a point of repentance,
to use him for his will, right?

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:03.470
To go and share the gospel
to the people of Nineveh.

00:03:04.275 --> 00:03:07.905
He gave a second chance to the people
of Nineveh who were living a life that

00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:10.605
were, was not honoring to God at all.

00:03:11.085 --> 00:03:12.674
And he, God said, you know what?

00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:14.385
I'm not going to just destroy you.

00:03:14.385 --> 00:03:17.415
I'm going to send somebody to give
you an opportunity a second chance,

00:03:17.805 --> 00:03:21.345
but in that picture and the more
that you study, God's word, it's this

00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:23.685
picture that God ultimately gives us.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.150
Uh, second chance.

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.970
So we're going to extend that theme
a little bit, but we're going to

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.560
see today this transition, and I'm
going to read the whole text at home.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.519
I'm gonna read all of chapter
three, so we make sure we get

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.510
the whole context with this.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.690
If you weren't here last week,
but we're gonna see today

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.630
how a king, a leader model.

00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:45.735
What true repentance is and what
that means for us specifically.

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:47.145
But I wanna start off with this question.

00:03:47.145 --> 00:03:51.585
Has there any, oh, I want to ask
specifically how many of you have

00:03:51.585 --> 00:03:53.355
had a role model in your life?

00:03:53.355 --> 00:03:54.315
Someone you looked up to.

00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:55.815
Okay.

00:03:55.815 --> 00:03:59.385
I want at least two people to tell me
who that is and why you looked up to

00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:02.975
him to people who was your role model.

00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:03.905
Why'd you look up to him?

00:04:03.935 --> 00:04:04.715
What was important?

00:04:07.075 --> 00:04:07.495
Okay.

00:04:09.085 --> 00:04:09.415
That's good.

00:04:11.545 --> 00:04:12.114
That's great.

00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:12.744
Awesome.

00:04:13.015 --> 00:04:13.644
One more person.

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:16.704
Okay.

00:04:16.765 --> 00:04:17.005
Yeah.

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:28.275
That's awesome.

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:28.965
Yeah.

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:34.474
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.300
Thank you for sharing.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.560
Um, when we think you guys are thinking
of that person right now, right?

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.160
When we think about a person that we see
as a role model, let me give you mine.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.270
Mine is my grandpa.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.270
My Papa's what I would use to
call him my Papa passed away.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.040
Um, and I need to not be emotional
today after that, but, um, about

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.030
three years ago and he made a
significant impact in my life.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.590
I wouldn't be the person I am today.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.720
And I think about this the way
that my Papa loved his grandkids.

00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:08.365
Taught me how to love my kids,
but more importantly, what I

00:05:08.365 --> 00:05:10.525
want to be to my grandkids.

00:05:10.915 --> 00:05:13.315
See my Papa was one of my
role models in my life.

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:14.365
And was he perfect?

00:05:14.365 --> 00:05:16.525
No, and I think most of us
would say this our role models.

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:19.735
Aren't perfect, but there's somebody
in which we would say, Hey, we

00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:21.985
look to as an example in this area.

00:05:21.985 --> 00:05:25.555
And so let me just explain a
role model is a person looked on

00:05:25.555 --> 00:05:27.175
by others as an example to him.

00:05:28.585 --> 00:05:28.945
Right.

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:32.245
And so if I want to just get
straight to it, ultimately our

00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:34.405
greatest role model is Jesus himself.

00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:34.825
Right?

00:05:35.215 --> 00:05:38.755
And we're going to continue to say
that, look to Jesus as your role model.

00:05:39.174 --> 00:05:42.414
But today, when we jump into this
text, we're going to see how the king,

00:05:43.015 --> 00:05:46.405
the king of Nineveh was a role model
and what true bins look like right.

00:05:46.405 --> 00:05:49.495
To his people, to Jonah,
and ultimately to us.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.820
And so as we saw this last week,
right, this second chance that that

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.159
God gave Jonah, um, we continue to
see that again, in this text, we

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:02.789
realized that the, in response to
Jonah getting a second chance, what

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.440
did he do when he responded correctly?

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.140
So we looked at chapter one of Jonah.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.140
It says that Jonah says the
word of the Lord came to Jonah

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.300
and Jonah got up and ran.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.289
Last week, we talked about the word
of the Lord, came to Jonah a second

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:17.730
time and Jonah got up and went.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.410
So Jonah responded correctly
with his second chance.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.180
And I think about us right?

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.970
When God gives you a second,
third, fourth, or hundredth chance,

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.610
are we responding correctly?

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.000
Right?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.380
Are we responding correctly?

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.510
So God used Jonah's message right.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.100
To lead these people to repentance.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.100
Um, and we, we just learned this
idea and I think this is important

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.580
for us as we kind of jump into
this text when we fail or when we

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.100
make a big mistake and sin, right.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.800
When we sin against God, God is
ready and willing to forgive us.

00:06:48.505 --> 00:06:50.065
So you're never too broken.

00:06:50.095 --> 00:06:52.225
You're never too far
from God to be forgiven.

00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:55.885
And I'm telling you guys, if you're
anything like me, we beat ourselves up.

00:06:56.485 --> 00:06:57.355
We beat ourselves up.

00:06:57.355 --> 00:07:00.655
We, we look at ourselves as
though, you know, I'm just too bad.

00:07:00.655 --> 00:07:01.315
I've not done.

00:07:01.325 --> 00:07:02.545
I've I've done too much.

00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:04.285
And the Lord says no repentance.

00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:09.685
If you will truly understand your sin and
turn from it, he has graciously ready to

00:07:09.685 --> 00:07:11.515
forgive every single one of your songs.

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:16.104
So when we pick up in this
story, we'll see again, a little

00:07:16.104 --> 00:07:17.515
bit more of this, this idea.

00:07:17.515 --> 00:07:19.284
So let's read, so we can just jump in.

00:07:19.284 --> 00:07:24.715
Let's read this starting in verse one of
chapter, three of Jonah, and we'll see,

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:26.695
um, kind of how it all comes together.

00:07:26.695 --> 00:07:30.385
And it says the word of the Lord
came to Jonah a second time, get up,

00:07:30.414 --> 00:07:33.685
go to the great city of Indiana and
preach the message that I tell you.

00:07:34.015 --> 00:07:37.495
And so Jonah got up and went to Nineveh,
according to the Lord's command.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.680
Now Nineveh was an extremely great city.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.240
A three day walk Jonah set out
on the first day of his walk in

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.630
the city and proclaimed in 40
days, Nineveh will be demolished.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.320
Then the people of Nineveh believed
God, they proclaimed a fast and

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.080
dressed in sackcloth and from
the greatest of them to the.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.460
And when the word reached the king
of Nineveh, he got up from his

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.860
throne, took off of his Royal robe,
put on sackcloth and sat in ashes.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.280
And then he issued a decree in
Nineveh by order of the king and

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.700
his Nobles, no person or animal or
herd or flock is to taste anything.

00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:16.619
They must not eat or drink water.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.940
Furthermore, both people and animals
must be covered with sackcloth and

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.669
everyone must call out earnestly to God.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.710
Each one must turn from his evil
ways and from his wrongdoings, who

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.440
knows maybe God will turn and relent.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.860
He may turn from his burning
anger so that we will not pay.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:40.680
And so God saw their actions that
they had turned from their evil ways.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.980
And so God relented from the
disaster, he had threatened

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.920
with him and he did not do it.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.890
So let's pray before we
continue on Lord Jesus.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.920
We just pray that you open our
hearts and minds, Lord to this word.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.550
May you speak directly to each one
of us Lord, because you know, there's

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.010
a message and a word for each of us.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.480
We pray this in your heavenly name.

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.324
So here's what we know.

00:09:04.324 --> 00:09:05.555
And I think maybe you guys know this.

00:09:05.915 --> 00:09:09.125
If you've ever followed a leader,
the leader sets the example.

00:09:09.155 --> 00:09:11.074
If the leader models, it it's easier.

00:09:11.074 --> 00:09:14.314
When the leader tells
you, Hey, go do this.

00:09:14.584 --> 00:09:14.824
Right.

00:09:14.824 --> 00:09:15.185
It's not.

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:16.175
And I was thinking about this.

00:09:16.474 --> 00:09:18.155
I don't know if you've ever
heard your parents said this.

00:09:18.155 --> 00:09:19.954
Hey, do what I say, not what I do.

00:09:20.734 --> 00:09:22.295
And we would be like, that's not.

00:09:22.324 --> 00:09:22.805
Right.

00:09:22.864 --> 00:09:23.255
Right.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.724
So we see here, this leader,
this king setting an example.

00:09:27.724 --> 00:09:28.805
And so I want to address.

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:31.395
The thing that you'll say,
Hey, what about verse five?

00:09:31.395 --> 00:09:36.345
The people started repenting
before the leader led out in this.

00:09:36.645 --> 00:09:38.745
Well, we do want to find, I'm
not going to jump too far ahead

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:39.975
because we're going to cover it all.

00:09:40.275 --> 00:09:43.155
Is you see that he makes
a decree that everyone.

00:09:43.275 --> 00:09:48.165
So what he did was yes, people started
doing this without his example, but

00:09:48.165 --> 00:09:52.785
once he set the example and then made
the decree, everyone followed suit.

00:09:52.785 --> 00:09:54.135
And how do we know if
everyone followed suit?

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:57.015
Because the Lord saw
their actions and really.

00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:00.195
And so the leader in
this, this is important.

00:10:00.195 --> 00:10:03.255
So we're gonna start with this as
the king sets the example, right?

00:10:03.255 --> 00:10:05.775
And so it says the word
reached the king, right?

00:10:05.775 --> 00:10:06.885
The word, the message.

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.955
And we look back at this message
and I want to kind of affirm.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:15.720
This message is so short it's in 40
days, Nineveh will be demolished.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.240
And we talked about this a little bit
on our Wednesday night inspire group.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.360
If you're not a part of an inspire
group, you should be on Wednesday nights.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.030
We have two inspire groups,
one that meets here at six 30

00:10:24.569 --> 00:10:25.590
and one that meets a middle to.

00:10:26.074 --> 00:10:26.824
At six 30.

00:10:26.824 --> 00:10:29.915
So if you're interested in being a part of
inspire group, which is basically a small

00:10:29.915 --> 00:10:33.574
group, we take the texts that we preach on
Sundays, and we just go through it deeper.

00:10:33.935 --> 00:10:35.225
We apply it to our lives.

00:10:35.285 --> 00:10:36.694
So I'd encourage you to be a part of that.

00:10:37.175 --> 00:10:39.814
But what we talked about on
Wednesday was this idea of many

00:10:39.814 --> 00:10:41.915
times we criticize Nineveh or not.

00:10:41.915 --> 00:10:45.275
None of us, excuse me, Jonah, for
the short message, it was horrible.

00:10:45.335 --> 00:10:49.625
He could have given more clarity, but
what we see here is it says that he

00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:53.135
preached the word that the Lord gave him.

00:10:53.805 --> 00:10:55.725
So maybe that was the word
that the Lord gave him.

00:10:55.995 --> 00:10:59.145
So in that short message
that the king heard, right.

00:10:59.805 --> 00:11:02.535
He responded to, he responded to it.

00:11:03.135 --> 00:11:06.075
And so it's interesting
when we think about this.

00:11:06.075 --> 00:11:08.205
So we're going to kind of walk through
what, what happened to the king.

00:11:08.205 --> 00:11:11.625
It says when the word reached the
king of Nineveh, he got up from

00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:13.425
his throne and took off his role.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.380
So he gave up everything.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.090
He felt like he was entitled to.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.780
So think about a king, a king, as
someone who sits on a throne, which

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:28.330
shows his position and his authority,
his robe shows his royalty, right.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.030
And his understanding of
everything, he, him, his has a mass.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.090
He gave it all up in humility.

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:41.170
He gave it all up in humility to say, Hey,
I recognize that whatever I have in my

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.510
possession means nothing to me in this.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.400
I'm recognizing those
things are worthless to me.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.590
And so I started thinking
about what is humility?

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:50.400
What is humility?

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.069
It's the modest or low view
of one's own importance.

00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:56.430
And so I've said this several times
before and other messages, but

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.380
it's not thinking less of yourself.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:11:59.819
It's thinking about yourself less.

00:12:00.584 --> 00:12:01.995
It's not about you anymore.

00:12:02.025 --> 00:12:05.564
And this moment for the king, it
wasn't about his position or all that

00:12:05.564 --> 00:12:07.545
he had and all these 120,000 people.

00:12:07.545 --> 00:12:09.855
And so by I can correct myself on this.

00:12:10.094 --> 00:12:12.464
I kept saying 600,000
last couple of weeks.

00:12:12.645 --> 00:12:13.755
I'm not sure where I got that number.

00:12:13.755 --> 00:12:15.045
It's really about 120,000.

00:12:15.045 --> 00:12:16.574
And it actually says
that later on in Jonah.

00:12:16.574 --> 00:12:18.495
So see pastors make mistakes too.

00:12:18.495 --> 00:12:19.064
It's okay.

00:12:20.805 --> 00:12:23.834
But he had the ability to sit
there and say, no, I'm a king.

00:12:23.834 --> 00:12:24.735
I have a high position.

00:12:24.735 --> 00:12:25.694
I have high authority.

00:12:25.694 --> 00:12:27.074
I don't have to listen to God.

00:12:27.285 --> 00:12:28.635
I'm just going to tell God to shove it.

00:12:28.635 --> 00:12:28.935
He did.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.360
He took off the things, which would
recognize him as important and higher.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.860
And he made himself low.

00:12:35.579 --> 00:12:36.780
He made himself low.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.430
So I've got a question.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.689
Any of you ever felt entitled
to have something to thank some

00:12:42.689 --> 00:12:44.490
way anybody ever felt entitled?

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:45.510
Maybe you don't wanna admit it.

00:12:46.439 --> 00:12:49.350
That's CSR asking questions sometimes
that nobody wants to raise their

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.140
hand on, but inside they know,
Hey there's times I felt in titled

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:54.449
there's times where I felt justified.

00:12:55.079 --> 00:12:56.010
I don't know what it is.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:56.790
You know what it is.

00:12:57.945 --> 00:12:59.835
But I wouldn't want you to look at this.

00:12:59.835 --> 00:13:00.855
King is setting an example.

00:13:00.855 --> 00:13:04.275
There's some things in our lives
that we may think we're entitled

00:13:04.275 --> 00:13:06.645
to, but are not beneficial.

00:13:06.645 --> 00:13:11.025
And our calling that God has for us,
they get in the way of the position

00:13:11.025 --> 00:13:12.585
that God is calling us to be.

00:13:12.615 --> 00:13:16.575
The king could have allowed his
authority, his position, his throne,

00:13:16.575 --> 00:13:17.925
to get in the way of his repentance.

00:13:18.135 --> 00:13:20.025
And he didn't, he didn't.

00:13:20.475 --> 00:13:22.275
So let me, let me mention
just a few things, right?

00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:24.945
So it could be a relationship
that you think you're entitled.

00:13:25.935 --> 00:13:27.795
But God's saying, Hey, that's
not beneficial for you.

00:13:27.795 --> 00:13:29.745
And the call that I have to
you, it could be luxuries.

00:13:29.745 --> 00:13:30.885
It could be desires.

00:13:31.095 --> 00:13:33.765
It could be just like this
king of position, right.

00:13:33.795 --> 00:13:35.805
These things hinder our walks.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:38.235
And so this is what the word says.

00:13:38.235 --> 00:13:40.935
I'm going to give you a couple of verses
to kind of affirm this Hebrews 12.

00:13:40.935 --> 00:13:45.225
One says this, therefore, since we
all have such a large cloud of large

00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:49.005
cloud of witnesses surrounding us,
let us lay aside every hindrance.

00:13:49.844 --> 00:13:53.775
And sin that so easily ensnares
us and let us run with endurance,

00:13:53.775 --> 00:13:55.035
the race that lies before us.

00:13:55.425 --> 00:13:59.354
So the scripture is telling us there are
things which we feel entitled to that are

00:13:59.354 --> 00:14:04.334
withholding us from experiencing the full
blessing of God, the full call of God.

00:14:04.785 --> 00:14:08.625
And for many of us just like this
king, it's the sin in our lives.

00:14:09.045 --> 00:14:11.084
It's the things that just
aren't beneficial for us.

00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:14.865
Maybe that are distracting
us from what God has for us.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.780
I guess I just, I think
about this story so much.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.190
God could have used anybody to reach
Nineveh, anybody to reach Nineveh.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:28.020
He chose to use Jonah and Jonah said no,
but God said, no, I'm stubborn enough.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:28.950
I'm going to use you.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:29.700
Why?

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.960
Because God valued Jonah,
an individual, one person.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.790
When he cause he used
anybody in the world.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:36.780
Think about that with.

00:14:38.225 --> 00:14:41.105
Maybe you're sitting there
going, God can use somebody else.

00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:43.055
You know, I'm just, I'm an entitled.

00:14:43.055 --> 00:14:44.225
This I'm a Christian.

00:14:44.314 --> 00:14:45.035
And let me just do that.

00:14:45.185 --> 00:14:46.295
I'm a Christian, I'm a believer.

00:14:46.415 --> 00:14:49.025
I don't deny that, but I'm not
going to give God that this area

00:14:49.025 --> 00:14:51.155
of my life, I'm not going to
let God have I'm entitled to it.

00:14:51.155 --> 00:14:51.965
Somebody else would do it.

00:14:52.355 --> 00:14:55.025
And God's like, no, you, I want you.

00:14:55.385 --> 00:14:56.855
I want 100% of you.

00:14:57.064 --> 00:14:58.055
I want all of you.

00:14:58.295 --> 00:14:59.735
I want that area of your life.

00:15:00.365 --> 00:15:04.535
That is hindering you from the
call that he has on your life.

00:15:04.745 --> 00:15:05.255
Maybe it's your.

00:15:07.104 --> 00:15:09.805
I don't know what it is, cause
I'm not here to have you admit

00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:11.125
it to me and me cover it for you.

00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:11.875
Cause that's not me.

00:15:12.025 --> 00:15:16.944
I'm here to communicate God's word and God
covers the sin in our life that we begin

00:15:16.944 --> 00:15:19.584
to address and recognize as hindrance.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.890
Let's look at first
Corinthians 10 23 through 24.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:24.360
It says this, everything.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.170
This is Paul speaking.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.800
Everything is permissible, but
not everything is beneficial.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:33.150
Everything is permissible
and not everything builds up.

00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:36.300
No one is to seek his own good,
but the good of the other.

00:15:37.765 --> 00:15:38.845
So what's the point here?

00:15:38.845 --> 00:15:39.835
What are we trying to make here?

00:15:40.195 --> 00:15:44.515
Is this king took up everything that
he felt that he was entitled to have in

00:15:44.515 --> 00:15:48.655
his position in order to humble himself
and recognize his need for repentance.

00:15:48.835 --> 00:15:50.875
He did not let anything hold him back.

00:15:51.265 --> 00:15:52.645
He did not let anything hold him back.

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:56.515
Cause there's times I'm just going
to be right out there with you.

00:15:56.575 --> 00:16:01.615
There's times there's days where I know
the Lord is telling me this isn't value

00:16:01.625 --> 00:16:03.935
before you and I do what Jonah did.

00:16:03.935 --> 00:16:06.415
And chapter one, I turned
the other way and I.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:08.565
Now it is valuable for me.

00:16:08.625 --> 00:16:09.615
And you know, what the Lord does.

00:16:10.005 --> 00:16:11.385
He brings about conviction.

00:16:11.415 --> 00:16:13.185
See a relationship with Jesus.

00:16:13.335 --> 00:16:16.665
If you want to know you have one
conviction is present in your life.

00:16:17.065 --> 00:16:21.705
Conviction is this inner being that
says, Hey, this is not good for you,

00:16:22.125 --> 00:16:26.505
but let me just tell you this, the
further you get away from a personal

00:16:26.505 --> 00:16:31.455
relationship with Jesus, the more
that becomes lighter and lighter.

00:16:31.845 --> 00:16:33.345
Where, what does the Lord say?

00:16:33.345 --> 00:16:35.835
It says it in Romans that
he gave them over to them.

00:16:37.165 --> 00:16:40.915
What's this means is, Hey, your
consequences are going to come up from,

00:16:40.945 --> 00:16:42.085
and that's what he did to Jonah here.

00:16:42.385 --> 00:16:46.495
His consequences of, of the being
thrown off the ship and obviously eaten

00:16:46.495 --> 00:16:48.055
by the big fish, which was not fun.

00:16:48.055 --> 00:16:48.355
Right.

00:16:48.505 --> 00:16:51.835
He allowed those to draw
them, him to repentance.

00:16:52.105 --> 00:16:52.345
So.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.199
That's where we want to see this as that.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.050
A lot of times it's our pride
that gets in the way, right.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:58.949
We feel entitled.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.709
We spend so much time
justifying ourselves before God.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.129
And all he wants us to do is
humble ourselves and admit our

00:17:05.129 --> 00:17:07.530
sins and recognize our need for.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.640
So, this is the important part.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.069
He does not just take
off something, right?

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.530
His, he doesn't step down from
his throne and take off his ropes.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.670
He puts on a couple of things.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.390
So what does he put on?

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:22.490
We see here, it says that he, um, he
put on sackcloth and he sat in ashes.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.740
And I don't know about you
guys, but that's not probably a

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.599
good style to wear these days.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.310
You might stick out.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:35.280
And so, you know, for a king to
do this shows complete and utter humility.

00:17:36.314 --> 00:17:36.975
To put on sackcloth.

00:17:36.975 --> 00:17:38.985
So what sackcloth, why
did they put on sackcloth?

00:17:38.985 --> 00:17:44.655
So sack cloth is a coarsely woven fabric,
usually made of goat's hair and ashes.

00:17:44.655 --> 00:17:45.855
That's simple enough, right?

00:17:45.885 --> 00:17:46.804
Fire ashes.

00:17:46.834 --> 00:17:47.685
He puts it on his head.

00:17:48.044 --> 00:17:49.365
So I want to ask you guys this question.

00:17:49.365 --> 00:17:52.064
Why did, and if you know
this, this is great.

00:17:52.064 --> 00:17:52.995
I want us all to talk about it.

00:17:53.504 --> 00:17:56.084
Why would the king put
on sackcloth and ashes?

00:17:56.084 --> 00:17:58.445
What is this a sign of?

00:17:59.045 --> 00:18:00.014
Remorse.

00:18:00.014 --> 00:18:00.465
Humility.

00:18:00.495 --> 00:18:01.965
What else is there anything
else you can think of?

00:18:03.824 --> 00:18:05.845
Those are right by the way.

00:18:10.225 --> 00:18:10.975
Repentance.

00:18:11.095 --> 00:18:12.655
Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:14.095 --> 00:18:18.045
So when we think about those things,
right, we look at this, this way is it's,

00:18:18.235 --> 00:18:21.865
this is a display in the flesh, what was
happening in their heart or their soul.

00:18:22.585 --> 00:18:26.245
It was a display outwardly
of what inwardly

00:18:26.245 --> 00:18:29.965
they were recognizing. That they were
broken, that they were in shambles.

00:18:30.975 --> 00:18:32.024
That they were dirty.

00:18:32.024 --> 00:18:33.375
When we talk about sin
lotta times, we're dirty.

00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:36.945
We're, we know that we're in the
wrong. They were recognizing that

00:18:36.975 --> 00:18:39.405
outwardly what was happening inwardly.

00:18:39.764 --> 00:18:43.455
And here's what I know when, when,
when, when you have that there, people

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:47.085
ask questions and you begin to say,
Hey, you know, I'm just being honest.

00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:47.865
And here, here's what we know.

00:18:47.865 --> 00:18:49.065
Guys is essential.

00:18:50.084 --> 00:18:53.235
That is confessed to God
is, is 100% forgiven.

00:18:53.745 --> 00:18:56.865
But at times with our sin, in
order to overcome it, we need

00:18:56.865 --> 00:18:57.915
to confess it to a friend.

00:18:58.365 --> 00:19:02.264
We need to confess it to somebody who
can walk with us to hold us accountable.

00:19:02.854 --> 00:19:05.235
And just so you know, it's not
like I'm saying, Hey, at the end of

00:19:05.235 --> 00:19:07.784
service today, everybody's going to
stand up on the line, get a mic and

00:19:07.784 --> 00:19:09.074
confess your sins to each other.

00:19:09.465 --> 00:19:10.935
You know, if you want to do that great.

00:19:11.264 --> 00:19:14.745
But I, and I'm, I'm, I'm encouraging
you to say, Hey, we can't let our

00:19:14.745 --> 00:19:16.844
sin be something that is hidden.

00:19:16.875 --> 00:19:18.104
It needs to be something that is

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.470
publicly or not publicly, but it
needs to be out of just, not just

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.560
you, but with someone else that can
say, Hey, they're not sitting there

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.140
judging you, but they're sitting there
saying, Hey, can I walk with you?

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.190
Can I hold you accountable?

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.440
Can I help you in this?

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.760
Guys, that's when we begin to overcome it.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.630
Um, and this is what we see with
this outward display, right?

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.900
So it's a picture of someone
who's truly broken over their sin.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:41.670
And so the king, and this is important.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.580
The king didn't just want to say
a prayer under his breath and say,

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.310
Lord, forgive us for all of our
sins, but he wanted to make it public.

00:19:48.389 --> 00:19:50.189
And he knew that the way
he was living was not.

00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:50.610
Right.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.179
Right.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.389
And so some of us need to follow
through with maybe what that is.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:54.990
Yeah.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:55.379
Go ahead.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:59.750
Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:07.030
Yeah.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.350
It's a great picture.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.129
Yeah.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.810
Right.

00:20:14.715 --> 00:20:17.835
Yeah, but see, this is this,
that's a great picture, right?

00:20:17.835 --> 00:20:21.975
We have one king Pharaoh
hardened heart, right.

00:20:22.035 --> 00:20:24.885
And we can get into that another day,
but hardened heart, he didn't do this.

00:20:24.885 --> 00:20:25.845
He wasn't humble.

00:20:26.205 --> 00:20:28.965
And at times he faked it, but
really he never was humble.

00:20:29.265 --> 00:20:31.665
And we see another king that could
have done just what Pharaoh did, but he

00:20:31.665 --> 00:20:37.215
didn't. Why? I would say this, God desires

00:20:37.215 --> 00:20:37.995
this is what it says in his word,

00:20:38.025 --> 00:20:38.715
God desires

00:20:38.715 --> 00:20:42.525
that everyone be saved and come
to a relationship with Him.

00:20:42.555 --> 00:20:43.125
Everyone.

00:20:44.415 --> 00:20:45.284
But he won't force you.

00:20:45.645 --> 00:20:46.274
That's our part.

00:20:46.514 --> 00:20:49.274
We have to choose to recognize
our sin, just like this king did

00:20:49.575 --> 00:20:50.985
and lay it all out there.

00:20:50.985 --> 00:20:55.695
Be open and honest and say, I
surrender. Lord, use me. Allow me

00:20:55.695 --> 00:20:56.865
to be forgiven and that was the thing.

00:20:56.865 --> 00:20:58.455
He did this and we're not
even getting there yet.

00:20:58.455 --> 00:21:00.764
He did this before he even
knew God would forgive him.

00:21:01.125 --> 00:21:03.195
I mean, if you, if you didn't know,
God was going to forgive you for

00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:05.655
some of you may say I'm going
to live it up for the next X

00:21:05.655 --> 00:21:07.935
amount of days until he destroys us.

00:21:08.205 --> 00:21:08.504
But he didn't.

00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:10.365
And it's interesting.

00:21:10.965 --> 00:21:13.875
And so here's something I just want
to mention when I think offhand as

00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:17.655
well as some of us, when we think
about our faith in Jesus, we talk

00:21:17.655 --> 00:21:19.274
about being public with our sin.

00:21:19.455 --> 00:21:20.985
Basically confessing it to someone.

00:21:21.345 --> 00:21:24.885
I would say this another way to
publicly confess your faith in

00:21:24.885 --> 00:21:28.065
Jesus, that some of us may have
not taken the next step in is baptism.

00:21:29.125 --> 00:21:31.105
And I just want to mention that
because I think sometimes we

00:21:31.105 --> 00:21:32.635
miss the importance of baptism.

00:21:32.635 --> 00:21:34.735
It's not a security of
salvation with baptism,

00:21:34.855 --> 00:21:38.965
but it is a public profession
of Jesus that if you're refusing to

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:42.715
be baptized after giving your life to
Jesus, it's saying there's something

00:21:42.715 --> 00:21:44.185
in you that wants to hide that.

00:21:44.605 --> 00:21:47.725
And so that's just encouragement to you
to say, Hey, maybe that's your next step.

00:21:47.725 --> 00:21:51.415
Maybe it's just publicly declaring through
baptism your relationship with Jesus.

00:21:51.415 --> 00:21:53.275
Maybe that's what's
hindering you in your walk.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.560
Um, and I think that this, this
kind of points to that is saying,

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.640
Hey, that could be an area.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.720
So not only does the king set the
example, here's what the king does.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.950
He makes a decree.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.220
And so let's go back to this idea that
the leader sets, sets the standard.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.320
And again, this is the
ways I think of scripture.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.710
And so, you know, and I try to teach
you guys this, I opened the word

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.084
and I began to explore the word
and say, okay, Um, and I'm learning

00:22:15.084 --> 00:22:16.345
this more and more me and Brock we.

00:22:16.425 --> 00:22:18.925
We just recently went to a preaching
conference to learn a little bit

00:22:18.925 --> 00:22:20.185
more on how to study the word.

00:22:20.574 --> 00:22:25.044
And it's this idea of who is, is the text
talking about? What's the key theme, right?

00:22:25.044 --> 00:22:26.185
Where, where are they?

00:22:26.185 --> 00:22:26.814
Things like that.

00:22:26.814 --> 00:22:27.054
Right.

00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:30.145
And so whenever I study the Bible, I think
more and more like what's going on here.

00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:32.754
And this is what stuck out to
me is this king who set this

00:22:32.754 --> 00:22:35.605
example. And so, great leaders.

00:22:36.685 --> 00:22:36.985
Yes.

00:22:36.985 --> 00:22:40.105
They set the example, but I
think it's so important that

00:22:40.105 --> 00:22:41.905
they don't only model the change,

00:22:42.929 --> 00:22:46.110
by coming down from his throne, taking off
his robes and putting on the sackcloth

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:50.760
and ashes, but they challenge people
that they are over to do the same thing.

00:22:51.389 --> 00:22:55.709
Guys, leaders every day can live
the model life and though affect few.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:01.530
But leaders who not only model it, but
challenge people that they serve with

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.760
to live the life that God's called
them will affect  thousands and

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.260
thousands and thousands of people.

00:23:08.024 --> 00:23:08.294
Right.

00:23:08.294 --> 00:23:10.845
So we see this king set the standard.

00:23:10.845 --> 00:23:12.615
So I'm going to, I'm going to
jump a little bit ahead because

00:23:12.615 --> 00:23:13.665
I want you to think about this.

00:23:13.965 --> 00:23:15.375
You may be saying, but I'm not a leader.

00:23:16.245 --> 00:23:17.325
100%.

00:23:17.325 --> 00:23:19.575
You are. 100%.

00:23:19.575 --> 00:23:25.064
You are. God has called you
to be his child and disciple

00:23:25.064 --> 00:23:26.205
and a light to the world.

00:23:26.205 --> 00:23:29.685
And I don't know about you, but that
is a definition of a leader. It's someone

00:23:29.685 --> 00:23:32.804
who represents Christ to the world.

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:35.325
So if you want to kind of scoot out of
this and say, Hey, I'm not a leader.

00:23:35.325 --> 00:23:36.075
I don't have to listen to this. You are.

00:23:37.455 --> 00:23:39.705
So guys, start with you.

00:23:41.145 --> 00:23:42.675
And then now we're getting
ready to see how the king

00:23:42.675 --> 00:23:44.925
begins to now encourage, right?

00:23:44.925 --> 00:23:47.595
So the king could have recognized the
sin, repented of it, and it would have

00:23:47.595 --> 00:23:51.465
changed his life, but he decided to
make it a standard in Nineveh, right.

00:23:51.465 --> 00:23:52.455
He sets this decree.

00:23:52.455 --> 00:23:53.535
We know about decrees.

00:23:54.255 --> 00:23:56.415
You either do them or you're
probably going to get killed.

00:23:56.955 --> 00:23:57.975
I mean, that's really what it was.

00:23:57.975 --> 00:23:58.845
He was like, we're going to do this.

00:23:58.845 --> 00:24:01.005
And so we understand again, great leaders.

00:24:01.035 --> 00:24:02.355
Don't just live a model life.

00:24:02.385 --> 00:24:04.455
They challenge those around
them to live it as well.

00:24:04.635 --> 00:24:06.945
And I'm going to claim that quote,
cause I didn't find any where I wrote

00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:08.775
it down so you can hashtag me later.

00:24:09.315 --> 00:24:12.015
Um, but here's what I would
encourage you with this.

00:24:12.135 --> 00:24:15.795
I started thinking through this,
I could spend my weeks up here.

00:24:16.675 --> 00:24:19.584
Only talking about the way
in which I live my faith out.

00:24:19.675 --> 00:24:23.034
And so as a church, just so you know
this, we are a church that exists

00:24:23.365 --> 00:24:27.925
to inspire hope, by helping people,
by helping you, discover your purpose

00:24:28.165 --> 00:24:29.605
through relationship with Jesus.

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:32.754
I could sit here and talk
about how I do that every week.

00:24:33.645 --> 00:24:36.975
But I don't know about those around
here that are consistently here.

00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:41.365
I'm consistently, I feel like
challenging you here, challenging

00:24:41.385 --> 00:24:45.015
new and group and challenging you
in individual conversations to help

00:24:45.045 --> 00:24:48.645
other people discover their purpose
through relationship with Jesus.

00:24:49.425 --> 00:24:50.295
I'm reminded as a leader.

00:24:50.295 --> 00:24:53.835
I can't just sit up here and talk
about my stories and about what I do.

00:24:54.315 --> 00:24:57.915
I can model that and that's important,
but I need to make sure that I am

00:24:57.915 --> 00:24:59.955
challenging you and I am helping you.

00:25:00.915 --> 00:25:05.355
I'm walking with you and then encouraging
you to walk with other people.

00:25:05.355 --> 00:25:07.715
And one of the coolest things that
I would say in my wife's in here

00:25:07.735 --> 00:25:12.870
now, so I can say this, um, Couple
months ago, she just felt of the Lord

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:16.620
that she needs to lead a D group of
women, a discipleship group of women.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.690
And she's never done this.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.360
She's taught Bible studies and she's
never done it. But she just, she had

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.960
a conviction and you know what she
realized in her life, that was what

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.370
was holding her back from obedience.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.360
And she had conviction.

00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:32.100
So until she committed to inviting some
women in to this deeper discipleship,

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.440
she knew that she was not in the right

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.750
relationship that she
needed to be with the Lord.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.810
And she stepped out in faith
and she's figuring this out.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:40.800
And so what is she doing?

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.590
She's not only modeling it,
but she's teaching these

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.740
ladies to now do that again.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.490
That's what this king is reminding me of.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:51.000
This is.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.130
And just so you know, go to Jesus's life.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:53.940
He does the same thing.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.110
Where does she's in this story?

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.320
So I don't want to discount Jesus
is ultimately our model, right?

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.780
So let's, let's keep jumping into this.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:05.175
Um, I, I think it's so important
when we look at this, right?

00:26:05.175 --> 00:26:06.915
His first decree is to fast.

00:26:06.915 --> 00:26:08.265
And so we'll look at this just briefly.

00:26:08.265 --> 00:26:10.845
It says by order of the king
and his Nobles, no person or

00:26:10.845 --> 00:26:12.525
animal, and this is crazy.

00:26:12.525 --> 00:26:13.605
I still don't know the details of this.

00:26:13.635 --> 00:26:15.075
Why would you not have animals?

00:26:15.285 --> 00:26:19.005
But I would say this, he wanted
to cover every base, every base.

00:26:19.035 --> 00:26:21.855
I mean, he's saying I'm not going
to leave any stone unturned.

00:26:21.855 --> 00:26:23.745
And I think that's interesting
with this king, right?

00:26:24.015 --> 00:26:27.825
So he says no person or animal or
herd or flock should taste anything at all.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.230
They must not eat, drink,
or eat or drink water.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.620
Right?

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.040
So this first decree is to proclaim
a fast and what is a fast, right?

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.010
So he's talked about it right to
it's an eat food or water, but a

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:39.540
fasting could be something different.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.280
So I want to kind of give
a broad version of it.

00:26:41.639 --> 00:26:47.879
Fasting is to give up a need or a
desire of the flesh for a greater need

00:26:47.879 --> 00:26:49.800
for the soul or spirit, or the spirit.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.610
Someone mentioned this again to
fast is to give up a need or desire

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.980
of the flesh for a greater need.

00:26:56.655 --> 00:26:57.945
For the soul or the spirit.

00:26:58.545 --> 00:27:00.615
So I I'll just give you a great example.

00:27:00.615 --> 00:27:04.784
Whenever I was new in my faith and
I had actually came on staff as just

00:27:04.784 --> 00:27:06.495
an executive assistant to my pastor.

00:27:07.034 --> 00:27:11.685
Um, he was said, Hey, I'm going to fast
for the first 30 days of this new year.

00:27:12.315 --> 00:27:13.514
And I said, why are you fasting?

00:27:13.514 --> 00:27:14.205
I was kind of laughing.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.890
And I was like, where's that talk
about that in the word I'm still as

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.180
new my faith, he kind of laughed.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.100
He sent me a text message.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:25.260
That was a mile long of all the times in
the word where it talked about fasting

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.380
and that we should fast consistently
and why we should fast and how they

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.970
fasted and all these different things.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.370
And I'm like, oh my gosh,
fasting is important.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.500
Why is fasting important?

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.110
And so we're going to see
why fasting is important.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:42.210
Think about this when
we fast, it causes us

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.210
that every single time, the
water we're fasting for him.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.080
So take food.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:51.810
I think a food 24 7 all the time, every
time I think about food, I'm thinking

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:53.460
about the reason why I'm fasting.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.330
And I'm asking for the Lord
to give me help to be able to

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.120
sustain this fast, to be able to
think on that topic or whatever.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.350
So let's think about these people.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.680
Most people where some of the
old Testament times they spent

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.610
the majority of their day.

00:28:06.615 --> 00:28:08.385
Working for food and water, right.

00:28:08.505 --> 00:28:09.345
Working for food and water.

00:28:09.345 --> 00:28:12.405
They were just trying to get
something so that they could survive.

00:28:13.035 --> 00:28:13.665
At the moment.

00:28:13.665 --> 00:28:14.625
They couldn't have food and water.

00:28:14.625 --> 00:28:15.675
There was no need to work.

00:28:16.245 --> 00:28:20.205
They had more time to consider and
reflect on the sin in their heart.

00:28:20.805 --> 00:28:22.725
And every single time they thought
about, man, I need to be getting water.

00:28:22.725 --> 00:28:23.445
No, I don't need it.

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:24.135
Why do I need it?

00:28:24.135 --> 00:28:30.345
Because of my sin and I needed, it gave
them time away from their day to day.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.200
And this fasting and praying
and seeking the Lord.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.830
Wow.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.379
Like that's why he made this first decree.

00:28:37.379 --> 00:28:38.550
It's so important, right?

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:42.480
We, we get distracted, you know
this, but I think it's so important.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.800
What the purpose of Fasten is.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:48.480
And David and his prayer in Psalm
1 39, 23 through 24, says this,

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:54.929
search me God, and know my heart,
test me and know my concerns.

00:28:55.169 --> 00:28:59.340
See if there's any offensive way
in me and lead me in everlasting.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:04.020
So whenever I think about the purpose
of a fast it's time to reflect, it's

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.620
time to spend, I spend time with
the Lord to search our hearts and

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.600
whatever God reveals we turn from.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:15.120
See, that's why the king was asking
for them to fast was for them to

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.860
really consider what God was saying.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.250
Hey, in these days, you're
going to be perishing.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.390
If you don't respond.

00:29:22.395 --> 00:29:23.265
And he was desperate.

00:29:23.265 --> 00:29:25.575
So his second decree was to
put on the sackcloth, right?

00:29:25.575 --> 00:29:28.935
So again, we see that this is
display of, of, in the flesh of

00:29:28.935 --> 00:29:30.765
what is happening on the inside.

00:29:30.975 --> 00:29:34.395
So a sign of mourning and repentance,
but then he makes this third decree.

00:29:34.905 --> 00:29:36.795
And I want you guys to read this with me.

00:29:37.695 --> 00:29:41.745
He says, it's in the bottom
of first aid, verse eight.

00:29:41.745 --> 00:29:44.925
It says, furthermore, both people and
animals must be covered with sackcloth and

00:29:44.985 --> 00:29:47.745
everyone must call out earnestly to God.

00:29:47.745 --> 00:29:50.055
Somebody tell me what they
believe the word earnestly.

00:29:51.685 --> 00:29:55.024
Means, sincerely.

00:29:56.075 --> 00:29:56.435
Yup.

00:29:56.465 --> 00:29:57.514
That's exactly what it means.

00:29:57.514 --> 00:30:01.685
Sincerely or seriously with
sincere intense conviction.

00:30:02.195 --> 00:30:04.175
Here's why I think it's important.

00:30:04.175 --> 00:30:05.075
He uses this word.

00:30:05.075 --> 00:30:07.955
And so if you weren't here, I'm going
to try to summarize this in like three

00:30:07.955 --> 00:30:09.395
minutes, because I don't want to go long.

00:30:10.425 --> 00:30:13.005
But we talked about whenever Jonah
was in the belly of the fish,

00:30:13.965 --> 00:30:16.305
that his prayer was very selfish.

00:30:16.305 --> 00:30:18.675
And if you haven't read it this way,
I want you to go back and read it.

00:30:18.795 --> 00:30:22.725
There's a lot of eyes and there's not
very many, Hey Lord, forgive me for

00:30:22.725 --> 00:30:25.665
not helping the sellers, you know,
sailors, because I don't say that.

00:30:25.665 --> 00:30:25.875
Right.

00:30:25.905 --> 00:30:29.085
The sailors, um, come to Jesus Lord.

00:30:29.085 --> 00:30:32.505
I'm not worried about the Ninevites
that I'm not going to reach.

00:30:32.625 --> 00:30:35.235
I'm only worried about myself and
my condition and all the things.

00:30:36.044 --> 00:30:40.754
So I saw his prayer of repentance
is like a half-hearted repentance.

00:30:40.754 --> 00:30:44.925
And again, God accepted it, but
I think the king is modeling

00:30:44.925 --> 00:30:46.304
what true repentance is.

00:30:46.425 --> 00:30:52.094
Sincerity sincerity of the understanding
that for us is if we don't repent,

00:30:52.094 --> 00:30:57.435
it's not just trying to get out of
punishment is to really experience.

00:30:58.929 --> 00:31:03.250
God's grace and mercy, and really call
our lives that we actually understand

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:07.149
why we sinned, not just that we were
going to get punished for our sin.

00:31:07.449 --> 00:31:07.840
Right.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:12.520
So whenever they sincerely and I'll go on
here a little bit more, so says earnestly

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.260
to the God and each must turn from his
evil ways and from his wrong doing.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.080
So he was very specific in this.

00:31:21.254 --> 00:31:23.925
He wanted to make sure that they
understood the true elements

00:31:24.075 --> 00:31:25.425
of what it means to repent.

00:31:26.024 --> 00:31:28.815
So he says, basically searching
your heart to call out to God

00:31:28.815 --> 00:31:30.284
and turning from your evil ways.

00:31:31.335 --> 00:31:35.175
And again, I think he's using this, I
believe in when I say the King's using

00:31:35.175 --> 00:31:39.105
this, really the writer of Jonah is
using this as saying, Hey, let me give

00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:40.935
you a clear picture of what it is for.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:47.189
To truly repent of your sin and recognize
your need for God's grace and mercy.

00:31:47.189 --> 00:31:52.770
And that it is insincerity, not just
trying to repent and move on with life.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.100
And so I think it's easy for us.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.939
And those of you who maybe have been
saved a little bit longer to become

00:31:59.939 --> 00:32:01.409
numb to what true repentance is.

00:32:01.409 --> 00:32:02.879
And so why do I say that?

00:32:02.879 --> 00:32:07.649
Probably because I have at times say,
I don't think we realized that when

00:32:07.649 --> 00:32:09.090
we sin against God, we are really.

00:32:10.645 --> 00:32:14.365
Like in this idea is it's
not God's best for you.

00:32:14.365 --> 00:32:18.025
So when you send God's looking and saying,
you miss the opportunity to experience

00:32:18.025 --> 00:32:24.125
my best for you any, and really, if you
think about it, you're grieving him.

00:32:24.365 --> 00:32:28.535
And I think about this when my
kids, my older kids, especially

00:32:28.775 --> 00:32:30.155
they know what's right.

00:32:30.395 --> 00:32:31.385
They know what's right.

00:32:31.895 --> 00:32:32.975
And they choose wrong.

00:32:34.905 --> 00:32:38.475
Breaks me, because I don't know
why they're choosing that when

00:32:38.475 --> 00:32:43.155
they know what's right, God is
looking at you as His child.

00:32:43.395 --> 00:32:45.435
And when we sin against
him, it's breaking him.

00:32:46.275 --> 00:32:48.105
And he's saying, that's
not my best for you.

00:32:48.135 --> 00:32:49.725
That's not the best for you.

00:32:49.755 --> 00:32:51.045
Why are you choosing that?

00:32:51.735 --> 00:32:56.565
And so in sincerity, when we were
pinned, we recognize we hurt the Lord.

00:32:56.565 --> 00:32:57.255
Jesus.

00:32:58.785 --> 00:33:00.225
He doesn't desire that force.

00:33:00.225 --> 00:33:01.635
He wants what's best for him.

00:33:02.639 --> 00:33:06.030
And so as a believer, it's hard sometimes
when we had the head knowledge of

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:11.100
what we're , but we don't get it into
the heart of what true repentance is.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.919
And this king displays what it looks like.

00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:16.649
So why, and this is the important part.

00:33:16.649 --> 00:33:21.240
I think we need to think about why did
the king end up repenting this way?

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.399
Which is that short message, right.

00:33:23.399 --> 00:33:25.350
And 40 days Nineveh will be demolished.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:30.540
And I think verse nine kind of tells us
the reason why is because he's realizing

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:34.950
this who knows rather than living
it up for the next several days, who

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:37.800
knows maybe God will turn and relent.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:39.540
He may turn from His burning anger.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.130
So we will not perish.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.450
You know, he didn't know he had no
clue whether God was going to do

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:51.000
that, but he had to one of two ways
to go either to God or away from God.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:56.380
When we have sin in our lives and we
recognize it, we have two ways to go.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.790
We can either go to God or when go away
from God and he chose the right way.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:01.900
And let me share this.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.670
And maybe he knew Proverbs 28, 13.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:07.030
I don't think he probably did,
but Proverbs 28 13 says this, the

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:11.020
one who conceals his sin will not
prosper, but one who confesses and

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.450
renounces them will find mercy.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:16.780
So this king found exactly
what that verse said.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.389
He found mercy, he was willing
to do whatever it takes

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:20.710
to see God would release.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.370
How desperate are we to
be forgiven of our sin?

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:31.520
Are we desperate enough to put on
sackcloth and ashes publicly display that

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.530
we're broken and in need of a savior?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.330
I would say at times, guys, I
would say I'm great at that.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.500
But at many times I don't, I just
want to say a prayer and move on.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.310
So I'm not telling you today to
go put on sackcloth and ashes and

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:50.480
maybe you need to, but I think that
this king tells us that it's hard.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.840
Not necessarily an outward issue
because we can come to church and

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.650
seemed like we had all together.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:56.550
It's a heart issue.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:57.690
It's an inward issue.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.360
So you can put on the sackcloth and
ashes, but if you don't have the

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:05.640
inward conviction of what your sin is,
you're really missing the point of it.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.290
That's the last thing is, is the Kings
model of repentance pays off, right?

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:14.790
Verse 10 says God saw their actions that
they had turned from their evil ways.

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:17.850
And so God relented from the
disaster he had threatened them with.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:18.620
And he did not.

00:35:19.845 --> 00:35:24.105
How do we know that they truly
repented God relented, God relented.

00:35:25.425 --> 00:35:31.455
And I don't know about you guys just
kind of say this, that D do you celebrate

00:35:32.325 --> 00:35:34.815
whenever somebody repents, do you
celebrate whenever somebody gives her

00:35:34.815 --> 00:35:39.645
life to Jesus, do you celebrate even with
yourself at times when you repent and

00:35:39.645 --> 00:35:41.055
you recognize the Lord's forgives you?

00:35:41.805 --> 00:35:42.615
I think we should.

00:35:43.425 --> 00:35:44.085
I think we should be.

00:35:44.085 --> 00:35:45.885
We should look at it as,
as this is a big deal.

00:35:46.935 --> 00:35:50.055
When there's a sin in your life
or something that is not valuable

00:35:50.055 --> 00:35:54.105
for you and you turn from it, you
should celebrate with praise and

00:35:54.105 --> 00:35:59.205
Thanksgiving to a God who gloriously
loves you and wants to forgive you.

00:35:59.535 --> 00:36:02.335
We should celebrate with one
another, rather than judging one.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:04.980
That maybe your sense different than mine.

00:36:05.009 --> 00:36:05.850
We should celebrate.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.640
When one center in the Bible talks
about that there's angels in heaven

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.160
who celebrate my pastor told me this.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.920
When I gave my life to Christ, I walked
down the front and he said, I want you to

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.000
know today there's angels in heaven that
are celebrating, throwing a party because

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.860
of one center who repented in that shoe,
man, that was surprise what guys that

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.450
happens every day that we were paying.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:25.799
Cause that center they
talk about, it's not.

00:36:26.595 --> 00:36:28.305
One time giving your life to Jesus.

00:36:28.485 --> 00:36:30.975
Cause that's an obviously to
celebrate, but it's daily repentance.

00:36:30.975 --> 00:36:33.015
We should celebrate
because God forgave us.

00:36:33.045 --> 00:36:33.495
Wow.

00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:34.515
Like we should celebrate.

00:36:34.515 --> 00:36:37.935
So I think of this and I'm like, I
was reading this and I was like, I'm

00:36:37.935 --> 00:36:41.235
celebrating right now for the 120,000
that repented and God forgave him.

00:36:41.505 --> 00:36:42.375
This is awesome.

00:36:42.585 --> 00:36:43.485
This is great.

00:36:44.655 --> 00:36:47.505
And so I want to ask this question.

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:51.645
Do you ever wonder if what you do matter.

00:36:53.805 --> 00:36:56.835
And if you're questioning saying
men, if what I do as a follower

00:36:56.835 --> 00:36:57.945
of Jesus, does it matter?

00:36:57.945 --> 00:36:59.535
What does I do as a non-polar Jesus?

00:36:59.535 --> 00:37:00.225
Does it matter?

00:37:00.615 --> 00:37:01.455
Absolutely.

00:37:01.785 --> 00:37:04.005
Because they chose to
respond the correct way.

00:37:04.095 --> 00:37:08.385
It mattered for eternity and
for them and their destruction.

00:37:08.955 --> 00:37:10.275
And it matters for us as well.

00:37:11.265 --> 00:37:13.335
So you may have the same
question that I have.

00:37:13.335 --> 00:37:16.305
How do we know what true
repentance looks like for them?

00:37:16.305 --> 00:37:19.815
It was easy when I say it was
easy because after it was at 40

00:37:19.815 --> 00:37:20.985
days, they didn't get destroyed.

00:37:20.985 --> 00:37:24.015
So the know, Hey, my root,
my repentance was real.

00:37:24.015 --> 00:37:29.295
And, and for you guys, you may say, how do
I know if the way I'm repenting is real?

00:37:29.415 --> 00:37:31.215
And, and again, I'm telling you this.

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:32.565
I had asked myself the same question.

00:37:32.715 --> 00:37:34.275
This is why I'm here to
answer those questions.

00:37:34.275 --> 00:37:35.045
Cause I had to ask that same.

00:37:36.255 --> 00:37:39.495
The Bible says this in Luke three
eight, it says, therefore, produce

00:37:39.495 --> 00:37:41.445
fruit consistent with repentance.

00:37:42.105 --> 00:37:45.465
So there's proof of true repentance.

00:37:46.455 --> 00:37:48.735
So someone give me, I want, I'd
love somebody to give me what

00:37:48.735 --> 00:37:50.415
would be proof of true repentance.

00:37:50.475 --> 00:37:54.555
Give me maybe an example of what
proof of true repentance would be.

00:38:01.405 --> 00:38:01.915
There you go.

00:38:05.205 --> 00:38:06.435
Yeah, there's a couple, right?

00:38:06.615 --> 00:38:09.465
I mean, I think, I think you can, you
can begin to say that it's practical.

00:38:09.615 --> 00:38:12.435
It's simple to see like
there's life change, right?

00:38:12.435 --> 00:38:16.215
It's not just words, but
it's response and action.

00:38:16.635 --> 00:38:19.065
And so I started thinking of, you
know, so the, when we talk about the.

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:21.660
Of true repentance.

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.779
So the fruit of the spirit, we
should know the fruit of the spirit.

00:38:24.779 --> 00:38:27.569
And I start thinking about this are
the fruit of the spirit is love, joy,

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.140
peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
faithfulness, gentleness self-control.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:35.850
And it says the law there's, uh, the
law is not against such things, right?

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.450
So when we see these fruits of the spirit
getting stronger and more consistent in

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.410
lives, we'll see proof of life change.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:47.160
Now I started thinking about this,
many of our sins fall into the

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.810
category of the opposites of these.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.330
So walk with me a little bit in this.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.310
The opposite of love is hate.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:00.570
The opposite of joy is what sorrow,
which actually that's not too bad, but

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:08.030
sometimes godly sorrow, the opposite
of peace, fear, opposite of patience,

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:14.140
not patient, the opposite of kindness.

00:39:15.825 --> 00:39:17.385
You know, I dunno, greed.

00:39:17.415 --> 00:39:17.595
Okay.

00:39:17.595 --> 00:39:17.925
That's good.

00:39:17.925 --> 00:39:21.465
One opposite of goodness, man.

00:39:21.495 --> 00:39:21.825
Right?

00:39:22.095 --> 00:39:28.605
Opposite of faithfulness, unfaithful,
opposite of gentleness, angry, harsh

00:39:28.815 --> 00:39:30.945
opposite of self-control uncontrolled.

00:39:31.755 --> 00:39:34.695
I mentioned this to you guys, because
I think at times we want to know

00:39:35.655 --> 00:39:39.135
what is proof that I have given my
life to Jesus and that I'm growing

00:39:39.135 --> 00:39:40.725
my faith for is of the spirit.

00:39:41.565 --> 00:39:46.275
W what is, what is proof that I, I'm
not living the way and I'm living

00:39:46.275 --> 00:39:49.965
against God's God's will for my life
and, and the best for my life whenever

00:39:49.965 --> 00:39:51.375
I'm doing the opposite of these things.

00:39:51.944 --> 00:39:55.035
So I'm telling you, I'm this guy, I
love that two plus two equals four.

00:39:55.035 --> 00:39:58.424
I'm a math guy, because it's always four
and don't tell me it's three or six.

00:39:58.424 --> 00:39:58.815
Okay.

00:39:58.845 --> 00:39:59.715
I'm not that guy.

00:40:00.045 --> 00:40:00.825
It's four.

00:40:01.755 --> 00:40:06.465
So sometimes with God, there are
these variables of like, we can't.

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:11.070
Get that finite number, but I
do believe when it comes to true

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.840
followers of Jesus, there is fruit.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:15.240
The Bible clearly says
there is a response.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:19.590
So when it comes to true repentance,
you will know if you've truly repented.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:24.960
If you are turning and, and choosing a
different way of living now, do we all

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.030
know at times we sin and we fall short?

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:27.660
Absolutely.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.640
But conviction brings us back.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.900
We don't hang out in it.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:31.560
Right.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.850
That's where the spirit of God.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:34.920
So I, again, I look at this story.

00:40:36.015 --> 00:40:40.275
I'm trying to end this way here
is that the king gave us a model

00:40:40.275 --> 00:40:41.595
of what repentance is, right?

00:40:41.595 --> 00:40:44.895
So he was a leader and he led out and
what it looked like to repent, and then

00:40:44.895 --> 00:40:46.635
he challenged people to repent, right.

00:40:46.815 --> 00:40:49.875
And we know that God received it for us.

00:40:49.875 --> 00:40:52.035
What do we do to take, what
do we take with this one?

00:40:52.035 --> 00:40:52.995
Every one of us is a leader.

00:40:53.025 --> 00:40:55.155
Every one of us is a leader model.

00:40:55.155 --> 00:41:00.885
It experienced true repentance in
your heart and challenge others.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:04.830
So I'll go back to the question
I said earlier, and my wife, she

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:07.410
wasn't in here when I said this, but
what does this text say about God?

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.880
I think it continues to say
this, that God desires for

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.640
everyone to come to faith in him.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:15.930
Give us a second chance.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.810
He wants us all to be in a
right relationship with him.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.460
I'm telling you that God loves you.

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:21.450
He loves you.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.370
And his name is Jesus.

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:25.560
His name is Jesus.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.600
And why does he get the right.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:32.280
To determine whether we can
be forgiven of our sins or not

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.620
because he paid the price here.

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:34.980
Here's the thing.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:39.630
Apart from Christ, if we're in sin,
we'll pay for us in one day, absolutely.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:44.730
100% we'll pay for our sin, but because
Christ came, he is the replacement of

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:45.960
the punishment that we've reserved.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.790
He got that punishment for us.

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:52.320
So when we accept, when we repent,
we're accepting Christ's payment for

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.670
our sin rather than taking an owner.

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.820
So.

00:41:54.855 --> 00:42:00.315
And when we reject Christ, we say, we
will ultimately take that punishment,

00:42:00.315 --> 00:42:02.415
whatever God gives on ourselves.

00:42:03.045 --> 00:42:06.315
I don't know about you guys, but I'm
so glad that God did that because I

00:42:06.315 --> 00:42:13.375
know I'll never be good enough to be
able to not get punishment for my sin.

00:42:13.585 --> 00:42:16.045
And so Christ paid the
ultimate price for me.

00:42:17.115 --> 00:42:21.225
So when we think about this, God gives
us the right, this second chance where

00:42:21.225 --> 00:42:23.715
he'll relent and he won't punish us
because of what Christ did on the

00:42:23.715 --> 00:42:25.395
cross, if we'll repent of our sins.

00:42:27.025 --> 00:42:34.345
But here's the thing we, we, we don't
have to be, I would say this, we

00:42:34.435 --> 00:42:35.965
are not forced into this decision.

00:42:35.965 --> 00:42:37.465
There's so many times we'll
just say, we'll wait on the

00:42:37.465 --> 00:42:39.055
Lord to make it right with us.

00:42:39.055 --> 00:42:40.495
Now we have to make this choice.

00:42:41.035 --> 00:42:44.745
So when I ask this question, just as
we go into a time of invitation, And

00:42:44.745 --> 00:42:48.225
I share this every week because I want
to be clear as possible too many times.

00:42:48.735 --> 00:42:50.925
And, and maybe I'm, I'm, I've
been a part of this too many

00:42:50.925 --> 00:42:52.035
times when it comes invitation.

00:42:52.035 --> 00:42:53.715
Everybody's like, I don't
know what this time is for.

00:42:54.255 --> 00:42:55.275
Is it for this person?

00:42:55.275 --> 00:42:56.055
Is it for this person?

00:42:56.055 --> 00:42:57.885
Is it just for the worship
band to play one more song?

00:42:57.885 --> 00:42:59.085
Cause they love music so much.

00:42:59.265 --> 00:43:01.035
Yes, no, I'm joking.

00:43:01.455 --> 00:43:09.775
Um, invitation is a time to take
everything and I hope God touch you

00:43:09.775 --> 00:43:12.685
something and say, Lord, what is.

00:43:13.665 --> 00:43:15.465
What is it that I need
to apply to my life?

00:43:15.975 --> 00:43:18.615
You know, is there a sin in my
life that I need to repent of?

00:43:18.615 --> 00:43:21.975
Is there something in my path,
my life that is not valuable for

00:43:21.975 --> 00:43:23.085
me, that I needed to turn from?

00:43:23.235 --> 00:43:26.025
Is there someone I need to invite
into my life for accountability

00:43:26.025 --> 00:43:27.435
to help me overcome this sin?

00:43:27.795 --> 00:43:31.215
Is it time for me to fully surrender
to God, to give my life to Jesus?

00:43:31.965 --> 00:43:33.015
Maybe that's you today.

00:43:33.495 --> 00:43:35.655
Maybe you have not given
your life to Jesus.

00:43:35.955 --> 00:43:37.335
And you're asking the question.

00:43:37.575 --> 00:43:40.545
Maybe you don't know if
you have, where do you go?

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:44.310
Talk to somebody and, and I built
enough of a relationship with

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:45.420
the majority of you in this room.

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:49.560
I hope, um, that I'm going to
be back there during invitation.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.090
And my goal is to just talk with you.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:52.590
I'm not here to condemn you.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:54.300
I'm not here to call you out.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:57.840
I'm not going to put you up publicly just
to make you, Hey, this guy just did this.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.800
I want to help, you know, Jesus.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.790
I want to help you take a
next step in your faith then.

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:06.570
Do you really mean that?

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.230
Absolutely.

00:44:07.259 --> 00:44:07.680
100.

00:44:09.315 --> 00:44:12.315
Even if you don't know me very
well, I desire to help you take

00:44:12.315 --> 00:44:14.805
a next step because I think every
person in this room, every person

00:44:15.404 --> 00:44:17.775
has a next step closer to Jesus.

00:44:18.045 --> 00:44:21.165
And if I can be a part of it,
please let me be a part of it.

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:24.944
Don't leave today without asking God
during this time of invitation, what it is

00:44:25.185 --> 00:44:28.725
that you need to do surrender and say yes.

00:44:29.595 --> 00:44:33.465
And tell someone, Hey, today,
I've committed to this.

00:44:33.585 --> 00:44:35.085
Hey, today I've repented to this.

00:44:35.325 --> 00:44:36.045
Hey, today.

00:44:37.305 --> 00:44:42.285
Allow it to be a public profession
to God, and we'll continue to see

00:44:42.285 --> 00:44:43.455
life change all in your lives.

00:44:43.455 --> 00:44:44.325
But here's the greatest one.

00:44:44.325 --> 00:44:48.735
I'm gonna say this last thing because
of your repentance and life of living,

00:44:48.735 --> 00:44:51.195
it you'll change other people's lives.

00:44:52.725 --> 00:44:56.085
I'm telling you want to present.

00:44:56.625 --> 00:44:59.985
God wants to use you to help
other people come to know him and

00:44:59.985 --> 00:45:01.305
receive the same grace and mercy.

00:45:01.305 --> 00:45:01.515
You've bring.

00:45:02.535 --> 00:45:04.815
So let's pray, Lord, Jesus, Lord.

00:45:04.815 --> 00:45:05.445
We love you.

00:45:05.445 --> 00:45:10.365
And we thank you so much for your word
and Jonah Lord, where you have taught us.

00:45:11.325 --> 00:45:17.235
You've taught us what it means to truly
repent Lord, where we will lay down

00:45:17.235 --> 00:45:20.955
every, um, thing that Lord hinders us.

00:45:21.495 --> 00:45:24.885
Every sin that hinders us Lord,
and we become broken before

00:45:24.885 --> 00:45:27.435
you publicly and inwardly.

00:45:27.915 --> 00:45:30.405
And we say, Lord, we are desperate
for your mercy and grace.

00:45:31.515 --> 00:45:35.565
Lord, no matter if we've been believers
for 50 years or we haven't given

00:45:35.565 --> 00:45:39.585
our lives to you, Lord that grace
and mercy is there every single day.

00:45:39.585 --> 00:45:43.485
If we will repent, which means
this Lord, if we'll turn from our

00:45:43.485 --> 00:45:47.595
sin, if we'll recognize, whatever
we're doing is not valuable for us.

00:45:47.595 --> 00:45:52.395
And we begin to say what you have for us
is more valuable, the right way of living.

00:45:53.685 --> 00:45:56.595
So Lord, I pray today that every
one of us considers what it is.

00:45:57.935 --> 00:46:02.075
That maybe we are holding back from you
and saying, Lord, no, we feel justified in

00:46:02.075 --> 00:46:04.625
this to keep Lord, may they surrender it?

00:46:04.625 --> 00:46:05.615
May I surrender it?

00:46:06.455 --> 00:46:09.545
And Lord, if it's today, someone that
doesn't know you or where they just need

00:46:09.545 --> 00:46:14.435
to fully repent of their sins and truly
trust in you for the first time, Lord, I

00:46:14.435 --> 00:46:18.305
pray that you send them Lord to come talk
to me during this time of invitation.

00:46:19.384 --> 00:46:23.734
Lord, I just pray that they do not let
another day go by before they give their

00:46:23.734 --> 00:46:25.595
lives to you and recognize their need for.

00:46:27.195 --> 00:46:29.415
Lord, we just celebrate what you're
doing in this church and what

00:46:29.415 --> 00:46:30.585
you're going to continue to do.

00:46:31.245 --> 00:46:32.625
3, 2, 1 of our hearts and minds orders.

00:46:32.625 --> 00:46:36.015
We take the next right
step towards you, Lord.

00:46:36.015 --> 00:46:36.585
We love you.

00:46:36.585 --> 00:46:37.815
And we pray this in
your head and the name.

00:46:38.445 --> 00:46:38.805
Amen.

00:46:40.725 --> 00:46:42.705
If you'll stand with us as we worship.
