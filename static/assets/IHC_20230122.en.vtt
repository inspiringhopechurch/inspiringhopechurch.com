00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.790
I want you to remember that God,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.730
God's created everything you see.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.450
He breathed it into existence.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.470
You remember when his people were
caught up in slavery, he rescued them.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.560
What he did was he parted the sea.

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:34.875
And he made a way for them and then he
delivered their enemies to them and he

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:40.785
unlocks wounds and he provides water from
a rock and he provides man of from heaven,

00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:43.635
and he brought down the walls of Jericho.

00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:46.485
He froze the sun, allowing victory.

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:48.735
He's topple giants with tiny stones.

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:50.504
He's brought fire from heaven.

00:00:51.105 --> 00:00:52.364
The mouths of lions.

00:00:52.544 --> 00:00:54.735
He preserved life in the belly of a well.

00:00:54.944 --> 00:00:57.375
He's fed thousands with a few lows.

00:00:57.584 --> 00:00:59.065
He gives the weak strength.

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.760
He heals the sick.

00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:03.525
He's made the blind sea, the deaf
beer, the mute speak to let him

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:05.535
walk, and he's overcome evil.

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:09.345
And he's made a way through death
for you and me by the death and the

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:14.414
resurrection as a son, Jesus Christ,
that we will live with him forever.

00:01:14.414 --> 00:01:18.265
We will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever and ever.

00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:19.515
And ever and ever.

00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:20.655
What are we afraid?

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:26.685
His resume is flawless.

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:32.445
He controls everything and he loves you.

00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:44.775
Well, it is, uh, definitely
different being in this space.

00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:48.825
So I know for some of you, this may be the
first time you've ever been here and this.

00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:51.164
Just as new to you as it is to us.

00:01:51.164 --> 00:01:54.494
So welcome to our first service
again here in the Y M C A.

00:01:54.494 --> 00:01:58.005
One of the things that's so funny
is, um, I was talking with Matt, so

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:01.485
Matt does our music and media and,
uh, he says We're gonna do everything

00:02:01.485 --> 00:02:04.574
we can this week to break something,
which means like, so we know what's

00:02:04.574 --> 00:02:06.315
going on, how the space is gonna work.

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:10.604
Well, good news we did, didn't
break it, it just stopped working

00:02:10.634 --> 00:02:11.505
the right side of the speaker.

00:02:11.505 --> 00:02:12.615
If you didn't notice that in the music.

00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:16.365
So those of you on the, you know, I
guess it'd be your right side here.

00:02:16.425 --> 00:02:18.195
You didn't hear half the
music at This still is.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.799
Uh, we figured it out.

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.769
What it is, just like any technology,
you just turn it off and turn it back on.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.200
That's about all I know what
to do with stuff, and that's

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.040
what they did and it worked.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.510
So, um, we officially broke something
that success and we'll keep trying.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.980
So, um, excited about today,
getting the opportunity to share

00:02:34.984 --> 00:02:36.390
with you outta the book of Joshua.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.810
We're gonna be in the book of Joshua
chapter one in the first nine verses.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.100
Um, and, uh, God just kind of gave
me this text as I began to think

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.640
through, um, moving into a new space.

00:02:48.475 --> 00:02:52.650
and uh, thinking about the changes
that are coming and what's gonna

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.140
happen and man, are we prepared?

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.660
And, and then it just made me
think about Joshua cuz Joshua.

00:02:58.035 --> 00:03:02.385
Um, took over for Moses and he was
leading the people into the promised Land.

00:03:02.655 --> 00:03:06.945
So just so you know, I'm not comparing
us to like that journey cuz that's

00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:08.565
pretty significant and some things.

00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:13.245
But we can learn, let's put it this way,
we can learn from their journey in that.

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:16.815
And so, um, one of the things that
we're gonna highlight through this

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.415
as we walk through this is the idea
of the priority of the word of God,

00:03:20.415 --> 00:03:22.305
the priority of the word of God.

00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:23.425
So I wanna ask this question.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.570
Have you ever felt guilty for not
prioritizing something in your life?

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.050
Anybody?

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.080
I mean, for some of us it's like, I'm,
I, I need to prioritize fitness, you

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.340
know, I need to prioritize health.

00:03:35.345 --> 00:03:36.870
I need to prioritize family.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.470
Um, and maybe even some of you
are very similar to me, where it's

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.560
like, man, I need to prioritize
prayer and get into the word.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.830
But something always
seems to stop us, right?

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.030
We, we get too busy.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.460
Um, there, there's something about, uh,
whatever we're saying we need to priorit.

00:03:54.105 --> 00:03:56.745
We don't have enough time or
we don't have enough effort.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:00.855
Um, and when I think about this idea of
not having enough time, usually that's

00:04:00.855 --> 00:04:03.795
one of the things that I'll hear myself
say is I just don't have enough time.

00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:05.894
Uh, I heard this from Vance Pittman.

00:04:06.075 --> 00:04:10.095
He said this one time, he says, if
there's more on your to-do list,

00:04:10.095 --> 00:04:12.015
then you have time to complete.

00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:14.565
Then there's something on
that list that God didn't put.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.149
. And that really challenged
me because it's that idea.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.269
So you guys know this, I am a list maker.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.730
Like I like writing down
everything I need to do.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.620
The thing that's always interesting.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.760
I never get it all done.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.270
And, and that challenges me and the idea
of going like, what am I doing on this?

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.820
Or what am I putting on this list
that's just not valuable for me in

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.409
this season of life or in this day.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.900
Um, and what is it that I'm putting
there that God's not putting?

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.640
And so, um, again, I love asking
questions before we jump into this text.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.890
I love asking questions when it comes
to the word of God, and we talk about

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.260
needing to prioritize the word of God.

00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:52.050
What, what do you struggle
with the most when it comes

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:52.950
to getting to the word of God?

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.260
I'll start first because
then you guys won't feel like

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.460
you're the only ones talking.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.280
I struggle prioritizing God's word.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.940
What usually distracts me from it
is when I do say, oh, I need this,

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.990
and I get into the word of God.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.510
I will catch myself literally stopping.

00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:10.395
and starting to scroll social
media, stopping and making lists

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:13.335
of things I need to do, and all of
a sudden I'm going, what happened?

00:05:13.364 --> 00:05:15.705
So I get easily distracted
by the things around us.

00:05:15.794 --> 00:05:19.364
So what stops you from prioritizing
the word of God in your life?

00:05:19.395 --> 00:05:20.594
What do you guys stro with?

00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:21.284
What stops you?

00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:25.155
Anybody worried?

00:05:25.155 --> 00:05:25.784
Distractions.

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.044
What was life?

00:05:28.575 --> 00:05:29.565
No brain power.

00:05:30.015 --> 00:05:31.485
That's usually the end of the day for me.

00:05:31.485 --> 00:05:35.085
If I ever say I'm gonna read at the
end of the day, that's funny because

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:37.515
that's just not gonna happen usually
cuz I don't have the brain power.

00:05:37.515 --> 00:05:37.815
Right.

00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:42.075
Um, so I would even say this at times,
being motivated to prioritizing the word.

00:05:42.195 --> 00:05:44.625
Sometimes it's because, does
anybody ever understand that?

00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:45.765
Like the word is confusing.

00:05:46.065 --> 00:05:47.625
So I'm walking through a Bible plan.

00:05:48.135 --> 00:05:52.005
Um, I'm in, uh, Leviticus, the
back end of Exodus, Leviticus,

00:05:52.425 --> 00:05:56.594
and I'm like, Ugh, this is boring.

00:05:57.664 --> 00:06:00.344
. And here's the thing, it's good stuff
cuz it's genealogies and it helps us

00:06:00.344 --> 00:06:04.034
understand how to get to, you know, Jesus
and the story of everything we needed.

00:06:04.094 --> 00:06:07.065
But it's like, ah, really this chapter.

00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:08.205
And so I get it.

00:06:08.205 --> 00:06:10.544
Sometimes it's confusing, but I
wanna ask the other side, because I

00:06:10.544 --> 00:06:11.625
don't wanna just think negative here.

00:06:11.715 --> 00:06:15.224
What do you enjoy the most
about studying the word of God?

00:06:15.224 --> 00:06:16.215
What do you enjoy the most?

00:06:17.864 --> 00:06:18.284
Anybody.

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:19.395
What's that?

00:06:19.905 --> 00:06:20.294
Peace.

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:20.924
That's awesome.

00:06:21.585 --> 00:06:22.245
What else?

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:24.885
Yes.

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:26.294
Like when God just like, ah.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:27.075
. Right.

00:06:27.284 --> 00:06:28.065
Anything else?

00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:31.155
Rush perspective?

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:31.844
Absolutely.

00:06:32.505 --> 00:06:36.105
I think as we begin to get into the word,
if you have spent time getting into the

00:06:36.105 --> 00:06:40.305
word and prioritizing it in your life,
you'll see God speaking directly to you.

00:06:40.305 --> 00:06:41.715
It is life changing.

00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:46.695
Um, but I, I would say this, I think
most of us at times in our lives and

00:06:46.695 --> 00:06:50.805
in our seasons, uh, have struggled
with the idea of seeing the value

00:06:50.805 --> 00:06:52.945
of reading and studying the word of.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.460
Um, and, and so I just kinda wanna
give you a couple of examples here.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.240
Think about this.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.930
Does anybody struggle to desire to sleep?

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.670
Like, I love sleeping.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.340
I didn't sleep much last
night, but I love sleeping.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.250
Oh, let me just, let me step
out to those who love food.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.890
Does anybody struggle to actually eat?

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.340
I mean, like, I like eating
and we all probably try to eat

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.270
at least three times a day.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.110
And if you're me, it's.

00:07:17.105 --> 00:07:17.130
. Okay.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.120
Because we like eating.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.490
So it's not hard to prioritize sleep.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.410
It's not hard to PR unless
you have a young baby.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.370
And that's different, okay?

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.010
Uh, but it's not hard to prioritize
sleep in eating because it's,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.410
it's a natural desire in our lives
to fulfill a need that we have.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.400
Does that make sense?

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.280
So if I sleep, I wake up in a better
mood and this is gonna keep falling.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.080
Um, I wake up in a better mood.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.640
Um, if I eat, I'm not, uh, Betty
White where I need a Snickers, right?

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.830
Those things are valuable to.

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:46.935
. So I wanna flip this a little bit.

00:07:47.505 --> 00:07:50.115
When we prioritize the
word of God, what if?

00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:56.505
What if we thought about, man, if I don't
get into the word of God, then it is

00:07:56.505 --> 00:07:58.815
going to be something lacking in my life.

00:07:59.175 --> 00:08:01.785
Like lacking of sleep,
like lacking of food.

00:08:02.445 --> 00:08:06.255
And I think what happens is, is we have
seasons, we'll get into the word of God

00:08:06.255 --> 00:08:09.255
and it really fuels us and it changes
our lives and we're prioritizing it.

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:10.695
And man, it's just going great.

00:08:10.695 --> 00:08:11.985
And then distractions.

00:08:13.155 --> 00:08:16.335
And it gets us away from it and it
makes us think that, you know, all

00:08:16.335 --> 00:08:19.784
these other things on our list are
more important than the word of God.

00:08:20.335 --> 00:08:23.145
I, I would, I really just wanna
challenge you today as we jump into

00:08:23.145 --> 00:08:24.614
this, that number one, you're not alone.

00:08:24.614 --> 00:08:27.645
Cuz I'm, I struggle as well, even
as a pastor at times, to get into

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.645
the word of God and prioritize it
because I feel like I'm a doer, right?

00:08:30.645 --> 00:08:34.184
I love doing things, which means
that I, at times, I prioritize doing

00:08:34.184 --> 00:08:36.525
things over spending time with Jesus.

00:08:36.674 --> 00:08:40.784
And I get those mixed up where I need to
spend time with Jesus to know what to.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.570
And so we're gonna see this where
Joshua was challenged by God to

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.150
prioritize the word of God, right?

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.200
To prioritize the word of God.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.670
So I'm hoping that we'll
learn a valuable lesson.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.340
So let me just give you a quick background
and then we're gonna read, because I

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.820
don't wanna just jump off in Joshua
and you say, Hey, how did we get here?

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.480
So just remember Genesis, EXUS,
Leviticus, numbers, Deuteronomy.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.650
Joshua Judges.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.490
I think I got that right.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:02.910
Somewhere in there.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.000
Okay.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.380
What happened before then?

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.260
So we know that obviously
creation happened.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.550
We have, uh, the fall happened,
we have Noah and the flood, and

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.660
we have all these things, right?

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.700
But you guys remember the
character Abraham, right?

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.110
God promised Abraham that he
would make his descendants

00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:20.750
as many as the stars, right?

00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:23.850
And, uh, he promised all these things.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.060
And one of the things that he promised
is that as he would make them as many

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:32.310
as the stars, that one day they would
be enslaved for 400 years before that

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.699
they would experience this promised
land that God had promised Abraham.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.260
Um, and we're, so, we're kind of coming
outta that story where Moses, while the,

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.730
the people of Israel, uh, were enslaved
in Egypt for 400 years, Moses was

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.400
called by God to lead the people out of.

00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:49.665
Egypt to the Promised Land.

00:09:50.205 --> 00:09:52.125
Um, and so there's a cool
stories with that, right?

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:53.805
Where all these plagues happen.

00:09:53.805 --> 00:09:57.615
And finally Pharaoh lets them go and they
go and they get to the Red Sea and God

00:09:57.615 --> 00:10:00.465
parts the Red Sea, and they walk on dry
land and they go on the other side and

00:10:00.465 --> 00:10:03.255
they're cheering and they're celebrating
because God had defeated their enemy.

00:10:03.555 --> 00:10:05.475
Um, but what we see a lot of times
with the Israelites, it's the

00:10:05.475 --> 00:10:06.555
same thing we see with ourselves.

00:10:06.765 --> 00:10:08.715
They begin to complain and
grumble because they had forgot

00:10:08.715 --> 00:10:09.585
what God had done for them.

00:10:10.005 --> 00:10:12.795
And so Moses began to lead these
people towards the Promised

00:10:12.795 --> 00:10:13.605
Land, but there came this.

00:10:14.805 --> 00:10:19.905
Where God said, go take the land, and the
majority of the people of Israel said no.

00:10:21.015 --> 00:10:25.185
And so at that moment, God said, anybody
20 years and older would wander in the

00:10:25.185 --> 00:10:29.255
wilderness and tell their death before
the next generation would inherit.

00:10:30.555 --> 00:10:31.935
The the promised Lamb.

00:10:32.295 --> 00:10:34.995
And so this is where we're picking
up at the end of Moses's life.

00:10:34.995 --> 00:10:38.835
God, at something that Moses had done
in his life, God said you would not

00:10:38.835 --> 00:10:41.955
experience the Promised Land, which
means this Moses would not lead the

00:10:41.955 --> 00:10:45.555
people of Israel into the Promised Lamb,
so he was going to die, and when he

00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:47.115
died, there needed to be somebody that.

00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:51.480
Stepped up somebody that got appointed to
lead the people into the promised Land.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.640
So I know it kind of did a quick
summary, but that's where we're at.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:58.500
Joshua was being appointed as that person
to lead the people into the promised land.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.550
And so we're gonna pick up
here and read, um, this text.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.390
So let's read it here.

00:11:03.689 --> 00:11:08.100
Joshua chapter one, verse one says
this, after the death of Moses, the Lord

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.500
servant, the Lord spoke to Joshua, son of.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.520
Moses's assistant Moses,
my servant is dead.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.360
Now you and all the people prepared
to cross over the Jordan to the

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.100
land I'm giving the Israelites.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.630
I have given you every place where
the soul of your foot treads, just as

00:11:24.635 --> 00:11:28.230
I promise Moses, your territory will
be from the wilderness and Lebanon.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.150
To the great river of the Euphrates
River and all the land of the

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.470
Hittites and West to the Mediterranean
Sea, no one will be able to stand

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.330
against you as long as you live.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.760
And I will be with you
just as I was with Moses.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.600
And I will not leave you or abandon you.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:50.130
Be strong and courageous for you will
distribute the land I swore to their

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.960
fathers to give them an inheritance.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.170
Above all, be strong and
very courageous to observe

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.570
carefully the whole instruction.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:02.850
My servant Moses commanded you Do not
turn to it to the right or to the left so

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.531
that you will have success wherever you.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.130
This book of instruction must
not depart from your mouth.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.390
You are to meditate on it day and
night so that you may carefully observe

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.270
everything written in it for then you'll
prosper and succeed in whatever you do.

00:12:18.015 --> 00:12:19.005
Haven't I commanded you?

00:12:19.005 --> 00:12:20.565
Be strong, courageous.

00:12:20.655 --> 00:12:25.875
Do not be afraid or discourage for the
Lord your God is with you wherever you go.

00:12:26.085 --> 00:12:26.505
Let's pray.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.955
Lord Jesus, we pray as we read your
word and as we dive in deeper, Lord,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.675
that our hearts and minds are open to
be changed, Lord, that we can leave

00:12:33.675 --> 00:12:38.475
outta here, uh, filled out by your
word and, uh, sent out to go experience

00:12:38.475 --> 00:12:42.165
more and more of you and to be able to
share that love, um, with other people.

00:12:42.225 --> 00:12:43.575
And so we just pray this
in your heaven name.

00:12:45.675 --> 00:12:50.265
So as we look at this book of Joshua,
it's really a book of new beginnings,

00:12:50.565 --> 00:12:52.965
um, right new beginning for them
because they're going into a new land.

00:12:52.965 --> 00:12:55.815
And I started thinking just like
where we are at as a church,

00:12:55.815 --> 00:12:56.925
but also in the new year.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.635
So this is personally,
but also as a church.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.275
As a church, we're moving into
a new space as an individual.

00:13:01.275 --> 00:13:04.785
It's a new year, and most of us who here
has set some sort of a New Year's goal.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.795
Anybody, couple people, right?

00:13:06.975 --> 00:13:08.265
And if you're like me, you set.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.500
and at some point you forget it.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:10.890
Right.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:11.640
We just give up.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.900
We don't, we don't end up doing it.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.580
But I'm hoping, and I'm
believing those who did raise

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.480
your hand, you're gonna make it.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.820
I believe in you cuz I said a few as well.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.690
Um, but I, I think of this as this
idea of this new beginnings and it's an

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.850
opportunity to kind of push away the past.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.080
And that's what the people
of Israel are doing.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.870
They were pushing away the past
sins and the past disobedience and

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.220
they're saying, Hey, we're going full
force ahead into this new promised.

00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:36.375
And when we think about this experience
that Joshua and the people of Israel were

00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:38.795
going to experience, one of the things
that we're gonna experience was blessing.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.324
And you're gonna see this where God
was going to bless them with the

00:13:41.324 --> 00:13:43.214
new land, full of milk and honey.

00:13:43.214 --> 00:13:44.444
And a lot of times this
is what he would say.

00:13:44.954 --> 00:13:47.474
And I think that's something
that God has for us today.

00:13:47.479 --> 00:13:50.925
So my hope is that we will
learn how God encourage.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.255
, uh, Joshua and how God will encourage us.

00:13:54.255 --> 00:13:57.105
So we're gonna walk through these
different things in the text and then

00:13:57.105 --> 00:14:00.495
we're gonna lean into the priority
of the word of God whenever we get

00:14:00.495 --> 00:14:01.965
there in verses seven and eight.

00:14:02.235 --> 00:14:07.125
So the first thing we see here is
that Joshua received encouragement

00:14:07.335 --> 00:14:10.125
from God's commission, and we
see this in the first two verses

00:14:10.125 --> 00:14:12.285
here, where God now says Moses is.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:18.900
And Joshua Moses assistant will be the
one that leads, right, prepares the people

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.630
to give them the new land in Israel.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.890
So at this point, God is
speaking directly to Joshua.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.650
Now that may not seem like much,
and again, if you're anything like

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.840
me, we study the word of God and
sometimes we miss these pieces.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.890
But God was literally
speaking directly to Joshua.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:35.280
How cool.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:36.660
God.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.100
I mean, I don't know what
his voice sounds like.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.500
Uh, usually it's in my head as
I'm reading the word of God.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.280
It's the spirit of God.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.310
But I don't know what it sounded
like to Joshua, but to hear God

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.200
say, Joshua, you are my man.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.500
You're the person that's
gonna lead these people up.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.010
Um, I think that that would be difficult
because he's replacing Moses, which

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.960
had done some amazing things, right?

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.770
So God was commissioning Joshua to
do three things, lead the people

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.010
into the land, defeat the enemy,
and claim the inheritance that

00:15:02.015 --> 00:15:03.270
was promised all the way back to.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.339
Seems simple, right?

00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:08.130
I mean, maybe, but I don't think it is.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:08.969
It was not very simple.

00:15:08.969 --> 00:15:10.890
If you read the rest of the book,
it was actually pretty difficult.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.959
Um, but God could have sent anyone,
but he chose Joshua and he equipped

00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:17.219
him and prepared him for the task.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.750
So I want you to think
about this for a moment.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.010
I love being able to take a step back.

00:15:20.099 --> 00:15:22.260
We're gonna learn from
Joshua's call, right?

00:15:22.349 --> 00:15:23.959
God commissioned Joshua.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.270
And Joshua was encouraged by that
because God thought so much of him.

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:31.469
Have you ever thought
that God has commissioned.

00:15:32.715 --> 00:15:36.255
God has spoke directly
to you through his word.

00:15:36.705 --> 00:15:40.245
Uh, if you've given your life to Christ
and that calling, I've given your life to

00:15:40.245 --> 00:15:42.525
Christ, God has said, you are important.

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:45.885
You are part of fulfilling the
mission that God has for you.

00:15:46.515 --> 00:15:48.525
And as you begin to think
about this, this is God.

00:15:48.525 --> 00:15:51.495
This is not just like your boss that
wants to give you a raise or promotion

00:15:51.675 --> 00:15:52.995
and you, and you love that, right?

00:15:53.295 --> 00:15:56.295
This isn't just your spouse who gives you
a compliment on whatever you're doing.

00:15:56.475 --> 00:15:56.625
No.

00:15:56.625 --> 00:16:00.194
This is God that is saying,
did, did you realize that I am

00:16:00.194 --> 00:16:04.515
calling you, I am commissioning
you into this new season of life.

00:16:04.515 --> 00:16:06.944
So for you, it could be the new
year for the new season of life as

00:16:06.944 --> 00:16:09.645
a church, God has commissioned us.

00:16:10.064 --> 00:16:12.345
I just tell you, that's pretty cool.

00:16:13.194 --> 00:16:16.095
I, I think it's really cool that God
lets us be a part of his mission.

00:16:16.095 --> 00:16:17.685
He doesn't just say, Hey, sit back.

00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:20.355
You know, sit down and stay outta the.

00:16:21.345 --> 00:16:21.525
No.

00:16:21.525 --> 00:16:27.135
God says, my number one purpose to
fulfill the mission is through you.

00:16:27.824 --> 00:16:30.405
So today, as you're thinking
about this New year, right?

00:16:30.405 --> 00:16:33.584
This new season as a church,
God has commissioned us and I

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.975
think it should be encouraging
to us that God chose us, right?

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.365
His mission is to see people come to
know him, and to have a relationship

00:16:40.365 --> 00:16:43.665
with him, to see lives restored,
families reunited in cities.

00:16:44.805 --> 00:16:47.535
I, you know, you guys have heard us
probably talk about this, but our mission

00:16:47.535 --> 00:16:52.155
as a church is to inspire hope by helping
people discover God's purpose for their

00:16:52.155 --> 00:16:53.865
life through relationship with Jesus.

00:16:53.865 --> 00:16:57.375
We believe as we spend time with Jesus,
as we have a relationship with Jesus,

00:16:57.465 --> 00:17:01.515
God will transform our lives to help
people fulfill their God-given purpose.

00:17:01.515 --> 00:17:02.475
Just like Joshua.

00:17:02.925 --> 00:17:07.935
I think that's so cool that God
has chose us, but does anybody

00:17:07.935 --> 00:17:10.155
get a little bit intimidated that,
that you're being put in that.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:14.280
I mean, if you're anything like me,
the moment that somebody asked me to do

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.469
something, I go, how am I gonna do this?

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.199
I mean, there's a couple times where
people have asked me to speak at

00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:23.010
different events, and I'm like, I'm
not good at speaking at those events.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.270
Like, how am I gonna do this?

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:25.919
And I think you would say that same thing.

00:17:25.925 --> 00:17:26.099
Okay.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:29.580
Maybe you sensed the call that God
has put on your life to be a part

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.719
of something bigger this year.

00:17:31.649 --> 00:17:34.590
But you may be asking the question,
how am I gonna fulfill this?

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:35.939
How am I going to do this?

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.469
What if I mess it up?

00:17:37.709 --> 00:17:38.610
Here's the good news.

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.229
You can't mess up what God's calling you.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.570
Because God will use you.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.990
God will empower you, and we're
gonna see how he empowered Joshua.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.870
One of the ways that he empowered
Joshua is this next part, and this

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.640
is one of my favorite parts of this.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.530
Joshua not only received encouragement
from God's commission, Joshua received

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.840
encouragement from God's promises.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.700
See, I look at promises like money.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.950
I can take it to the bank
and they'll accept it.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.390
So God's promises are something I can
take to the bank and proclaim it and live.

00:18:07.514 --> 00:18:12.135
. So let's look at some of the promises
that he gave, um, Joshua this.

00:18:12.135 --> 00:18:15.254
So in verse three, he says, I
have given you every place where

00:18:15.254 --> 00:18:16.335
the soul of your foot tread.

00:18:16.335 --> 00:18:17.355
So there's one promise.

00:18:17.534 --> 00:18:21.315
Just as I promised Mo Moses, your
territory will be from the wilderness

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.284
and the Lebanon to the great river of
Euphrates River and the land of the

00:18:24.284 --> 00:18:25.635
Hittites and the Mediterranean Sea.

00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:28.665
Then he says this, verse five
is one of the biggest ones.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.760
Verse five says, no one will
be able to stand against you.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.560
That's a promise as long as you live.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.650
Number two, I will be with
you just as I was with Moses.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:38.310
There's two.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.970
Number three, I will not
leave you or abandon you.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.050
When I look at those promises,
I, I, I couldn't help but be

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:47.280
encouraged if I was Joshua.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.660
If, if Joshua was sitting there
listening to God and God promised him

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.870
these things, he had to be empower.

00:18:55.245 --> 00:18:58.695
At that moment because Joshua got to
spend some time with Moses and watch how

00:18:58.695 --> 00:19:00.885
God's promises to Moses were fulfilled.

00:19:01.485 --> 00:19:02.835
And so that's the thing for me.

00:19:02.835 --> 00:19:07.965
At times, God's promises may not mean much
to you until you actually experience them.

00:19:08.804 --> 00:19:12.735
And as you experience them, it's
easier to believe and know that

00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:14.415
God will fulfill his promises.

00:19:14.925 --> 00:19:18.375
And so many times we live
on the promises of God.

00:19:19.915 --> 00:19:21.990
, even though we don't fully understand
how God's gonna fulfill them.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.590
There's many moments in my life and
I bet you there's many moments in

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.830
your life in faith, you believed
God for something, even though you

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.210
didn't know how God was gonna do it.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.950
This church is a great example of it.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.220
We didn't know how God was gonna do
it, but somehow he took six people.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.310
And as it doesn't look mu much
today, they're all online.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.210
Love you guys.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.570
Um, God has done something
amazing in this church and

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.860
that's just one of the examples.

00:19:45.165 --> 00:19:46.425
But here's the thing.

00:19:46.425 --> 00:19:49.544
When we trust God's promises and
step out by faith, you can be

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.705
sure that the Lord will give you
the directions that you need.

00:19:52.004 --> 00:19:53.324
I'll give you some examples here.

00:19:54.074 --> 00:19:57.435
I remember whenever I really,
since like God was calling me into,

00:19:57.435 --> 00:20:00.945
into, um, pastoral ministry, but
I didn't know what that meant.

00:20:01.274 --> 00:20:03.554
And I kept asking everybody for questions.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.104
I asked my pastor for questions, asked
the student pastor for questions.

00:20:06.104 --> 00:20:08.115
I asked my wife, cuz she's
always knowledgeable.

00:20:08.445 --> 00:20:11.445
Um, and, and nobody could give
me a really defined answer.

00:20:11.504 --> 00:20:12.885
And there was this moment.

00:20:13.784 --> 00:20:16.304
God, just, I felt like he whispered
to me, and here's what he says.

00:20:16.695 --> 00:20:20.115
He said, show me your faith
and I'll show you the way.

00:20:20.475 --> 00:20:21.465
See, I wanted the plan.

00:20:21.465 --> 00:20:24.945
I wanted him to hand me,
you'll do this, this, this, and

00:20:24.945 --> 00:20:26.205
this, and success will happen.

00:20:26.595 --> 00:20:29.835
And what God said was, my word is enough.

00:20:29.835 --> 00:20:31.455
My promises were enough.

00:20:31.455 --> 00:20:34.575
And in that moment, I committed
to surrendered ministry and

00:20:34.575 --> 00:20:35.175
didn't know what that meant.

00:20:35.175 --> 00:20:37.215
And God has taken me as
far as he's taken me.

00:20:37.215 --> 00:20:41.024
And I believe that will be the
same thing for all of us In faith.

00:20:41.235 --> 00:20:44.085
We accept God's promises and we'll see.

00:20:44.085 --> 00:20:46.665
If you were to study the rest of the
book of Joshua, we won't do that.

00:20:46.935 --> 00:20:48.554
Uh, but you can definitely
do this on your own.

00:20:48.554 --> 00:20:51.375
You'll see God fulfilling each
one of those promises, right?

00:20:51.945 --> 00:20:54.524
But before he could fi those
promises, you'll see in here he

00:20:54.524 --> 00:20:56.504
says to be strong and courageous.

00:20:57.105 --> 00:21:00.105
And, um, just, just so you, you
think through this a little bit.

00:21:02.774 --> 00:21:05.655
Someone once said this and I, I, I
really thought this was really good.

00:21:05.955 --> 00:21:09.855
God's promises are prods, not pillows.

00:21:11.085 --> 00:21:11.385
Me.

00:21:11.445 --> 00:21:12.014
Lemme say that again.

00:21:12.014 --> 00:21:15.585
God's promises are prods, not pillows.

00:21:15.975 --> 00:21:16.575
What's a prod?

00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:17.655
Anybody know what a prod is?

00:21:18.764 --> 00:21:20.865
You poke like, usually a
lot of times it's animals.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.745
Get them move, you know, moved
down the gate or wherever.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:24.845
If you've ever had any of that.

00:21:24.845 --> 00:21:26.565
If not, um, look it up.

00:21:26.774 --> 00:21:28.635
But think about this.

00:21:28.845 --> 00:21:30.284
God's promises isn't for us.

00:21:30.899 --> 00:21:35.970
Just sit and wait until he fulfills
him the really encouragements to go.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:40.050
So I, I, I, I've used some examples
before, but think about this.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.520
If you knew tomorrow, whatever
you felt like God was calling

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.649
you to do, go start a nonprofit.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.530
Go quit your job and
be a stay-at-home mom.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.120
Move to a foreign country.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.210
Go talk to a neighbor and chair
the gospel with whatever it is.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.120
If you knew you would be
successful 100% of the time, would.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.860
I may have not hit wherever
you're at, but would you go

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.420
and most of us say Absolutely.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.130
I would go because it was guaranteed.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.140
Let me take a step back here.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:13.200
God's promises are not pillows to
rest on, but prods to go after.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.830
Many of us are missing out on God's
promises and what he has for us because

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:22.800
we are waiting rather than going in faith.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.890
Just like Joshua, they would've
never experienced the promised.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.880
. And one of the stories we won't even get
to is the priests that were carrying the

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.770
arc in order for the water to part, in
order to go across the Jordan, all of the

00:22:34.775 --> 00:22:38.490
priests feet had to be in the water before
it would part or naturally not part, but

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.340
it would go up, up, up, short or up river.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:46.530
Um, and when you think about that picture,
this was during the flood season, that

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.950
water was not trickling and it was easy to
just jump in and yeah, it's gonna recede.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:51.210
No, it was pouring.

00:22:51.215 --> 00:22:54.660
And they had to in faith, step
in and in moment that they.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.280
It was dry ground.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.490
And I always share this picture that
dry ground was not muddy ground.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.290
That, you know, if water
receded, it would be muddy.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.670
It was dry as dust.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.160
I believe it because that's what God does.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.300
That's what God does.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.150
And these are the cool things when
we think about the encouragement

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.660
that Joshua would get to, to rely
on his promises and what we can

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.760
get and rely on God's promises.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.580
And these are things that I
know I've experienced in my

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.930
life over and over again.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.820
Many of you have probably
experienced in your life as.

00:23:22.004 --> 00:23:23.145
I'll just give you one example.

00:23:23.145 --> 00:23:26.955
I remember whenever me and my wife,
we had just started attending church

00:23:26.955 --> 00:23:28.695
and the church was 45 minutes away.

00:23:29.115 --> 00:23:33.705
Um, and I was new, new to my faith,
and we were getting involved and

00:23:33.705 --> 00:23:37.575
we had this sense we needed to
move closer to our church, but we

00:23:37.575 --> 00:23:38.565
didn't know how we were gonna do it.

00:23:38.655 --> 00:23:40.395
We had no clue how we were
gonna do it, but we needed

00:23:40.395 --> 00:23:41.325
to move closer to our church.

00:23:41.685 --> 00:23:43.514
So we are like, okay, we're
gonna start looking for homes.

00:23:43.514 --> 00:23:44.835
So we start looking for
homes closer to the.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:49.800
And we found some that were
almost two times the amount of

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.840
our current house and were like,
there's no way we could afford it.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.480
Well come to figure out the cool
part cuz at that time, not what

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.320
we're dealing with right now.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:59.880
The house we were in had such a high
interest rate and all the newer houses

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:04.500
had a lot lower interest rate, lower
insurance rates, um, everything was lower.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.610
We actually found out that we could
pay less to live in the house.

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:09.540
That we could live near the.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.000
Than the one we were
living 45 minutes away.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.210
So we sold that house and we moved
into that house and that was part of

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:18.720
us getting involved in the church and
part of God's transforming power to call

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.890
us to ministry and all these things.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:20.220
Right?

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:23.940
And I think of those things where God
provided, we really had this sense that,

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.680
God, but that would've been crazy, right?

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.180
To, to move closer to the church.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.380
That's the only reason
why you're gonna move us.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.040
Move closer to your church.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.540
God did something through that.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.120
And I just think, what if we didn't do it?

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.620
What if we said no, we're just gonna
wait And, and I don't know where I'd be.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.700
Maybe I'd still be in that same.

00:24:39.885 --> 00:24:41.445
God's doing this over and over again.

00:24:41.445 --> 00:24:44.804
God encourages us as we
fulfill his mission right by

00:24:44.804 --> 00:24:46.575
reminding us of his promises.

00:24:47.415 --> 00:24:49.455
God's commission encourages us.

00:24:49.605 --> 00:24:51.225
God's promise encourages us.

00:24:51.225 --> 00:24:52.725
And here's one of the
things I wanna hang out on.

00:24:53.085 --> 00:24:54.495
God, excuse me, not God.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.195
Joshua received encouragement
from God's written word, right?

00:24:59.595 --> 00:25:01.095
Let's look at this, verse seven.

00:25:02.085 --> 00:25:03.525
Above all, and this is why I love it.

00:25:03.525 --> 00:25:05.235
Again, he's walking through
these nine verses and then

00:25:05.235 --> 00:25:07.035
he uses this word above all.

00:25:07.035 --> 00:25:09.945
So to me it's like, say all
these other things are great,

00:25:10.785 --> 00:25:12.225
but let's lean in right here.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:13.725
This is God speaking to Joshua.

00:25:13.905 --> 00:25:17.415
Above all, be strong and
very courageous to observe

00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:18.855
carefully the whole instruction.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.475
My servant Moses community.

00:25:20.895 --> 00:25:23.325
Do not turn from it to the
right or to the left so that you

00:25:23.325 --> 00:25:25.395
have success wherever you go.

00:25:25.845 --> 00:25:28.875
This book of instruction must
not depart from your mouth.

00:25:28.875 --> 00:25:30.375
You are to meditate on it day and.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.800
So that you may be carefully able
to observe everything written

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.100
in it for then you will prosper
and succeed in whatever you do.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.300
You may look at this and we'll see
these two things where he says that

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.450
you'll be successful and you'll
be prosperous wherever you go.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.639
No, I'm not preaching
the prosperity gospel.

00:25:47.645 --> 00:25:51.899
You know what I, I'm preaching
the promised Gospel prosperity,

00:25:51.899 --> 00:25:54.750
gospel promises, always
health, wealth, and prosperity.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.399
No matter what you do, as long as.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:58.410
Do things for the Lord.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.040
What I would say is the promise Gospel
promises that God will fulfill his

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.590
mission through you, and you'll be
a part of building his kingdom and

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:10.080
experiencing the kingdom of God now and
forever if you fall after his promises.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:14.490
See, you may be missing that, but
I, I look at this, and I love this.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:18.630
If we prioritize the word of God, which
means we know more about God and we begin

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:24.810
to apply the word of God in faith, we will
experience success, we will prosper and.

00:26:26.145 --> 00:26:30.375
What we think of succeeding may be
Paul in a prison, but Paul believed he

00:26:30.375 --> 00:26:32.834
succeeded because he even said this,
and I don't remember what book it is.

00:26:32.834 --> 00:26:36.584
He says this, I actually am happy that I'm
in prison because it seems like that the

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:41.925
gospel is spreading more, which means he's
successful even though he's in prison.

00:26:42.104 --> 00:26:45.344
See, our definition of success
is different than the world's,

00:26:45.945 --> 00:26:47.475
and I think that's the hard part.

00:26:47.475 --> 00:26:50.895
For most of us, our success
is different than the worlds.

00:26:51.465 --> 00:26:53.115
But he says this, and I
think it's so important.

00:26:53.115 --> 00:26:54.975
He says, be strong and very courage.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:59.910
And whenever I think about that being
strong and very courageous, he's talking

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:05.310
about being strong and very courageous
to remember the word, not just in going

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.040
out in faith, but in studying the word.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:14.790
So we go back to the priority of the word
as if you wanna prioritize the word of

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:19.170
God in your life and see transformation,
it's going to take being strong and

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.470
very courageous, which means this,
you're gonna have to consistently.

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.600
The distractions.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:28.260
You're gonna have to consistently
fight all the to-do lists and all

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.110
the other things that you have
prioritized before the word of God.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.700
In order to get into the word of God.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.710
It's not going to be easy.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.700
That's why he said this.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.010
He's not just saying, going in
faith, be strong and very courageous.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.640
He's saying to prioritize the word,
you're going to have to be strong

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.350
and courageous, which means this.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.280
It's gonna take more
than just, uh, I should.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.930
It's gonna be, I need to because
it's going to transform my life.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.350
I need it as much as I need sleep,
I need it as much as I need food, I

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.120
need it as much as I need anything.

00:27:57.125 --> 00:27:57.360
Right?

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.940
So Joshua's strength encouraged though,
would come from the word of God.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.150
So the more that you're in the word,
the more that you are strengthened and

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.560
encouraged to get back in the word.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.200
So go back to that idea
of sleeping and eating.

00:28:11.415 --> 00:28:13.500
. It nourishes us when we sleep and eat.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.700
It refreshes us.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:20.730
The word of God nourishes us, empowers us,
and gives us a strength to go fulfill and

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:24.000
proclaim and experience God's promises.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.070
So he says this, what does meditate mean?

00:28:26.075 --> 00:28:26.310
Right?

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.090
Most of us probably know the little, Hmm.

00:28:29.429 --> 00:28:30.090
You know, you could do that.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:30.990
That's that's great.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:31.800
And that's part of it.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:36.149
But if we think about meditation,
it's to think deeply on or focus

00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:37.530
one's mind for a period of.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:44.280
And I love this in silence or with
aid of repeating, you'll, you'll

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.960
catch me sometimes talking to myself.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.030
And it's not because I'm
just weird cuz that's true.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.780
But a lot of times I'm repeating
God's word over my life.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.640
So just trying to be a
little bit transparent.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.850
I didn't sleep well at all
last night, like a, at all.

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:57.570
I don't know why.

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:01.020
I think maybe the enemy was just trying to
do something just like, I mean I, it was

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:06.450
bad and I just kept repeating God's word
over my life that he has something for.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.620
Me today.

00:29:07.649 --> 00:29:10.200
For you today, there's a
reason why we need to be here.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.930
And then I opened up my garage, didn't
even realize it snowed as much as it did.

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:15.030
And I'm like, okay, Lord, are you sure?

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:16.230
I, I mean, I don't have much rest.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.040
And there's snow on the ground.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.570
And he's like, no, there's something here
for each one of us and we're all here.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.930
And so I'm just, I'm leaning
in a little bit and going,

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.430
okay, God's doing something.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:30.000
But the only way that I could
remember that is by repeating and

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.180
meditating on God's word to remind
me that God is doing something.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.750
So when we think about meditating in
God's word, it's to, to read it daily,

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.460
to think on it daily to repeat it.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.600
And I love this part to make
it part of the inner person.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.530
It.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.410
If you ever read something and then
you're like, I gotta reread that page,

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:47.850
cuz I didn't even consume it at all.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:52.950
To make it in the inner person is
to actually consume it, to eat it.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.170
And then it becomes a part of you.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.960
And if it's a part of you, which
means then as you go out throughout

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.410
your day, you remember it because
you have it with you, right?

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:02.070
You have it with.

00:30:03.645 --> 00:30:07.695
Um, just to kind of even think about
this, uh, Warren Weby said this.

00:30:07.695 --> 00:30:10.875
He says, if you don't talk to your
Bible, your Bible won't talk to you.

00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:12.825
And you may think that's kind
of funny, but it's those moments

00:30:12.825 --> 00:30:15.405
where you're reading and sometimes
you have to kind of talk it out.

00:30:15.735 --> 00:30:16.725
You have to think about it.

00:30:16.785 --> 00:30:17.115
Right.

00:30:17.715 --> 00:30:20.505
Um, and I, I think it's,
it's so important here.

00:30:20.505 --> 00:30:22.695
So at the end of verses seven
A, again, he talks about this

00:30:22.965 --> 00:30:25.905
prosperity or this a success, right?

00:30:25.905 --> 00:30:29.565
And these blessings are a byproduct
of the devotion to the word of.

00:30:31.034 --> 00:30:33.435
Again, success is different in the world.

00:30:33.794 --> 00:30:37.155
And, um, I, I believe success
is defined by obedience.

00:30:37.514 --> 00:30:37.935
Right?

00:30:37.995 --> 00:30:39.905
And out of that obedience comes blessing.

00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:40.995
And so, lemme give you another quote.

00:30:40.995 --> 00:30:43.004
I love different quotes here,
but Johnny Hunt said this.

00:30:43.245 --> 00:30:48.375
He said, make earth your aim and
you'll maybe get it, make heaven your

00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:50.564
aim, and you'll get earth thrown in.

00:30:50.834 --> 00:30:53.475
It's that idea behind a lot of the
things that we do in life is to.

00:30:54.659 --> 00:30:57.090
Experience a worldly kingdom, right?

00:30:57.149 --> 00:30:59.760
And if you're anything like me, we're
looking under retirement accounts and

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.439
wondering, are we ever gonna make it?

00:31:01.439 --> 00:31:02.219
Are we ever gonna retire?

00:31:02.225 --> 00:31:02.550
Right?

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.159
Um, but the idea is we're,
we're thinking about that.

00:31:05.159 --> 00:31:07.139
We're thinking about our health, we're
thinking about our kids' activities.

00:31:07.139 --> 00:31:09.149
I have four kids and I
totally get it right.

00:31:09.419 --> 00:31:12.149
We're thinking about every single thing
else, and we're prioritizing that.

00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:17.160
Whenever we look at this and we say,
oh, Success is really defined by

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.030
following Jesus first, and all those
things come through that, right?

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.380
Then I look at my kids' activities.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.740
I look at everything else that I
do in my life and it flows through

00:31:25.745 --> 00:31:28.800
that if we'll seek first the kingdom
of God, he says in Matthew six

00:31:28.805 --> 00:31:30.660
that he will provide what we need.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.320
So speaking of blessing, success, right?

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.960
Joshua had a choice to
fulfill his purpose.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.190
God had given him.

00:31:39.615 --> 00:31:40.425
Command.

00:31:40.695 --> 00:31:43.185
He was encouraging him
through the promises.

00:31:43.395 --> 00:31:47.535
He was reminding him and encouraging him
through the word and prioritizing that.

00:31:48.345 --> 00:31:54.735
But Joshua had to say, yes,
Joshua had to go and do, and

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.685
God, he had to follow through.

00:31:56.715 --> 00:32:00.315
Cuz again, we can read the word of
God every day, but if we don't take

00:32:00.315 --> 00:32:02.415
it and apply it, um, it's worthless.

00:32:02.415 --> 00:32:04.125
And I, I, again, there's
another quote from Johnny Hunt.

00:32:04.125 --> 00:32:06.014
He said this, he says, we can study God's.

00:32:07.155 --> 00:32:11.385
for years and years and years, but one
step or one act of obedience is worth

00:32:11.385 --> 00:32:12.975
more than years of studying about it.

00:32:13.395 --> 00:32:13.995
I'll say that again.

00:32:14.145 --> 00:32:18.465
We can study God's word for years
and years and years, but one step or

00:32:18.465 --> 00:32:21.795
one act of obedience is more worth
more than years of studying about it.

00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:22.905
That challenged me.

00:32:22.905 --> 00:32:24.105
I, I'm to this day.

00:32:24.105 --> 00:32:25.515
I can remember when I heard that quote.

00:32:25.665 --> 00:32:30.375
I was moaning in my backyard nine years
ago, and that just, I stopped and I

00:32:30.375 --> 00:32:33.735
wrote it down, and that just challenged
me because I wanna be a faith doer.

00:32:33.735 --> 00:32:35.235
I wanna follow after God.

00:32:35.235 --> 00:32:35.905
I don't just want.

00:32:36.465 --> 00:32:38.925
I want to experience God and I
wanna experience his promises.

00:32:38.925 --> 00:32:42.195
So going back to this again,
Joshua had to fill his promise.

00:32:43.004 --> 00:32:46.125
So let me just, as we're kind
of heading towards the end

00:32:46.125 --> 00:32:47.235
here, I'm trying to get there.

00:32:48.075 --> 00:32:51.855
If you're here today, if you're
online, do you really want to

00:32:51.855 --> 00:32:53.115
fill God's purpose in your life?

00:32:53.355 --> 00:32:57.855
Do you, do you wanna, whatever your
divine purpose is, why you were created?

00:32:57.855 --> 00:32:58.545
Do you wanna fulfill it?

00:32:58.545 --> 00:33:00.765
Do you wanna discover what that is
and go out and live with anybody?

00:33:01.275 --> 00:33:02.145
Okay, some of you do.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.275
Some of you may be question.

00:33:05.045 --> 00:33:07.335
. But I would say this, it starts
with prioritizing God's word.

00:33:08.235 --> 00:33:09.285
And I wanna challenge you with this.

00:33:09.425 --> 00:33:12.165
I, I don't know, I think we had this up
here, uh, something that I've been meaning

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:14.865
to send out to our, all of our church,
but we have the read scripture app.

00:33:15.225 --> 00:33:17.745
Um, the Read scripture app is something
that I'm walking through this year.

00:33:17.745 --> 00:33:18.235
I love it.

00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:22.815
Um, it is giving you videos to watch, to
kind of set up each chapter of the Bible.

00:33:22.815 --> 00:33:25.725
It's a, it's walking you
through the whole Bible as well.

00:33:25.965 --> 00:33:29.295
But I believe this, and I, I said this
a couple weeks ago in our Vision Sunday,

00:33:29.625 --> 00:33:31.425
if you will prioritize the word of.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.035
, everything else will fall into line.

00:33:34.305 --> 00:33:35.385
And what do I mean by fall into line?

00:33:35.475 --> 00:33:37.095
You'll discover God's
purpose for your life.

00:33:37.155 --> 00:33:38.265
You'll fulfill your call.

00:33:38.475 --> 00:33:39.975
You'll do what you need to do.

00:33:39.975 --> 00:33:42.105
If you'll prioritize the
word of God, guarantee this.

00:33:42.615 --> 00:33:43.335
I've seen it in my life.

00:33:43.335 --> 00:33:43.995
I've seen it in other people's life.

00:33:44.025 --> 00:33:46.905
If you'll do that, we don't
have to worry about the rest.

00:33:46.905 --> 00:33:47.565
And what do I mean by that?

00:33:47.565 --> 00:33:50.175
We'll, we'll be challenging you
to take other steps, but the

00:33:50.175 --> 00:33:53.115
word of God will prompt you and
we'll help you fulfill that.

00:33:53.565 --> 00:33:55.365
And as a church, I wanna
continue to say this.

00:33:55.455 --> 00:33:58.665
If you need something to guide you on
where to read, do the Read scripture app.

00:33:58.665 --> 00:33:59.655
That's what I'm doing this year.

00:33:59.985 --> 00:34:01.135
It is encouraging.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.470
, but I know this, that you
may ask, what do I gain?

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.510
If I read the word of
God, what will you gain?

00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:09.270
I, I can't probably give you
that to a T, but I can tell you

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.560
a couple things that you'll lose.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:12.179
Here's what you'll lose.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:18.870
Anger, jealousy, selfishness, greed,
envy, lust when you're in the word

00:34:18.875 --> 00:34:22.469
of God and it reminds you of what
God has done for you, what God

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:25.049
has forgiven you of, and if you're
struggling with any of those things,

00:34:25.049 --> 00:34:26.909
this isn't a guaranteed gone forever.

00:34:27.564 --> 00:34:29.609
. This is means we need to continue
being the word of God so that it

00:34:29.609 --> 00:34:30.779
helps us overcome these things.

00:34:31.049 --> 00:34:33.120
So those are some of the things that
you'll lose, but I'll, I'll let's

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.489
just use the fruits of the spirit
that what God will give you to

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:37.199
replace that, because I believe this.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:38.730
It's not about saying no to sin.

00:34:38.734 --> 00:34:40.169
It's about saying yes to Jesus.

00:34:40.529 --> 00:34:44.339
Because if we say yes to Jesus, sin tends
typically goes to the back, and we begin

00:34:44.344 --> 00:34:46.199
to prioritize what God gives us, right?

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:49.830
He gives us the fruit of the spirit,
love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:52.560
generosity, gentleness, and self-control.

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:56.370
I love when the spirit of.

00:34:57.495 --> 00:35:00.885
Through the word of God
empowers me to live for God.

00:35:01.545 --> 00:35:02.145
I love it.

00:35:02.235 --> 00:35:05.775
I love seeing what God does and, and it
seems like when I'm in the word of God, I

00:35:05.775 --> 00:35:10.995
tend to do more in a way that honors God
and gives me fulfillment for my purpose.

00:35:10.995 --> 00:35:12.165
Let me just give you a couple examples.

00:35:12.345 --> 00:35:12.795
I coach.

00:35:13.425 --> 00:35:17.175
It's not technically CrossFit, but
I coach, uh, at a gym here locally.

00:35:17.475 --> 00:35:20.445
And, uh, one of the things when I go
in there, I typically ask God, who is

00:35:20.445 --> 00:35:21.615
it here that needs to be encouraged?

00:35:21.615 --> 00:35:24.765
And I'm usually looking for the person
that's standing by themselves that's

00:35:24.765 --> 00:35:27.945
less confident, and I basically begin
to speak life in them, encouraging

00:35:27.945 --> 00:35:30.915
where the them, where they're at to
try to build them up where they are.

00:35:31.185 --> 00:35:33.285
God just has done something
to my heart to remember that.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:34.890
, but also the other day.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:35.669
This is really challenging.

00:35:35.669 --> 00:35:36.569
This isn't a pat on my back.

00:35:36.569 --> 00:35:40.000
This is the spirit of God working
through the word of God to transform

00:35:40.004 --> 00:35:41.700
and use me for his purposes.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.490
I'm driving home from a
meeting, driving home.

00:35:44.495 --> 00:35:46.859
I'm, I'm, I'm tired, I'm ready to go home.

00:35:47.189 --> 00:35:49.200
And the Lord said, you need
to stop by this school.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:54.020
Go in and tell this one person in
the school that you love him, that

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.460
you believe in them and give 'em.

00:35:55.975 --> 00:35:57.705
And I'm like, ah, I don't
really wanna do that.

00:35:57.705 --> 00:35:58.964
I didn't call and tell 'em I'm gonna come.

00:35:59.055 --> 00:36:00.314
So we're really in the schools.

00:36:00.314 --> 00:36:02.145
We're involved in the schools
doing a lot of different things.

00:36:02.325 --> 00:36:02.895
So you know what?

00:36:02.895 --> 00:36:07.185
I turned left, went out of the way, went
to the school, buzzed in, they said, who?

00:36:07.214 --> 00:36:07.754
Who is this?

00:36:07.754 --> 00:36:09.105
I told 'em, Hey, it's
pastor man coming in.

00:36:09.285 --> 00:36:09.884
Okay, great.

00:36:09.884 --> 00:36:12.435
So I walked in, found the
person, said, I believe in you.

00:36:13.245 --> 00:36:13.754
I love you.

00:36:13.935 --> 00:36:16.725
And I gave him a hug and
that person needed it.

00:36:17.055 --> 00:36:19.455
They said, oh my gosh, like
you chose a perfect day.

00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.105
And it's those moments where it's
like, what if I didn't show up?

00:36:24.345 --> 00:36:28.095
What if I just said, And again, this,
it's, it's, I, I'm just going back

00:36:28.095 --> 00:36:33.254
to the word of God was so inside of
my life that as I'm beginning to live

00:36:33.254 --> 00:36:38.355
out my life, rather than to choose
self, I chose to fulfill my calling.

00:36:38.355 --> 00:36:40.140
I believe one of my callings
in life is to be an encourager.

00:36:40.575 --> 00:36:42.855
I love to encourage and believe in people.

00:36:43.754 --> 00:36:44.564
So what is it for you?

00:36:44.564 --> 00:36:46.634
What is it that God is calling you to do?

00:36:47.115 --> 00:36:51.225
What is it that you need
to to begin to prioritize?

00:36:51.225 --> 00:36:51.435
Right?

00:36:51.435 --> 00:36:52.085
The word of.

00:36:52.875 --> 00:36:56.235
But how do we do it in a way that
is fulfilling, not where it's like,

00:36:56.235 --> 00:36:57.345
oh, this is what I have to do.

00:36:58.305 --> 00:37:00.315
I, I'll just give you this last one
cause I wanna make sure we hit this

00:37:00.315 --> 00:37:03.375
point in verse nine, Joshua will
receive also encouragement from the

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:07.455
commandments of God, and he says this
in verse nine, haven't I commanded you?

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.805
Be strong and courageous?

00:37:08.865 --> 00:37:11.985
Do not be afraid or discouraged
for the Lord your God is with you.

00:37:12.385 --> 00:37:15.045
Wherever you go, you will know why.

00:37:15.045 --> 00:37:18.555
I think that a lot of times we don't
fulfill our callings in life is because

00:37:18.555 --> 00:37:20.865
we lack the strength and courage.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:25.635
because we're discouraged and afraid
and because we're afraid that God

00:37:25.635 --> 00:37:26.895
may not be there wherever we go.

00:37:28.635 --> 00:37:29.245
I, I, I.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:34.155
And why did God say be strong and
courageous three times in nine verses?

00:37:35.775 --> 00:37:36.825
Because he understood.

00:37:36.825 --> 00:37:38.145
We need to be reminded.

00:37:39.135 --> 00:37:40.935
And so I challenge you
with this statement.

00:37:41.595 --> 00:37:42.675
Whatever we think on, right?

00:37:42.795 --> 00:37:47.265
Whatever we think on, we believe
so sometimes we just need to.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:49.380
Over and over again.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.430
Be strong and courageous.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.680
Be strong and courageous to
get into the word of God.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:56.370
And as you're strong and courageous
to get in the word of God, God will

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:59.970
get you rid of that discouragement
and that things that you're afraid

00:37:59.975 --> 00:38:02.640
of, and he'll remind you that
he'll be with you wherever you go.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:07.620
So God's commandments are God's
enablements to obey him in faith.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.660
Just loving, loving this.

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:13.650
This idea of the, uh, in Luke
1 37, the angel said to Mary,

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.070
for with God nothing is Im.

00:38:17.355 --> 00:38:21.345
See that story of, of Jesus' birth
is, is something that would seem

00:38:21.345 --> 00:38:22.965
impossible, but even God could do that.

00:38:23.925 --> 00:38:25.365
The word of God is powerful.

00:38:26.205 --> 00:38:29.775
And anytime Joshua would be tempted or
afraid to lead these people into the

00:38:30.165 --> 00:38:35.055
promised land, he could remember what
God said, be strong and courageous.

00:38:35.865 --> 00:38:39.525
He could remember God's defined
commission that he sent him on, that

00:38:39.525 --> 00:38:41.205
his presence would be be with him.

00:38:41.895 --> 00:38:43.995
So for you, I, I don't
know what you need today.

00:38:43.995 --> 00:38:45.675
I don't know what encouragement you.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.565
, but, but can I say this?

00:38:47.565 --> 00:38:49.875
If you'll take one thing, because
I said a lot today, if you'll take

00:38:49.875 --> 00:38:53.145
one thing, prioritizing the word of
God should not be something that you

00:38:53.145 --> 00:38:54.555
feel guilty cuz you're not doing.

00:38:55.065 --> 00:38:58.305
It should be something as an
opportunity, just like an opportunity

00:38:58.305 --> 00:39:00.435
to go eat when we're done here
cuz I'm excited about that.

00:39:00.435 --> 00:39:01.635
So let's take my boys to Mexican.

00:39:02.145 --> 00:39:03.405
I love some Mexican, right?

00:39:03.555 --> 00:39:05.445
I'm excited to go do that now.

00:39:05.475 --> 00:39:06.285
Seriously, I am.

00:39:07.035 --> 00:39:11.475
But I also should be excited about
getting the word of God because

00:39:11.475 --> 00:39:13.436
I know that it will transform my.

00:39:14.865 --> 00:39:18.555
When you think about this again, new year,
when you look back from a year now, from

00:39:18.555 --> 00:39:23.925
now, like 20, 24, January, do you want
to be in the same place you are today?

00:39:26.265 --> 00:39:27.225
I mean, maybe you do.

00:39:27.855 --> 00:39:28.335
I don't.

00:39:28.395 --> 00:39:29.115
I wanna grow.

00:39:29.355 --> 00:39:30.405
I wanna know Jesus more.

00:39:30.645 --> 00:39:32.145
I wanna experience his transforming life.

00:39:32.145 --> 00:39:33.495
I wanna proclaim his promises.

00:39:33.495 --> 00:39:36.825
I wanna experience his
promises, and I pray you do too.

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:40.005
God didn't save you to stay where you are.

00:39:40.185 --> 00:39:40.815
He saved.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:46.950
For a purpose, just like Joshua's
purpose, to go out and live, inspired

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.510
to be changed, to be different.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.560
So God's word is for us to
be strong and courageous.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.770
Let's prioritize the word this week.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.960
Let's prioritize the word every day.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.460
And if you need encouragement,
if you need direction, this

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:03.900
isn't me just saying go do it.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.700
This is me saying reach out.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.200
I may not know Everyth.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.450
So I may be like, Hey
Amanda, what are you doing?

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:10.530
I may say, Hey Matt, what are you doing?

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:11.610
I may say, Laura, what are you doing?

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:15.480
Let's work together to help each
other get into the word of God.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.570
We are the body of Christ, but
this means that we don't just

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:20.250
say, Hey, go do and walk away.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:21.480
We are a family.

00:40:21.485 --> 00:40:22.950
Let's do this together.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:24.390
So let me help.

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:26.490
Let somebody else help
and walk alongside you.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:27.900
So let's pray.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:30.330
So, Lord Jesus, we thank you so much.

00:40:31.305 --> 00:40:35.714
That you've given this opportunity to
be here today to open up your word for

00:40:35.714 --> 00:40:39.285
those who are online, to be able to meet
online, to be able to hear this message.

00:40:39.285 --> 00:40:43.545
Lord, um, I pray that you are honored
in everything that is said and done.

00:40:44.174 --> 00:40:48.464
And Lord, I just pray that you give us
encouragement, just like you gave Joshua.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:52.455
Lord, I pray that you give us
encouragement in your commission,

00:40:53.565 --> 00:40:58.935
Lord, in your promises, in your
word, in your commandments.

00:40:58.935 --> 00:40:59.685
I pray that you give.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:04.770
A lot of encouragement, Lord, because I
know each one of us needs to be strong

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:07.830
and courageous as we dive into your
word and prioritize it in our lives.

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:11.490
Lord, help us Lord not
look at the word of God.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:14.280
Um, Lord, like we look
at eating vegetables.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.590
Oh, that's what I should do, Lord.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:20.490
I pray that we look at the word of God
and we see something that is beautiful,

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:26.340
something that can fill us and nourish
us and empower us to fulfill our purpose.

00:41:26.345 --> 00:41:26.790
This side of.

00:41:28.049 --> 00:41:32.609
Lord Jesus, we want to see transformation
in this church, in this city, in

00:41:32.609 --> 00:41:36.270
the Y M C A and around our lives.

00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:41.160
But Lord, I know that there are people
in this room, Lord, that may not know

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.640
you, Lord, that they're hearing this idea
behind prioritizing the word of God, Lord.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:46.950
And I pray if there's someone
in this room, Lord, that doesn't

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.069
know you, that today, that they
will give their lives to you in.

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:54.270
Lord, that they'll pray and ask
for forgiveness of their sins, and

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:59.279
they'll pray for you to come into
their lives, transform them, meet with

00:41:59.279 --> 00:42:01.799
them, and spend eternity with them.

00:42:01.805 --> 00:42:03.660
Lord, Lord, I pray that again.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.790
If there's someone in this room that
needs to give their lives to you,

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:09.270
Lord, that whenever I get done praying,
Lord, and I'm standing in the back of

00:42:09.274 --> 00:42:11.910
the, the service, Lord, I pray that
they get up and they come and they

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:13.470
find me and they say, Hey, will you?

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.220
Me Lord, I pray If there's a person
in this room or that's struggling to

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.520
prioritize the word of God or struggling
in their lives and they need prayer, Lord

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.400
I pray that they'll come find me or find
someone else to ask to pray for them.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:27.270
Lord, we believe in prayer because
we are a prayer founded church.

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:28.740
We are here because you.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:34.140
Have used the many people in this city
and around the world, Lord, to pray for

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.700
a church to be planted here in Hamilton.

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:41.100
And we accepted that call each one of us
that is here today and has joined this

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:45.420
church, Lord has accepted that call to
be a part of building your kingdom here.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.140
Lord, we were built on prayer and
we are founded on prayer, Lord.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:53.340
And we want to con, continue to pray for
lives to be transformed in this service

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.160
today and in the services to come.

00:42:57.435 --> 00:43:00.555
So God lead us and guide us
and transform our hearts.

00:43:01.695 --> 00:43:02.745
We pray this in your heaven name.

00:43:03.585 --> 00:43:03.915
Amen.

00:43:05.355 --> 00:43:08.325
So I just wanted you guys to take some
time during this invitation, during the

00:43:08.415 --> 00:43:12.345
time that they're seen to reflect and
ask the Lord to give you some wisdom

00:43:12.375 --> 00:43:13.875
on how to prioritize the word of God.

00:43:14.505 --> 00:43:16.845
And if you do have questions
about giving your life to Jesus,

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.165
again, I'm gonna be in the back.

00:43:18.255 --> 00:43:19.575
I would love to be able to talk with you.

00:43:20.385 --> 00:43:22.095
So let's, let's take some time to do that.
