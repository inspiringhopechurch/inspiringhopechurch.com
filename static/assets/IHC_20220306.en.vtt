00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.190
Well, it is great to be back.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.140
Um, I know last week was our surf Sunday.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.710
We had such a good Sunday being
able to serve our community and,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.780
um, be able to watch some kiddos.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.680
Um, I know our kiddos enjoyed it
as well, and I'm excited to be back

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.770
this week to continue our series
and the book of first Timothy.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.670
So if you have your Bible with you,
um, go to first Timothy chapter one.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.630
Um, we're going to be in
chapter two and we're going to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.800
cover the rest of the verses.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.720
So we read two weeks ago verses one
through seven in chapter two of Timothy,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.430
but we only covered really the first two.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.200
And I'd say I kind of covered the
third verse, but we're going to

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.530
come back and cover the third verse
all the way down to verse seven.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.970
And we started with two weeks
ago of the priority of prayer.

00:00:50.894 --> 00:00:51.615
Part one.

00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:54.975
So there's a part two today, and it's
going to be interesting as we begin to

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:57.585
pull this together, we're going to talk
about the priority of prayer on the front

00:00:57.585 --> 00:01:00.185
end and the back end to kind of bring this
together of what we're talking about that,

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:06.315
but there's so much good, um, things to
talk about today, then I'm hoping, um, we

00:01:06.315 --> 00:01:10.695
can dive into in each one of us will walk
away, just changed and challenged by this.

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:13.125
And so again, we picked up two
weeks ago where we talked about

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.705
this idea, whatever we prioritize.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.010
Shows us what we believe is
most important, our life,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.450
whatever we prioritize.

00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:25.395
Shows us what's most
important in our lives.

00:01:25.395 --> 00:01:27.315
And if you want to know,
what do you prioritize?

00:01:27.705 --> 00:01:29.085
You need to check at least two things.

00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:31.485
Number one, your bank account,
number two, your calendar.

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:34.725
And if you don't have a calendar,
then basically whatever you do.

00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:35.235
Right.

00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:37.545
Um, but those are two things you'll
begin to realize your priorities

00:01:37.545 --> 00:01:41.055
and family you're prioritizing work
or your kids' activities, or, you

00:01:41.055 --> 00:01:44.265
know, you name it or your Amazon
habit, whatever it is that you press.

00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:49.554
Becomes the what's most important
in your life, what we tend to find.

00:01:49.645 --> 00:01:51.925
And so, you know, I'm the one
that struggles with this as well.

00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:56.755
What we tend to find is prayer
is not on their prayers, usually

00:01:56.755 --> 00:01:58.285
a low priority in our lives.

00:01:58.525 --> 00:02:01.945
It's a response to all
the other priorities.

00:02:01.975 --> 00:02:03.054
So let me give you an example.

00:02:03.054 --> 00:02:05.335
If I'm having financial problems, I pray.

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:08.695
If I'm having car troubles, I
pray I'm having work struggles.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:09.475
I pray.

00:02:09.805 --> 00:02:15.015
So as the result of my priority, Prayer
becomes the priority of a necessity

00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:17.775
rather than a need or on the front end.

00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:22.335
So what we've been really trying to
change, or our thinking on is over

00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:25.785
the last couple weeks is this idea
behind why should we prioritize prayer?

00:02:25.785 --> 00:02:28.185
What is valuable about it?

00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:31.875
Um, and, and I think through this,
this idea, and I'm want to continue

00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:32.835
to challenge each one of us.

00:02:34.035 --> 00:02:39.345
Through church, prayer, our time
with God in this way that it's not

00:02:39.345 --> 00:02:43.215
something we have to do or something
we should do, but it's something

00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:45.975
we see that is valuable to us.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:49.665
So we don't pray because we have to,
but because it's valuable in our lives.

00:02:49.965 --> 00:02:51.075
And here's an example for you.

00:02:51.075 --> 00:02:53.985
This is something that I've been applying
over the last year, approximately the

00:02:53.985 --> 00:02:57.915
last year, I've really been trying to
prioritize three things, quality sleep.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.190
Quality food and exercise.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.540
Here's the reason why there was a
time where my mental, physical and

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.280
psychological state was struggling.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.450
I was just imbalanced.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.890
I was just not sleeping well.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.410
I was always hungry and
moody and it seemed like.

00:03:14.055 --> 00:03:17.625
Um, I just was struggling spiritually
and I just, and I realized these

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:18.675
are three areas I needed to get.

00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:19.175
Right.

00:03:19.275 --> 00:03:20.085
Am I perfect with them?

00:03:20.085 --> 00:03:25.125
No, but as I begin to prioritize
them, the end result produce positive

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:27.855
results, mentally, physically,
and spiritually in my life.

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:32.475
Well, I'll I'll how did I even figure
out if that worked one, I had to begin

00:03:32.475 --> 00:03:35.835
to prioritize those things, to see
if it worked and it became valuable

00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:37.005
to me that I want to repeat it.

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:38.265
So let's apply this to.

00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:43.965
If we think, okay, well, prayer, you
know, prioritize in prayer can be

00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:48.345
valuable to me, but we never attempt to
prioritize it, to see if it's valuable.

00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:49.635
It becomes this.

00:03:49.695 --> 00:03:50.745
Oh, I should.

00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:53.565
Or I ought to, or because I'm
a Christian or because I go to

00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:56.955
church, I should do these things
and we never really experienced it.

00:03:57.315 --> 00:04:01.155
Well, my challenge for you today
is to test the Lord in this is

00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:04.605
to take prayer and say, how do
I begin to prioritize it first?

00:04:04.695 --> 00:04:06.105
Because that's what Paul
talks about in this text.

00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:07.335
First of all, then.

00:04:09.045 --> 00:04:09.855
And to prioritize it.

00:04:09.855 --> 00:04:13.455
And as you begin to prioritize
it in your life, begin to reflect

00:04:13.455 --> 00:04:15.015
on how valuable will be become.

00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:19.365
So we're going to kind of see through
today how valuable it truly is.

00:04:19.365 --> 00:04:20.475
So two weeks ago, just to kind of.

00:04:22.275 --> 00:04:25.365
Is a and part one, there's a
couple of things that we talked

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.295
about in the priority of prayer.

00:04:26.295 --> 00:04:28.545
We talked about this, we
talked about what is prayer.

00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:30.945
Prayer is a conversation with God.

00:04:31.155 --> 00:04:35.115
We talked about how we can pray through
petitions, prayers, intercessions,

00:04:35.115 --> 00:04:38.294
and Thanksgiving, which we delve
dove into those a little bit deeper.

00:04:38.294 --> 00:04:39.765
And so I'm not going to go
into deeper, but there's

00:04:39.765 --> 00:04:41.145
different ways that we can pray.

00:04:41.685 --> 00:04:45.945
Uh, we also learned that what our
outward posture should be when we pray.

00:04:45.945 --> 00:04:46.275
Right.

00:04:46.275 --> 00:04:48.344
And we talked about
our, our posture prayer.

00:04:49.484 --> 00:04:52.085
Uh, a reflection of our inward
posture, which means if we're

00:04:52.094 --> 00:04:55.275
praising, maybe our, our posture
prayers should be our hands up.

00:04:55.544 --> 00:04:59.895
If we're surrendering, maybe we should
be on the ground with our heads down.

00:05:00.164 --> 00:05:03.585
If we're, if we're giving
Thanksgiving, maybe it's our hands out.

00:05:03.794 --> 00:05:07.244
I don't know what it is, but we look at
this and the fact of prayer, our outward.

00:05:07.935 --> 00:05:11.775
Or look should look very much like
what our inward heart and praying is.

00:05:12.135 --> 00:05:13.635
We'll learn about where we can pray.

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:16.515
And the cool part that we learned is
we can pray anywhere because a lot of

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:20.685
times we try to say, the only time I
can pray is when I have five minutes

00:05:20.685 --> 00:05:23.925
or 10 minutes to go in the closet on
my knees with my eyes closed, which

00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:25.995
I suggest that you work into your.

00:05:27.075 --> 00:05:29.775
But if that's the only time you'll
pray, you'll never find time

00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:31.545
to pray and prioritize prayer.

00:05:31.545 --> 00:05:35.985
So we learned that praying can
happen anywhere in the car at

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:38.115
work at home in the church.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.120
We learned who we can pray for
this text was very specific.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.200
We can pray for everyone, but
specifically Paul talked about,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.630
especially those in authority over
us, especially those in authority.

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.010
And also we learned why we should
pray to help us live in peace

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.659
and at peace with everyone.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.090
And to please, God, those were the
last things that we talked about in

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.320
this text, really spoke about that.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.450
So as we continue to study
through this text, we're going

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.980
to continue to talk more about.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.660
Y we should prioritize the prayer
and the value that it brings

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.780
into our lives and how we can
begin to apply that to our lives.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.630
So we're going to jump into
this text and read today.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.580
I'm going to start with verse one
so we can kind of catch everybody

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.380
up and then we're going to jump in.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.100
So it says this in first Timothy
chapter two, verse one, it says,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.230
first of all, then I urge that
petitions, prayers, intercessions,

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.730
and Thanksgivings be made for.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.500
For Kings and all those who
are in authority so that we may

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.070
lead a tranquil and quiet life
in all godliness and dignity.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.510
This is good.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.850
And it pleases God, our savior
who wants everyone to be saved and

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.930
to come to the knowledge of the.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:49.614
Where there is one God and one mediator
between God and humanity, the man Christ

00:06:49.614 --> 00:06:54.715
Jesus who gave himself as a ransom
for all a testimony at the proper time

00:06:55.135 --> 00:06:59.695
for this, I was appointed a Herald
and an apostle I'm telling the truth.

00:06:59.934 --> 00:07:01.075
I'm not lying.

00:07:01.164 --> 00:07:04.734
And a teacher of the Gentiles
and faith and in truth.

00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:08.245
So let's pray before we jump
into this text, Lord Jesus.

00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:09.565
We are praying today.

00:07:10.635 --> 00:07:13.335
That your will be done well,
we're praying today, not free to

00:07:13.335 --> 00:07:15.345
bless what we are bringing Lord.

00:07:15.345 --> 00:07:18.675
We are praying that you
bring what you bless Lord.

00:07:18.675 --> 00:07:22.635
And we are praying that we are here to
have an open heart, to hear it, to be

00:07:22.635 --> 00:07:26.625
transformed by it and to go out and live
accordingly to it because we see its

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:29.205
value and our lives and those around us.

00:07:29.595 --> 00:07:32.805
So Lord, we love you and we
pray this in your heavenly name.

00:07:33.105 --> 00:07:33.605
Amen.

00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:37.485
So we see in this first
part is prioritizing.

00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:38.535
Prayer can lead people.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.980
To salvation, right?

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.160
It can lead people to
salvation, salvation of people.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.560
And so I want to kind of bring this
story together because one of the things

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.790
cool about walking through a book of
the Bible is that it all works together.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.110
So context is important.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.880
So number one, Paul, the apostle,
um, wrote this letter to Timothy

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:57.990
his true son in the face.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.500
Somebody that he most believe led to
faith in Christ that came on missionary.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.560
Paul that he trained up as a disciple
and see Timothy was an emphasis.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.810
We actually went to the first,
or we went through the book

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:09.920
of Ephesians, a couple of.

00:08:10.665 --> 00:08:12.585
Well, probably six, eight months ago,
we started walking through it and

00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:13.755
finished it a couple of months ago.

00:08:14.145 --> 00:08:17.715
Um, and in that book, we realized
that this was a difficult church

00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:19.815
and the reason why it was a
difficult churches, cause there was

00:08:19.815 --> 00:08:21.915
a lot of worldly things going on.

00:08:22.215 --> 00:08:26.055
And specifically for Timothy, he was
the pastor of this church and Paul

00:08:26.055 --> 00:08:28.695
was saying, Hey, I want to encourage
you and give you direction and wisdom

00:08:28.695 --> 00:08:29.865
on how to get lead your church.

00:08:30.105 --> 00:08:33.075
And he said, first of all, you
need to address false teachers.

00:08:33.075 --> 00:08:36.855
And so that was the first thing that
he says, Hey, Timothy, stay in emphasis

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:38.565
and address these false teachers with.

00:08:39.635 --> 00:08:42.395
And he says, now, Timothy, I'm
going to teach you what truth is.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.995
So he begins to dive into the
gospel and that's when Paul shared

00:08:45.995 --> 00:08:48.875
his testimony and he began to
say, this is what the gospel is.

00:08:48.875 --> 00:08:49.954
It's transformed my life.

00:08:49.954 --> 00:08:52.235
It's changed me and it
can change everyone.

00:08:52.235 --> 00:08:54.365
God saved me so that
it can change everyone.

00:08:55.115 --> 00:08:57.785
But then he reminded Timothy,
don't forget your call.

00:08:58.025 --> 00:08:59.824
Don't forget what God's done in your life.

00:08:59.824 --> 00:09:03.845
Timothy, to give you the power and the
encouragement to go out and, and address

00:09:03.845 --> 00:09:05.194
these false teachers and to teach them.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.290
And then he gets into chapter two and
he says, but before all this Timothy,

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:17.190
first of all, pray how many of y'all are
like me, where you want to go to work.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.720
You want to get the tasks done, and then
you want to reflect and go, Lord, bless.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.370
That's me.

00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:27.750
I want to go, we, we had mission teams
come in a week and it's all I've been

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.250
thinking about is what tasks can they do?

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.120
What tasks can they do?

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.599
And all of a sudden, the Lord's like,
what prayer are you praying to get

00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:38.250
wisdom, to have the right tasks that
those mission teams to do to fulfill

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.329
the mission that God's called us to do?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.620
Oh man, Lord, I'm sorry.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.349
Like I, I miss that even
in the midst of preaching.

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:46.140
So you understand this pastors
don't preach texts, that they

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.890
feel like they've gotten.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.670
Pastors preached texts that
they're dealing with and

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.170
struggling with alongside you.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.150
And then they have the responsibility
now to share with you and to also

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.180
labor alongside you in learning
how to prioritize these things.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.850
So even as a pastor, I'm learning
how to prioritize prayer.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.050
So here we are in the text.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.090
Paul is saying, first of all, pray,
and I want to challenge you with this.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.170
I want to ask this question.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.540
If you were 100%.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:17.325
That praying for someone
would change their lives.

00:10:17.445 --> 00:10:19.875
Would you do it by raising hands?

00:10:20.055 --> 00:10:23.415
If you knew 100%, if you prayed for
someone, it would change the lives.

00:10:23.445 --> 00:10:24.195
What'd you do it.

00:10:25.215 --> 00:10:25.645
Great.

00:10:25.645 --> 00:10:29.175
Majority of us would, but based upon
if you were to think back through

00:10:29.175 --> 00:10:33.345
what you're prioritizing your life,
does your life show that priority

00:10:33.345 --> 00:10:36.735
that you truly believe that that
somebody's life will be changed if you.

00:10:37.635 --> 00:10:39.405
And that's not just a, like, shot at you.

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:41.865
That's really just a conviction
where we have to begin to say, we

00:10:41.865 --> 00:10:44.685
say one thing, but we do another.

00:10:45.255 --> 00:10:46.635
And that's where you
hear this word hypocrite.

00:10:46.665 --> 00:10:50.895
And then I look at myself and go, man,
how many times do I say one thing yet?

00:10:50.895 --> 00:10:52.185
I do another.

00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:53.715
So I don't really believe what I say.

00:10:53.715 --> 00:10:57.375
So I want you to see where Paul connects
these two verses the first two verses

00:10:57.645 --> 00:11:00.285
of this talks about praying, right?

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:01.065
Priorities and prayer.

00:11:01.065 --> 00:11:05.415
The second two verses Paul's
prioritizing the idea behind that.

00:11:07.095 --> 00:11:10.515
Is a desire of God's heart and
it pleases him, but he desires

00:11:10.515 --> 00:11:11.655
for everyone to be saved.

00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:17.205
So when we pray, what this
connection makes is that we should

00:11:17.205 --> 00:11:18.555
pray for people to be saved.

00:11:18.735 --> 00:11:22.064
And that if we do, God will give
them the opportunity to be saved.

00:11:22.485 --> 00:11:23.655
Here's what God says.

00:11:23.865 --> 00:11:27.855
He desires that everyone come to
faith in Christ, every single person.

00:11:27.855 --> 00:11:30.325
Now does that mean every person will
come to faith in Christ that we pray for.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.579
But here's what I do believe that
when we pray that person will

00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:37.170
get the opportunity to respond.

00:11:37.979 --> 00:11:40.920
That's my person conviction based upon
the word of God, that if we pray for

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.520
someone to be saved, that they will
have the opportunity to be saved.

00:11:45.359 --> 00:11:49.349
Now here's the interesting part is we
begin to look at this many of our prayers.

00:11:49.349 --> 00:11:53.670
We pray, we tend to pray them
and we walk away hoping someone

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.810
else fulfills that prayer.

00:11:55.349 --> 00:11:57.270
Now I'm going to step ahead
and I'm going to come back.

00:11:58.515 --> 00:12:02.175
If all you can do is pray to
affect someone's life, pray.

00:12:02.715 --> 00:12:05.835
Cause there's some times when you pray and
there's nothing else you can do to change.

00:12:06.075 --> 00:12:07.035
Good example.

00:12:07.335 --> 00:12:09.855
Right now, we want to pray
for our leaders, right?

00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:10.915
The leaders across the world.

00:12:11.085 --> 00:12:11.295
Yes.

00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:12.945
We can donate and do
some things like that.

00:12:12.945 --> 00:12:16.665
But honestly, I can't go to Ukraine and
do anything about there specifically,

00:12:16.905 --> 00:12:18.165
so I can pray for their leadership.

00:12:18.165 --> 00:12:19.545
I can't change their
leadership outside of.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.100
So do that, don't neglect and
doing that, but there are certain

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.290
things we can do when we pray.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.000
And here's just an example.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.370
When we moved here, we prayed
for our neighbors to be saved.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.280
But when we pray for our neighbors
to be saved, guess what we started

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.540
doing, we connected with our neighbors.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.350
We shared the gospel with her neighbors
now because we're trying to like,

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.060
just convince them of something.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.750
Cause that's why we're here.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.750
We're literally because we love them
and we desire for them to know Jesus.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.870
So here's another one you
can pray for your marriage.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.199
If you've ever had marriage issues,
you should pray for your marriage.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.729
But a lot of times here's our prayer.

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:51.990
Lord, change his heart.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.370
Lord, change her heart.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.290
Lord, can he treat me better?

00:12:55.589 --> 00:12:56.640
Can he respect me?

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.050
Can she respects me?

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.849
And here's what God wants you to do.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.270
Yes.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.349
Pray those prayers.

00:13:01.709 --> 00:13:03.300
But here's what I would
challenge you to pray.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:08.099
Lord, help me be the solution to
the problem that I'm praying about.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.140
Many times we neglect and prayer.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.900
The response that God gives
us this sometimes says you've

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.050
already been given the ability to
affect the answer to that prayer.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.250
That challenged me when I started thinking
through that, that challenged me a lot.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.219
So when I ask this question, what's
another example that you can think

00:13:26.219 --> 00:13:31.140
of when you think of praying for
something and you have the ability

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.500
to help change the situation when
you pray maybe a past prayer that.

00:13:41.035 --> 00:13:44.574
Somebody's got to have one
here, reconciliation, right?

00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:46.074
Between another person
that maybe is wrong.

00:13:46.074 --> 00:13:46.725
Do you?
Right.

00:13:46.915 --> 00:13:50.454
That's a great example because again,
we're typically one-sided in our

00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:53.995
prayers and we want that person to
change, but in the process of praying.

00:13:54.825 --> 00:13:58.275
Person God's speaking back to
us about what can you do now?

00:13:58.275 --> 00:14:01.665
You can't fully help reconcile
that situation cause it takes two.

00:14:02.355 --> 00:14:05.565
But in that you have the ability
to take steps towards that.

00:14:05.865 --> 00:14:08.625
But again, I'll just come back to, I
do know that sometimes when we pray,

00:14:08.625 --> 00:14:12.015
we don't have the ability to affect
change, but we know that prayer

00:14:12.255 --> 00:14:14.975
changes lives, prayer changes lives.

00:14:14.975 --> 00:14:17.625
So with that knowledge,
that prayer changes life.

00:14:18.165 --> 00:14:21.135
Is there anything that should
stop us from prioritizing prayer?

00:14:21.165 --> 00:14:22.605
Anything there isn't.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.120
Been reading this book and I didn't plan
to share this, but I've been reading this

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.730
book called undistracted by Bob Goff.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.830
He just wrote this book and I follow him.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.300
And there's some things
that I totally agree with.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.940
There's some things that seem a little bit
different, but this undistracted book is,

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:41.130
is really challenging me because what he's
saying is we are distracted from doing

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.430
the most important things in our lives.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.470
And we're sacrificing the
great for the good or the.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.440
Too many times in our Christian walks.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.190
Here's what happens.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:57.930
And again, so, you know, I'm speaking
to myself in this, as we prioritize

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.260
coming to church, we prioritize
praying because we have to in reading

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.390
because we have to and giving, because
that's what we think we need to do.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.510
We prioritize those things
with the wrong heart.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.350
We are so distracted by those things
that we think are tasks that God

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:11.580
wants us to get a check mark for.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:12.900
Then the heart behind those.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.900
We're even distracted for.

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:17.219
We all just agreed.

00:15:17.219 --> 00:15:18.329
We should prioritize prayer.

00:15:18.329 --> 00:15:19.199
We see the value.

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:22.199
It changes lives, but many of us,
and almost say all of us, many of

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:23.490
us are saying, but I don't do it.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.870
So my challenge to myself and my
challenge to you is as I've been

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.750
praying to this Lord, how do I
start looking to things in my life?

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.320
And saying, those things are
distraction from what's best.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.650
That can not only change my life, but
you can change someone else's life.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.680
And that is where we're going
to continue to land today.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:45.180
So first three coming out of verse three,
Paul says, pray for everyone, right?

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.650
And he uses this word in verse three.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:47.340
That it's good.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.350
And as I began to study
this word, it's good.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.550
It sounds simple.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.680
But as you begin to study it,
the word good is actually.

00:15:54.165 --> 00:15:54.975
It's excellent.

00:15:54.975 --> 00:15:55.635
It's useful.

00:15:55.635 --> 00:15:56.745
It's praiseworthy.

00:15:56.745 --> 00:15:57.245
It's.

00:15:58.275 --> 00:16:01.725
So Paul's basically saying praying
is an awesome, amazing thing,

00:16:01.905 --> 00:16:03.345
because it can change your life.

00:16:03.345 --> 00:16:04.125
It is good.

00:16:04.335 --> 00:16:05.265
It is beautiful.

00:16:05.745 --> 00:16:07.455
But then he says it can please God.

00:16:07.965 --> 00:16:10.245
And so praying pleases God,
why would we want to please?

00:16:10.245 --> 00:16:10.745
God.

00:16:10.995 --> 00:16:14.835
Well, number one, because it shows our
dependence upon him when we accept Christ

00:16:14.835 --> 00:16:18.615
and we say, okay, Lord, we understand
that you are the one that created.

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:20.555
For a divine purpose.

00:16:20.765 --> 00:16:23.765
We know that you are the resource
to be able to fulfill that purpose.

00:16:24.035 --> 00:16:25.984
That you're the one that
guides and directs our lives.

00:16:26.104 --> 00:16:31.175
When we pray it's, it's, it's giving
ownership over our lives, back to him

00:16:31.234 --> 00:16:33.814
and that pleases him, that honors him.

00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:38.584
And so really when we look at this, it
shows that we know that God is the one

00:16:38.584 --> 00:16:42.574
that can make the difference prayers,
not about pleasing the world, pleasing

00:16:42.574 --> 00:16:44.974
someone else sounding religious.

00:16:45.334 --> 00:16:48.604
So if somebody ever asks you to pray and
you're like, ah, I struggle with prayer.

00:16:49.454 --> 00:16:51.194
Prayer's not about the right words.

00:16:51.225 --> 00:16:52.515
It's about the right attitude.

00:16:52.725 --> 00:16:55.665
So my encouragement is when
somebody says, Hey, will you pray?

00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:56.324
Pray?

00:16:56.805 --> 00:16:57.765
And sometimes I love it.

00:16:57.765 --> 00:17:00.704
My young son, son in here, Sterling,
whenever he praise, sometimes he praise

00:17:00.704 --> 00:17:04.545
her for some of the funniest things,
but here's what I love about it.

00:17:05.385 --> 00:17:06.435
His desire to pray.

00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:11.385
It's not about the words that he says,
but it's the desire in his heart.

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:14.235
And too many times we think, well,
what if I don't say the right word?

00:17:14.235 --> 00:17:15.585
What if I say something stupid?

00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:18.135
Here's the thing you will.

00:17:20.764 --> 00:17:24.724
If we understand that we're going to
quote unquote fail or make mistakes

00:17:24.845 --> 00:17:28.145
before we ever make them, we can
actually just be okay with that.

00:17:28.415 --> 00:17:31.895
And when you're in a room full of
people like this, that does life

00:17:31.895 --> 00:17:35.615
that knows, Hey, um, I know that,
uh, Amanda and Matt make mistakes.

00:17:35.615 --> 00:17:38.645
So if, if I make mistakes too,
they're not going to judge me.

00:17:38.764 --> 00:17:39.754
Don't say, don't you do.

00:17:39.815 --> 00:17:40.205
Okay.

00:17:40.205 --> 00:17:40.705
They're not gonna.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.439
But you get in a community like
that, where we all know that

00:17:43.439 --> 00:17:44.370
we're going to make mistakes.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.669
It's the place in which we can
do life together because we're

00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:48.870
not here to judge one another.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.730
We're here to build one another up now.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.060
So, you know, we will speak truth
into each other's life out of love,

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.610
because why we desire for you to
experience God in an amazing way.

00:17:59.909 --> 00:18:02.639
Not because we're judgmental,
but because we love you so much.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.370
And because you love me so much,
you'll do the same thing for me.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:10.695
So if you trip over your words, We've all
done it and we'll do it again next week.

00:18:10.815 --> 00:18:11.745
And the week after that.

00:18:11.865 --> 00:18:15.405
And the week after that, and
that's okay because that's who we

00:18:15.405 --> 00:18:17.265
are and that's why we need God.

00:18:17.955 --> 00:18:21.315
So prayer is about fulfilling
God's plans on earth, right?

00:18:21.315 --> 00:18:22.335
It's not about fulfilling ours.

00:18:22.335 --> 00:18:24.525
It's about fulfilling
God's plans on earth.

00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:25.605
So let me ask this question.

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:28.425
What are God's plans
that he wants to fulfill?

00:18:28.425 --> 00:18:28.995
Anybody know?

00:18:29.445 --> 00:18:30.735
What are God's plans that
he wants you to feel.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.600
Says it in verse four, somebody, somebody
repeat, what is verse four, say God's

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:47.050
ultimate plan is for everyone to be
saved, to understand the truth, right?

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.440
To see us many people saved and to
understand the knowledge and truth.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.160
God's plan on earth.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.390
Now here's the thing.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.020
I believe that God's deepest desire
is for everyone to be saved, right.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.980
And receive that knowledge.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.450
And that's where we see in verse four,
since creation, God has desired every

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:08.010
person to know their, why they've been
created and what they were created.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.770
Ever since creation, why were we
created and what we were created for?

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.810
So I started thinking through that and
I want to just kind of walk through

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:19.320
that a little bit, and I've got to
believe this will really point to some

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.950
things for us, as we think through this
as your why, like, why was I created?

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.230
And so I broke this down
to the three relationships.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:30.240
We were created to enjoy relationship
with God, to enjoy a relationship

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.150
with this creation and to draw,
enjoy a relationship with.

00:19:35.055 --> 00:19:37.305
And here's the interesting thing
without the fall happening.

00:19:37.305 --> 00:19:41.294
So the fall is Adam and Eve
shows the disobeyed God, and they

00:19:41.294 --> 00:19:43.425
broke their relationship and they
were kicked out of the garden of

00:19:43.425 --> 00:19:46.215
Eden without the fall happening.

00:19:46.245 --> 00:19:48.014
The why is the what for us?

00:19:48.465 --> 00:19:49.395
The why is the, what?

00:19:49.784 --> 00:19:50.355
Which means this?

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:54.495
We were created for relationship with
God, for relationship with his creation

00:19:54.615 --> 00:19:55.905
of a relationship with other people.

00:19:56.205 --> 00:20:00.165
When the fall happened, it changed
God, then gave us a mission to

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:02.085
help others discover Arthur.

00:20:03.435 --> 00:20:05.895
And they're what, so what I kind of
break this down, so you can kind of

00:20:05.895 --> 00:20:08.895
see it from a biblical standpoint,
but to enjoy a relationship with

00:20:08.895 --> 00:20:11.145
God, we were created for that right.

00:20:11.145 --> 00:20:12.315
To walk and peace with him.

00:20:12.315 --> 00:20:15.225
It says in the beginning, the
Adam and Eve walked in peace with

00:20:15.225 --> 00:20:18.375
God and to have complete access
to God, to his love and his grace

00:20:18.375 --> 00:20:19.605
and his mercy and his forgiveness.

00:20:20.145 --> 00:20:21.315
We were created.

00:20:21.315 --> 00:20:23.595
That's why we were created to
have a relationship with God.

00:20:23.865 --> 00:20:26.715
Number two, a relationship to have
a relationship with other people.

00:20:26.925 --> 00:20:27.885
Well, where's that in the Bible?

00:20:27.885 --> 00:20:30.225
Well, the Bible talks about early
again, I'm going to speak back to

00:20:30.225 --> 00:20:35.865
Genesis where Adam was created in, and
God said that he was not to be alone.

00:20:35.865 --> 00:20:37.125
It wasn't good for him to be alone.

00:20:37.125 --> 00:20:38.295
So they tried fountain finding to help.

00:20:38.295 --> 00:20:41.415
Mate, finally knocks Adam
out with a stone on the set.

00:20:41.415 --> 00:20:44.655
As my guests just knocked him, flat
out, took a rib out, just so you

00:20:44.655 --> 00:20:46.995
guys know this is how new I was
in my relationship with Christ.

00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:49.335
When I read that story, I
started thinking I had one.

00:20:50.445 --> 00:20:51.014
I'm serious.

00:20:51.014 --> 00:20:51.975
I started checking my ribs.

00:20:51.975 --> 00:20:52.865
I thought I had one less rib.

00:20:52.865 --> 00:20:55.785
Cause I thought every guy had one less rib
because that's how the wife was created.

00:20:55.815 --> 00:21:00.225
I have all the number of ribs I needed,
but again, I was willing to be stupid

00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:01.575
to just figure these things out.

00:21:01.935 --> 00:21:06.225
Um, I don't even know where I was
going with that, but so he, he

00:21:06.225 --> 00:21:08.024
makes the, the, the woman, right.

00:21:08.024 --> 00:21:09.524
And he says, this is right.

00:21:10.274 --> 00:21:11.895
You were built for relationship.

00:21:11.925 --> 00:21:15.645
And he says, be fruitful and multiply
and roll over everything together.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.830
So the world was not only created
for relationship, but the also

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.580
related, uh, created for, uh, the
creation to enjoy the creation.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.840
And so this is the interesting part.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.830
So I'm gonna kind of balance this.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.050
We were in ju uh, created
to enjoy creation.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.730
So this means this is it.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:30.150
Okay.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.710
As a Christian to actually enjoy.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:32.910
Yes.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.120
I used to think coming to faith
in Christ, man, I lost all my fun.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.660
And I realized coming to faith in
Christ gave me so much more joy than

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.910
I could ever get from the creation.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:43.110
So here's the example.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:50.910
So many times in the world, we worship a
creation that is failing, that will fail

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.220
you, that will deteriorate and fall away.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.120
When we can worship the creator,
which will never fail you,

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:58.560
that will never fall away.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.370
That will never die.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.790
So God has said you can enjoy
creation the beauty and the

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.990
glory and all the cool things.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.300
We have, all the technology, we
have it, as long as it doesn't

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.860
become the thing we worship.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:12.840
See that's when we get things out of line.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:13.710
So we were created.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.900
Why were we created for
relationship with God?

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.000
Let's ship with creation,
listed with other.

00:22:19.185 --> 00:22:21.885
But when the fall happened,
the what came into to life.

00:22:21.915 --> 00:22:24.915
And so this is the cool part, what
we were created for as to help

00:22:24.945 --> 00:22:29.145
others discover hope in Jesus, to
help them learn that they can help

00:22:29.175 --> 00:22:31.034
others discover that same hope.

00:22:31.784 --> 00:22:36.524
So when you break that down just a little
bit, this idea behind once the fall

00:22:36.524 --> 00:22:41.805
happened, That relationship with God, the
perfect relationship with God, the perfect

00:22:41.805 --> 00:22:44.595
relationship with creation, the perfect
relationship with others was broken.

00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:49.395
And those of us that now have been
restored through Jesus back to

00:22:49.395 --> 00:22:52.995
that original relationship with
God we're creation and other people

00:22:53.415 --> 00:22:58.544
now have hope now had the right
relationship that so many people

00:22:58.544 --> 00:23:00.885
are missing and God has given us.

00:23:01.815 --> 00:23:05.595
This hope to share with
others the what to go help.

00:23:05.625 --> 00:23:09.465
Every other person that we know,
discover that same hope in Jesus

00:23:09.765 --> 00:23:13.815
to live in freedom, to live in
forgiveness, to live in peace and

00:23:14.325 --> 00:23:18.315
patience and goodness and kindness and
all these things that God gives us.

00:23:19.335 --> 00:23:21.885
So God never created us
just to receive salvation.

00:23:22.365 --> 00:23:24.915
If that's all he created us for
guaranteed, this is what would

00:23:24.915 --> 00:23:25.995
happen in every church services.

00:23:25.995 --> 00:23:27.015
Somebody get their life to Christ.

00:23:27.195 --> 00:23:28.245
Somebody give their life to Christ.

00:23:28.275 --> 00:23:28.775
Bam.

00:23:30.629 --> 00:23:32.879
Wouldn't that be like crazy,
like, oh, they accepted Christ.

00:23:32.879 --> 00:23:35.310
Bam, they're gone, but he left you here.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:36.870
You woke up this morning.

00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:37.800
You're here.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.120
God's not done with you yet, but God,
I mean, I fulfilled like my, why?

00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:43.170
I mean a real issue with you.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.250
I have relationship with creation.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.420
I have relationship with other people.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.250
Um, good, great.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:53.340
But what God's saying is, but your
neighbors not, and maybe somebody

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.210
in your church right now is.

00:23:55.844 --> 00:24:01.915
And maybe your husband's not, or your
wife's not, or your child's not, I, I

00:24:01.955 --> 00:24:04.774
remember hearing this one of our first
sort of going to church, I can already

00:24:04.774 --> 00:24:05.945
tell you today's gonna be a long message.

00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:06.875
I'm gonna try to go shorter.

00:24:08.554 --> 00:24:12.665
Um, I remember a lot of the older people,
and this is not a getting knocked to them.

00:24:12.665 --> 00:24:15.304
This is just the way that they
would think they were like, I

00:24:15.304 --> 00:24:16.594
can't wait for heaven to come.

00:24:16.594 --> 00:24:17.735
I hope it comes tomorrow.

00:24:18.725 --> 00:24:20.885
And I would get emotional and
be like, I hope it doesn't.

00:24:20.915 --> 00:24:23.405
They're like why there's
still somebody else.

00:24:23.405 --> 00:24:23.905
I want to tell.

00:24:25.245 --> 00:24:26.685
I don't want them to miss out.

00:24:27.855 --> 00:24:32.565
And so for me, like, I don't
want that to happen tomorrow.

00:24:32.745 --> 00:24:36.825
One day, one day, I want to be
with the Lord and heaven and man,

00:24:36.825 --> 00:24:38.175
there'll be no fear, no pain.

00:24:38.175 --> 00:24:41.865
I want one to be there, but oh
God, please don't be tomorrow

00:24:41.865 --> 00:24:43.005
because there's one more friend.

00:24:43.335 --> 00:24:44.325
There's one more neighbor.

00:24:44.625 --> 00:24:47.085
There's one more person in this
service that I want them to know.

00:24:47.085 --> 00:24:47.745
Jesus.

00:24:48.675 --> 00:24:52.515
See, that's, that's what I believe
that God is saying through Paul.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:59.520
He desires that if we will prioritize
prayer, because it changes lives that we

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:05.280
will start seeing more and more people
come to know Jesus and experience the

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.260
hope that we've experienced their why.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:11.100
And they get to be a part of the what and
helping others discover hope in Jesus.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:11.790
So cool.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.750
How that all comes together.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.110
I started thinking through this
when we come to faith in Jesus and

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:20.170
we know the knowledge and truth,
we're a lot like soldiers who

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.340
are trained and ready to go into.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.410
Started thinking about when we come
to faith in Jesus and we begin to

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.370
understand knowledge and truth.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:30.120
We're a lot like doctors who are trained
for years and years and years to go out

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:35.040
and change lives through healthy things
that they begin to, prescriber surgeries

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.350
they do, or eyes, they fix whatever it is.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.850
Right.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.639
But imagine this a soldier to be
trained a doctor to be trained and

00:25:41.639 --> 00:25:43.590
to never go fulfill their call.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:44.879
Crazy.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.590
Why wouldn't they do that?

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:49.200
That's what they were
trained for every day.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.330
That you wake up and you're
still alive and you're breathing.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.690
You're a soldier, you're a doctor.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:01.370
You're a, whatever your profession
is, the in that God's going to use

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:07.160
that to go into battle, to help
other people discover hope in Jesus.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.190
See, God's not done with us yet.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.060
He's ready for us to be a part
of seeing other people be saved.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.640
So we have such an amazing
purpose to help others.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.890
Experience in eternity with God.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.030
And each of us, I believe is
here for one of two reasons.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.740
Number one, you're either here to receive
the knowledge and truth to be saved.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.260
Your why maybe you haven't
given your life to Christ.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.210
Maybe today's the day where
you're like, I see it.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:38.370
So maybe you're here for that today,
or there's the other group of us

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:42.750
that is here to help learn how to
help others discover hope in Jesus.

00:26:43.845 --> 00:26:48.855
The only two reasons why you should be
here not to just continue to, to just sit

00:26:48.915 --> 00:26:52.514
and receive, but to receive and to give.

00:26:54.284 --> 00:26:55.754
And I believe both of those starts with.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.410
The first one, when it comes
to giving your life to Christ

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.540
starts with the prayer, doesn't
have to be your eyes closed.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.530
It just has to be a confession to
the Lord of your need for Jesus.

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:08.639
Didn't he be forgiven of your sins
and to be able to walk in truth

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:11.850
and knowledge for the other group,
that's given your life to Christ.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.620
It's a prayer of boldness.

00:27:13.649 --> 00:27:17.610
It's a prayer of clarity on where
to go share that hope it's a, it's

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.660
a confidence, whatever it is that
you need to be able to receive from

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.730
the Lord direction starts with the.

00:27:24.915 --> 00:27:28.605
See, this text is very clear that Paul
is saying prioritize prayer because

00:27:28.605 --> 00:27:33.495
our greatest call in life is to help
other people discover hope in Jesus.

00:27:33.915 --> 00:27:36.165
I think I could stop right there
in the message and be done,

00:27:36.165 --> 00:27:37.185
but we're going to keep going.

00:27:39.735 --> 00:27:41.355
So how do we know what to share that?

00:27:41.375 --> 00:27:42.645
Maybe the question, how do we know?

00:27:42.645 --> 00:27:43.145
What does.

00:27:43.949 --> 00:27:45.120
So that other people can be saved.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.840
And I love how Paul answers that
question and verses five and six.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.770
And he says this for there is one
God and one mediator between God

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.189
and humanity, the man Christ Jesus,
who gave himself as a ransom for

00:27:56.189 --> 00:27:58.679
all a testimony at the proper time.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.659
So the knowledge and truth is
that Jesus is the only way to

00:28:03.659 --> 00:28:07.020
relationship with God, the knowledge
and truth that you need to share.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.860
The hope of Jesus with other
people is that there's only

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.780
a way to God through Jesus.

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:16.560
In order to know God and
experience his love, grace mercy,

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.900
forgiveness, hope, joy, blessing.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.060
I could have kept reading
and writing things.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.390
We have to accept Jesus who
was our mediator between God.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.850
Most of you may know this,
or may not know this.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.750
And the old Testament time, there was
a priest that was the mediator that had

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.870
to come to the priest to be able to have
access to God and be able to communicate

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:36.510
with God, God removed that and placed.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.800
And see, we didn't have to come to
Jesus to bring sacrifices anymore.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.370
God used Jesus as the ultimate
sacrifice to have access to God.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.860
So now we see this is clearly stating
that Jesus has now our mediator.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.160
The only way to get to God, to talk
with God, to have a relationship

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.870
with God is through Jesus.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:56.730
Sort of thinking about this.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.680
Some may think that is narrow-minded.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:01.590
If you live enough in this world,
there are so many different

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:05.340
beliefs to God and someone to
believe that always lead to heaven.

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.129
I think that complicates things.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.800
I believe this is clear and simple.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.360
I love clear and simple.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.760
And this is what I would always
say too, is if you're wondering,

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.020
is there multiple ways to heaven?

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.670
Why is it only Jesus?

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.090
And I'll tell you this, the reason why
I can tell you it's Jesus is because

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:26.520
I have tested and tried to many people
sit outside and they want to point

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:31.710
to Jesus is not the only way, but how
many of you have actually tried that?

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.450
Those who have said, have
you, have you actually tried?

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:34.560
I always tell people, try it.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.060
What do you mean.

00:29:35.835 --> 00:29:39.915
Get around people who know Jesus start
looking at their lives, stars, seeing

00:29:39.915 --> 00:29:44.895
them share testimonies where God shows up,
where he makes a difference in their life.

00:29:44.895 --> 00:29:49.155
And you go, man, I don't know,
but God's doing something

00:29:49.185 --> 00:29:50.565
through this guy named Jesus.

00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:53.925
But in many times we want to
be on the outside and say,

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:55.155
maybe there's multiple ways.

00:29:55.995 --> 00:29:57.105
I look at this as clear and cut.

00:29:57.125 --> 00:30:00.075
I love simple the way
to God's through Jesus.

00:30:00.735 --> 00:30:03.375
And we don't have to
wonder, you can know that.

00:30:04.875 --> 00:30:08.055
And verse six clearly tells
us it's not really about us.

00:30:08.115 --> 00:30:09.015
It's about Jesus.

00:30:09.015 --> 00:30:09.915
Jesus did all the work.

00:30:09.915 --> 00:30:11.115
He came at the proper time, right?

00:30:11.115 --> 00:30:11.715
The right time.

00:30:11.925 --> 00:30:14.535
He paid a ransom and this
is what it really means when

00:30:14.535 --> 00:30:15.675
he says he paid a ransom.

00:30:16.185 --> 00:30:18.315
It says a life for our lives.

00:30:18.465 --> 00:30:23.325
A ransom is what is given for
another, as a price of his redemption.

00:30:24.855 --> 00:30:29.295
So Jesus gave his so that we can have
ours back and spend an eternity with God.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:36.820
See Jesus said this that he says, and
I love this at the end of verse six, he

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:44.020
says, who gave himself as a ransom for
all his desire is that all would be saved.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.639
Jesus paid the price we couldn't in
order to save us from eternal punishment,

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.169
being separated from him forever.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.860
We've been talking about this for a couple
of weeks and I think it was two weeks ago.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.090
We really talked about this.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.080
We complicated.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.449
I think sometimes we complicate what
it means to give our lives to Jesus.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:03.300
I told you I was the same way.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.480
I spent a year in the church and
every time I become and I would

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.330
hear the gospel, here's what I would
think, man, I got to stop doing

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.220
this and I got to stop doing that.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.730
And man, I got to fix this and
I got to not use that word.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.510
And probably not that
word, maybe not that one.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:22.620
Um, and so like, it was all these things
that I had to do and changing, and I

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.050
started looking at it as a negative.

00:31:25.429 --> 00:31:26.870
But then something changed.

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:32.090
And I realized that I started seeing the
things that God was going to give me and

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:35.389
how I actually didn't have to do anything.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.090
God was already doing that in me.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.149
And through me, like those
words, just weren't words anymore

00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:42.110
that I really wanted to use.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:44.300
And those things weren't things I
really wanted to do anymore because I

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:48.020
saw God replacing them with something
more, something better when we.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.780
It is less than what God has for you.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.960
When we talk about sin, it's not about
all man, you're such a bad person.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.310
It's really all, man.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.350
You're missing the best
that God has for you.

00:31:59.129 --> 00:32:00.090
That's what God reminded me.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:04.200
So I gave up the second best or the
third best, or really the last best.

00:32:04.379 --> 00:32:06.360
And I got the best, best through Jesus.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:13.530
See, sometimes we make salvation too
difficult is truly just believing

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.139
who God is and how God sent his son.

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:16.670
Jesus.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:24.270
To help us know him, have access to him to
be forgiven of the sin and the difficulty

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:25.260
of trying to live in this world.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.620
A life that we struggle with every
day and to begin to trust the Lord, to

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.920
do that through us and to give us the
hope and peace and joy and comfort and

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.360
forgiveness, all these things to help
us not only change our lives to this

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.040
side of heaven, but to change others.

00:32:45.365 --> 00:32:48.065
So here's the interesting thing
as we kind of in today, and we're

00:32:48.065 --> 00:32:49.745
not closing, but we're ending.

00:32:49.955 --> 00:32:50.945
So I'm kind of getting there.

00:32:51.665 --> 00:32:57.125
Paul gives us this last verse and it talks
about really our calling specifically, but

00:32:57.125 --> 00:32:59.015
Paul really just talks about his calling.

00:32:59.405 --> 00:33:02.345
See, just to kind of summarize
this with Paul's story.

00:33:02.675 --> 00:33:08.765
Paul was the worst of the worst of the
worst of sinners and God saved him.

00:33:10.095 --> 00:33:12.885
And Paul didn't just say,
Lord, thank you for saving me.

00:33:12.885 --> 00:33:15.885
I can't wait to get to heaven to
spend the rest of my life with you.

00:33:16.335 --> 00:33:19.605
He took up his cross and he
began to fulfill his call.

00:33:19.605 --> 00:33:21.915
And this is one way in which
he did it here in verse seven.

00:33:22.155 --> 00:33:25.245
Paul says this, he says for, I
was appointed a Herald and upon.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.030
And I love how he says this.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.740
I'm telling the truth and I'm not lying.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:32.160
And a teacher of the
Gentiles in faith and truth.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.200
So Paul's calling was a Herald.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:35.850
I looked that up.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:39.630
I thought it was a person or some kind
of hairdo, but it was neither one.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:42.990
So I had to look at a little bit
deeper and it's really a Harold is a

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:46.230
preacher, a messenger or an ambassador.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:48.120
I promise to leave my jokes at home now.

00:33:49.189 --> 00:33:51.740
Um, the next thing he
talks about as apostle.

00:33:52.129 --> 00:33:55.939
So an apostle is just one with
authority since they had seen Christ

00:33:55.939 --> 00:33:57.740
after he had rose from the dead.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.580
Also, we see that he's a teacher
concerning the truths of God

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.020
and the responsibility of man.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:06.830
And he says to the Gentiles,
so what are Gentiles?

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:07.159
Anybody?

00:34:07.159 --> 00:34:11.179
That's not a Jew, anybody that was
not really the people of Israel.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.040
And so if you're not.

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.320
Uh, Jew, you're a Gentile basically.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:16.590
Right?

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:21.900
So Paul was called to be a teacher, a
preacher, a messenger, an ambassador,

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:27.179
an apostle to us through his word
and to those he was talking to,

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:29.489
and it says in faith and truth.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:32.100
And again, these are things that
were mentioned above it's through

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.040
the knowledge and truth that,
that he was speaking of earlier.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:37.679
So Paul's a great example
of someone we can call.

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:42.560
So he understood what he was called to do.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.060
So then what's our calling.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.350
What's our calling.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:48.409
I want to give you a couple of verses
and I don't think I had them put up here.

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:49.130
It's my fault.

00:34:49.339 --> 00:34:51.679
So if you want to, I actually
want you to turn to one of these.

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:53.150
If you have your Bible with
you, you have your phone.

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:57.560
I want you to turn to second Corinthians
chapter five, starting in verse 17.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.870
I'm going to read that one second,
but I'm going to summarize the

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:03.080
next one that I want to share with
you with most of us know, right.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.290
Is the great commission,
Matthew 28, 18 through 20.

00:35:07.319 --> 00:35:08.040
Speaks of this.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:08.970
He says Jesus.

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:11.850
At the end of his life, after his
resurrection, I guess it's after his life,

00:35:12.089 --> 00:35:16.859
death, resurrection, before he ascends to
heaven, he says to his disciples, he says

00:35:17.189 --> 00:35:22.319
to go there for, and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them and name of the

00:35:22.319 --> 00:35:27.029
father, son, the holy spirit and teaching
them all the things I've commanded you.

00:35:27.299 --> 00:35:29.609
And lo I will be with you wherever you go.

00:35:29.609 --> 00:35:31.290
That may be a KJV low word.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:32.790
I don't even know, but.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.020
That's the great commission.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.170
That's what God has given every one
of us, but many of us, again, I'm

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.800
this person knew reading my Bible back
whenever I'd give my life to Christ.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.750
And I see this and go
that's for the disciples.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.250
That's like for the pastors.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:45.750
Right?

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:48.670
So who's who w where, where else?

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.410
I mean, again, I think he's
talking to all of this.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:52.380
It's still got me thinking.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.750
Where's another verse that talks
about what our true calling is.

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:58.200
I love second Corinthians
five 17 through 21.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.310
So here's what it says.

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:03.390
Therefore, if anyone is in
Christ, let's stop right there.

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:08.160
If you've given your life to Christ, if
you would leave here today and say, man,

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.589
I know Jesus, I've given my life to him.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:12.720
Paul speaking to you.

00:36:13.665 --> 00:36:18.135
Not to just leaders, not to
apostles, not to just teachers,

00:36:18.135 --> 00:36:19.815
he's teaching, talking to all of us.

00:36:19.815 --> 00:36:20.655
So let's go forward.

00:36:21.495 --> 00:36:24.615
It says, therefore, if anyone is
in Christ, he is a new creation.

00:36:24.825 --> 00:36:28.695
The oldest passed away
and see the new has come.

00:36:29.295 --> 00:36:35.415
Everything is from God who has reconciled
us to himself through Christ and has

00:36:35.445 --> 00:36:38.595
given us the ministry of reconciliation.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.020
I'm going to keep going.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:44.000
That is in Christ.

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:48.410
God was reconciling the world to himself,
not counting their trespasses against him.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:52.160
And he has committed the
message of reconciliation to us.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:53.330
The church.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.030
Therefore, we are ambassadors.

00:36:58.495 --> 00:36:59.904
I remember that word from Paul.

00:36:59.995 --> 00:37:02.725
He was a Herald, which is
another word for ambassador.

00:37:02.725 --> 00:37:05.634
We're just like Paul we're
ambassadors for Christ.

00:37:05.815 --> 00:37:10.075
Since God is making his appeal through
us, we plead on Christ's behalf.

00:37:10.075 --> 00:37:11.545
Be reconciled to God.

00:37:11.755 --> 00:37:14.305
He made the one who did not
know sin to be sin for us.

00:37:14.305 --> 00:37:17.245
That in him, we might become
the righteousness of God.

00:37:18.325 --> 00:37:20.875
Our calling is clear.

00:37:23.135 --> 00:37:26.615
I say this every time we are
responsible for that, which we have

00:37:26.615 --> 00:37:31.655
been shared with and the things we
don't know don't understand yet.

00:37:31.715 --> 00:37:32.585
It's okay.

00:37:33.305 --> 00:37:36.935
But today we've all given the
responsibility of this reconciliation.

00:37:36.965 --> 00:37:38.075
Our call is clear.

00:37:38.225 --> 00:37:41.975
We each have a part in helping other
people be reconciled back to God.

00:37:43.805 --> 00:37:46.025
It starts though with us
being reconciled to God.

00:37:47.585 --> 00:37:48.925
So this is how I want to conclude.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.900
Because I think it's clear
the message is clear, but I'm

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:52.980
gonna bring this back around.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.030
How is prioritizing prayer,
a part of all of this?

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.660
Let me just kind of walk
through this with my own life.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:06.450
I am the result of someone else's
answered prayer, and I've shared that

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.880
with you before, but I'm going to
walk through this with these verses.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.410
I'm a result of someone else's
answer prayer, prayer, because

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:17.160
they prioritized prayer and it
was good and pleasing to God.

00:38:18.584 --> 00:38:23.084
Because it led me to being saved,
which was God's ultimate desire.

00:38:23.084 --> 00:38:25.365
And the person that prayed
for me is ultimate desire.

00:38:26.055 --> 00:38:29.024
I received the truth and knowledge
of God as I begin that relationship

00:38:29.024 --> 00:38:31.154
with him, which was God's desire.

00:38:31.845 --> 00:38:35.714
And I began to learn why I was
created and what I was created for.

00:38:37.064 --> 00:38:40.995
And I took that knowledge and truth and
begin to fulfill my calling to where I

00:38:40.995 --> 00:38:43.575
am today to reconcile people back to God.

00:38:43.754 --> 00:38:44.345
Not because I'm.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.290
That is one role in the church that
God has called me to, but God has

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.050
not only called me to help other
people be reconciled back to God.

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.970
He has called every
one of us in this room.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.500
Here's one of the coolest things I believe
each of you are in this service because

00:38:58.500 --> 00:38:59.790
of someone else has answered prayer.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.780
And if you want to know, who's mine, my
families, a lot of people in this church

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:08.820
to help start this church prayed for you.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.420
Maybe not by name.

00:39:10.529 --> 00:39:14.130
They begin to pray for, for people to
be safe for people to know who Jesus

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:17.310
is, to experience the hope and joy
and peace that we've all experienced.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.819
We begin to pray for you
two, three years ago.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.600
And for some of you are here
today to respond to that.

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.359
One of the coolest things, as I
begin to think through this is

00:39:28.359 --> 00:39:32.560
there's actually people in this
room who have been reconciled back

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:37.359
to God because of our prayers that
had begin to understand their.

00:39:38.985 --> 00:39:43.815
And are starting to experience being
part of the, what it's so cool.

00:39:43.815 --> 00:39:47.955
How this flows through that people are
being reconciled back to God because

00:39:47.955 --> 00:39:49.875
of a faithful prayer three years ago.

00:39:51.985 --> 00:39:54.565
And there's more people now that
are coming and being reconciled

00:39:54.565 --> 00:39:57.775
back to God to start this whole
process over process over together.

00:39:57.835 --> 00:40:02.424
Again, why is prayer important?

00:40:02.725 --> 00:40:04.195
Why should we prioritize prayer?

00:40:04.345 --> 00:40:05.785
It changes like.

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:07.919
It changes lives.

00:40:08.879 --> 00:40:12.720
There is someone I'm just gonna tell
you right now there, someone, I love

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.450
saying this and you guys may get tired
of it, but there is someone waiting

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:19.649
on you on the other side of you boldly
praying for God to change their life.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:23.160
And after you pray it, I believe
this is what God's saying.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.240
How can I be a part of it?

00:40:24.629 --> 00:40:28.589
You leave that prayer and you say, Lord,
you do what only you can do, but I'm going

00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:30.569
to do what I can through that powerful.

00:40:31.575 --> 00:40:32.955
And then I'm going to start sharing.

00:40:32.985 --> 00:40:34.005
I'm going to start inviting.

00:40:34.185 --> 00:40:35.445
I'm going to start connecting.

00:40:35.565 --> 00:40:36.345
I'm going to love them.

00:40:36.345 --> 00:40:37.275
I'm going to be generous.

00:40:37.455 --> 00:40:40.425
I'm just going to live my life out
for Christ to be the light of Christ.

00:40:40.545 --> 00:40:41.865
I'm going to pursue Christ.

00:40:41.955 --> 00:40:46.005
So they, it permeates out of my life
and it changes that person's life.

00:40:47.505 --> 00:40:50.845
I believe that is what
God is calling us to do.

00:40:52.109 --> 00:40:52.950
To say, you know what?

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.750
I'm gonna look at my priorities
this week and I'm going to

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:56.279
put number one with prayer.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.660
I'm going to cover my work and prayer.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.859
I'm going to cover my school in prayer.

00:40:59.069 --> 00:41:02.220
I'm going to cover my friends and
prayer and my family and prayer.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:07.080
And every one of my kids' activities
and prayer, so that when I go do those

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:11.609
things that the Lord leads and directs
my life, the Lord will work through my

00:41:11.609 --> 00:41:13.290
life to help change those people's lives.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.210
Reconcile them back to God.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.620
You may struggle with this one
statement, but I don't know

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:20.580
enough knowledge and truth.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:27.850
If you know enough to be saved,
if you know enough of what God's

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:32.650
done for you to share that God
will not let any word return, void

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.540
that and what you share in faith.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.200
So what's our next step with this text.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.780
I want to challenge a couple of
different things and we're going to pray.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:44.800
Number one, both of the steps I'm going
to challenge you to start with prayer.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.780
Number one is if you
haven't given your life to.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:48.959
It starts with prayer.

00:41:49.529 --> 00:41:50.910
It starts with saying, yes, Jesus.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:51.330
Today.

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:53.040
I need you today.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.240
I need to be forgiven of my sins.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:58.049
I understand that that is holding me
down from the life that you have for me.

00:41:58.709 --> 00:42:01.770
And today you need to
say, Lord, I'm yours.

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:02.879
I want to know you.

00:42:02.879 --> 00:42:06.359
I want to experience hope, joy, peace,
patience, love all these things.

00:42:06.359 --> 00:42:06.870
Forgiveness.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:08.640
I want to experience that today for you.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.899
That may be your next step.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.509
And today is the day of salvation.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.680
Do not let a pack.

00:42:16.195 --> 00:42:17.515
Because you are not promised tomorrow.

00:42:17.515 --> 00:42:18.835
And that is not a fear tactic.

00:42:19.825 --> 00:42:24.625
That is a love tactic, because if you know
somebody who's walking in front of a car,

00:42:24.625 --> 00:42:27.325
you're going to stop Marsha every week.

00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:32.065
When I preach every time that I talked
to you during the week, I am wanting

00:42:32.065 --> 00:42:34.015
to stop you from getting hit by a car.

00:42:34.255 --> 00:42:35.545
And that may sound funny to you.

00:42:37.975 --> 00:42:38.935
I don't just preach.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.260
These things.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.760
Cause that's what I do.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.710
I told it because I believe it.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.880
And I believe that God is calling
someone, some multiple people in this

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.440
room to come to know Jesus today.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.300
The question is, where do you start?

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.680
Where does it start?

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.350
It starts with taking a next step.

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.020
Sometimes it seems like a leap.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.580
The cool party is here.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.840
We celebrate steps.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.140
So what I am going to do, and I do
this every week and I'm challenging

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.520
somebody to be bold in their faith.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.920
I don't have you close your
eyes, bow your head and.

00:43:08.985 --> 00:43:11.025
If you want to do that, we
can do that during service.

00:43:11.205 --> 00:43:13.215
I'm going to say this I'm
going to be in the back.

00:43:13.635 --> 00:43:16.455
And if you get up during the song
service while we worship and you

00:43:16.455 --> 00:43:19.065
come talk to me, nobody's going
to be whispering, pointing, going.

00:43:19.065 --> 00:43:19.935
I wonder what they're doing.

00:43:19.935 --> 00:43:20.865
They're going to celebrate.

00:43:22.065 --> 00:43:23.295
So I challenge you.

00:43:23.535 --> 00:43:26.025
If you need to know Jesus today,
you come back and talk to me.

00:43:26.205 --> 00:43:30.165
You say, I don't maybe know it all, but
today I want to experience this hope.

00:43:30.465 --> 00:43:32.055
I challenge you.

00:43:32.175 --> 00:43:32.685
Don't.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.200
Sissy out.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:38.940
Don't, don't feel like somebody's
staring at you because we are only

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.279
staring to celebrate and praise God.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:44.770
So I challenge you to take that next step.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:47.589
And if I'm back there and three
people come up, there's going

00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:49.720
to be three more people come up
and help me and talk with you.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:53.560
I don't know who needs to know Jesus
today, but that may be your next step.

00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:55.180
And that's the first
prayer you need to pray.

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.990
But if you have given your life to
Christ, and if you end up giving

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:01.779
your life to Christ today, your
next step is to begin to pray.

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:03.350
Pray.

00:44:04.049 --> 00:44:05.580
We don't have to pray
with our eyes closed.

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:07.110
We don't have to lay
on the ground and pray.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.040
We just need to pray.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.680
However, God lays on our heart
because it shows our dependence

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.270
upon him that he wants to move.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:16.080
And the people around you and you begin to
boldly pray every day and you prioritize

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.850
prayer to every aspect of your life.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:20.850
Not with perfect words, but with
the right attitude of the heart,

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.420
and God will, God will, God will.

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.840
God will change lives.

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.100
I don't know about you.

00:44:31.285 --> 00:44:34.705
But God wants to use you to
reconcile people back to him.

00:44:35.935 --> 00:44:39.145
I think God is going to do some
amazing things through this church.

00:44:40.355 --> 00:44:44.725
We'll prioritize sprayer to let's
pray, Lord Jesus, you are good.

00:44:44.935 --> 00:44:45.925
You are God.

00:44:46.615 --> 00:44:51.145
You know who in this room where
doesn't know you and who needs to

00:44:51.145 --> 00:44:55.675
have the boldness to stand up and step
out and to say, I need to know you.

00:44:56.774 --> 00:44:58.575
So Lord, I pray for that person today.

00:44:58.935 --> 00:45:01.725
The, whenever I get done praying Lord
and I walked to the back that they don't

00:45:01.725 --> 00:45:06.674
wait an extra second, but they get up and
they come and talk to me, Lord, I pray

00:45:07.365 --> 00:45:10.845
the Lord, the enemy doesn't come in and
still their confidence and what they need.

00:45:12.125 --> 00:45:12.365
Lord.

00:45:12.365 --> 00:45:15.815
I also pray for the person in this
room who hears this today and hasn't

00:45:15.815 --> 00:45:17.495
been prioritizing prayer, Lord.

00:45:17.495 --> 00:45:20.944
I pray for that person not to leave out
of here, feeling burdened with guilt,

00:45:20.975 --> 00:45:24.935
that they haven't prayed, but with
the opportunity of joy, leaving out of

00:45:24.935 --> 00:45:28.895
here with the opportunity to pray Lord,
knowing that you've given them the clear

00:45:28.895 --> 00:45:30.815
conviction that it will change lives.

00:45:30.815 --> 00:45:34.415
If we prioritize it, Lord
help that person today.

00:45:34.775 --> 00:45:35.765
Take that next step.

00:45:36.754 --> 00:45:38.884
Every next step that we
take Lord towards you.

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.060
Lord you celebrate.

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.189
And we celebrate as a church.

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:46.020
God, I pray.

00:45:47.279 --> 00:45:50.310
And the days and weeks to come,
that you continue to change lives

00:45:50.819 --> 00:45:54.720
through our prayers because it
shows our dependence upon you.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:57.569
So Lord Jesus, we pray
this in your heavenly name.

00:45:58.629 --> 00:45:59.129
Amen.
