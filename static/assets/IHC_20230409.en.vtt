00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
(orchestral music)


00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.100
- All right, I know there's still a ton


00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.960
of conversations happening.


00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.280
One of the things that I do love about our church


00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.120
is that conversations are happening.


00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.480
And so as you find your seats,


00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.840
let me encourage you, continue those after service.


00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.400
That's why we usually give about five minutes.


00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.800
It's not just to get the kids out,


00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.500
but it's also to just give you guys some space to connect.


00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.080
As a church, we wanna continue to prioritize community


00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.200
because we believe that's why God has created us,


00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.720
is to live in community.


00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.280
And that's one of our goals as a church,


00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.360
is that a person doesn't come in these doors


00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.880
without feeling connected with,


00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.880
and we continue to wanna invite you into our family.


00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.160
And so, as we think about today,


00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.200
and we think about Easter,


00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.880
churches and believers all over the world


00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.800
are celebrating Easter Sunday.


00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.360
And it's worthy to be celebrated


00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.640
because of what God did through Jesus


00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.160
and raising him from the dead.


00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.100
And something that we're gonna talk about today


00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.480
and just really try to focus on


00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.980
is this idea of celebrating Easter every day,


00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.880
not just on Easter Sunday


00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.640
because it's worthy to be celebrated.


00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.600
But there's a couple of things as a church we think through


00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.440
that it's worthy to be celebrated as well.


00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.000
Two years ago, even though we celebrated it last week,


00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.420
two years ago, we actually celebrated


00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.880
our two-year anniversary and we actually launched on Easter


00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.480
because Easter changes Sundays.


00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.960
And so Easter Sunday always brings up memories


00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.400
of how we started as a church and what God's done


00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.880
in and through our church in the last two years.


00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.920
And it's amazing to see that as well and be a part of that.


00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.880
But something I wanna share with you


00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.880
before we jump into today's message


00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.240
is what I'm gonna be talking about


00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.120
in the next several weeks.


00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.680
It's a new message series that I'm gonna be doing.


00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.720
And the reason why I'm telling you now


00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.160
is because I want you to plan to be here too.


00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.360
I want you to invite somebody.


00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.360
And so we're gonna talk about in the next couple of weeks,


00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.920
this message series called Shalom Shalom.


00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.680
And that means basically perfect peace.


00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.960
And what we're gonna talk about


00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.040
is how there's some familiar people in the Bible.


00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.940
As we begin to follow them,


00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.360
they dealt with the same struggles that we dealt with


00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.860
in some areas that I think will speak to the majority


00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.580
of the people in this room,


00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.080
it speaks to me, but also in our community,


00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.640
those of us that deal with anxiety, worry, depression,


00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.600
and so much more.


00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.560
And so I'm excited to be able to walk through that with you


00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.640
over the next several weeks.


00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.960
So make sure you invite somebody to come


00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.600
be a part of that as well.


00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.540
So whenever I started thinking about today


00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.240
and I started thinking about a message


00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.060
that God would share in and through me.


00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.360
One of the things that I just was reminded of is,


00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.200
we typically as a church, and I say church,


00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.760
the whole church, we really work hard.


00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.200
Easter's coming, Easter's coming,


00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.280
and we put all this prep and all this work into one Sunday,


00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.600
which praise God, I'm glad we do,


00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.720
'cause it is an amazing weekend.


00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.200
But then I started just thinking,


00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.040
isn't Easter just as important the day after Easter?


00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.040
And isn't Easter just as important the day before Easter?


00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.440
because Jesus has risen.


00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.980
His sacrifice on the cross and his life coming back to life


00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.080
means so much because it now changes our ability


00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.000
to have a relationship with God.


00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.220
And so I just was challenged with that thought


00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.460
and I began to think through how important it is


00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.700
to celebrate Easter and everything that Jesus did


00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.360
every single day.


00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.060
But we're really gonna just even talk about


00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.660
Jesus himself today and his ministry


00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.540
and we're gonna talk about the resurrection obviously


00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.100
and we're gonna talk about his call to us,


00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.940
really his message, his eternal message,


00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.760
and how that applies to every single one of us


00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.980
to consider Jesus.


00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.060
And so this is my challenge to you today


00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.620
as you begin to think about today


00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.060
is to not just think about Jesus only on Easter,


00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.360
or not to just think about Jesus only on Sundays,


00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.460
but to consider Jesus every day,


00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.240
to consider who he is every day.


00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.500
Because if you will consider who he is every day,


00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.220
it will transform your life every day.


00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.540
And that matters because God didn't send Jesus


00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.060
just to die for a moment in your life of salvation.


00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.500
He didn't die for just an Easter Sunday


00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.700
for you to attend in your life.


00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.820
He died so that you could have a relationship


00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.340
every moment, every day of your life


00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.660
and experience who God is


00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.540
to be able to experience his love, grace, and mercy.


00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.600
And so when we think about this idea of who Jesus is,


00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.000
we start thinking about this idea of our need for Jesus.


00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.120
And just wanna ask this question,


00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.480
does anybody in here consider themselves perfect?


00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.720
Anybody?


00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.920
There might, if there was kids still in here,


00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.880
guarantee hands would be going up.


00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.940
And here's the thing, if you would maybe consider that idea,


00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.720
hey, praise God, maybe that is something in your life


00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.760
where you're pursuing perfection.


00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.480
But as we really begin to look around,


00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.600
we probably understand that we all have something


00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.380
that we struggle with, something that we're not


00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.580
the greatest that we're not perfect with.


00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.900
And so here's the great thing


00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.000
that we're gonna learn today.


00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.080
Jesus works the best with those who are broken,


00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.380
those who are not perfect.


00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.340
And I think that's gonna be true of us today.


00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.780
And I wanna share this with you today


00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.400
when we think about Jesus


00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.260
and we think about why it's important to celebrate Jesus.


00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.660
In John 14, six, it says this,


00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.700
"Speaking to one of his disciples,


00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.420
"Jesus told him, I'm the way, the truth, and the life.


00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.860
"And no one comes to the Father


00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.460
"except through me."


00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.720
When I start looking at that statement,


00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.380
it is a very inclusive, or excuse me, exclusive statement.


00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.200
As a society, we're very inclusive.


00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.200
We wanna include everybody,


00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.520
and I believe Jesus wants everybody to come to faith in him,


00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.160
but that statement is very exclusive,


00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.060
meaning that Jesus is the only way.


00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.920
And when we think about a world that we live in


00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.520
and the idea that we have many religions,


00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.240
Jesus tends to set himself apart as he is the only way.


00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.460
And so as we consider Jesus,


00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.040
we need to consider the fact that Jesus


00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.520
could be the only way.


00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.000
If you're in this room and you're wondering,


00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.360
is Jesus the only way?


00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.020
I think we should consider if Jesus is the only way.


00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.480
And I think it's important as you're considering today,


00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.320
as before we kind of jump into this,


00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.600
I'm not asking you to consider our church.


00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.600
I'm not asking you to consider our denomination.


00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.920
I'm not asking you to consider Christians.


00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.840
I'm not asking you to consider me.


00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.320
We're all imperfect.


00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.240
But Jesus is the one in which I think all of us


00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.080
should consider when we're thinking about who he truly is,


00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.520
what he claims he is, what others have claimed he is,


00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.200
and his message as a whole,


00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.120
that he is the risen savior here to redeem the world,


00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.000
to save the world from their sins.


00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
So I'm gonna pray for us, and then we'll jump in.


00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.300
Lord Jesus, we thank you so much for today.


00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.760
We thank you for the opportunity to gather together,


00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.320
to be able to remember what you've done for us.


00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.900
But Lord, I just pray that if there's a person in this room


00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.920
that is far from you, Lord,


00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.640
maybe they gave their lives to you before,


00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.680
and they've really just fallen away from the church,


00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.820
or Lord, if it's somebody that doesn't know you,


00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.920
I pray that today you begin to draw them closer to you


00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.960
and that they'll consider who you truly are


00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.560
and they'll begin to be changed and transformed


00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.280
to be able to walk in a relationship with you daily.


00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.840
And Lord, I just pray as a church and as a pastor,


00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.520
Lord, I pray that we walk alongside every single person


00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.360
that is pursuing a relationship with you


00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.880
and continue to encourage them in this journey.


00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.400
And so Lord, we just pray this in your heavenly name, amen.


00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.080
So the first thing that I want you to consider about Jesus


00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.280
is his ministry, his ministry and why he came.


00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.800
And so let's look at Mark chapter two, verses 16 and 17.


00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.120
I'm gonna have all the verses behind us.


00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.680
I'm gonna be jumping around different verses.


00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.320
If you're used to working here with me,


00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.800
typically I'm walking through books of the Bible,


00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.600
but we are gonna be kind of jumping around today.


00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.600
But in Mark chapter two, verses 16 and 17,


00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.680
here's what it says.


00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.280
When the scribes and the Pharisees,


00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.280
so these are religious leaders basically,


00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.560
when they saw Jesus was eating with the sinners


00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.760
and the tax collectors, they asked his disciples,


00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.800
Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?


00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.920
When Jesus heard this, he told them,


00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.600
"It is not those who are well that need a doctor,


00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.500
"but those who are sick.


00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.200
"I didn't come to call the righteous, but the sinners."


00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.100
When we think about this idea and this question


00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.840
where I asked if anybody was perfect in this room,


00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.020
and I didn't see any hands,


00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.940
some of you may have wanted to raise your hands,


00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.000
but if you represent this idea of not being perfect,


00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.580
Jesus came for you, he came for me.


00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.680
And I think at times the church,


00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.080
and I say the church as a whole,


00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.260
can sometimes misrepresent Jesus.


00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.560
And what do I mean by this?


00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.940
I don't know if you've ever been a part of a church,


00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.280
I know I have before,


00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.240
where if somebody different walks in,


00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.160
that's not like me, doesn't dress like me,


00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.280
doesn't smell like me, doesn't act like me,


00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.560
we tend to act like they can't be a part of the church


00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.960
because of those different things.


00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.360
Now, most Christians probably wouldn't verbally say that,


00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.200
but have you ever been in a room full of,


00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.780
or around somebody that,


00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.680
they don't have to say a word


00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.320
to tell you what they're thinking?


00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.120
Well, I've been a part of a church before


00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.220
where it seems like that if anybody's different than them,


00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.600
then you're not really welcome.


00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.680
And I'll just give you an example.


00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.220
I remember being a part of a church


00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.000
where somebody told me, hey, they really,


00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.840
they came and found me.


00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.660
I was an executive pastor at that time.


00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.140
They found me and they said, hey, did you see that person


00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.940
walk into the service with a hat on?


00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.480
And I said, there's somebody new here?


00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.300
Like, great, that's awesome.


00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.620
They're like, no, we need to go tell them


00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.460
to take their hat off.


00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.140
And I was like, what?


00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.420
Like, what are you talking about?


00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.060
And so you understand this,


00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.700
keep your hats on if you got 'em.


00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.860
That's not a problem.


00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.580
But what I found was they were more worried


00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.940
about the hat rather than that there was actually


00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.940
somebody there to be a part of the church.


00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.860
And the reason why I say this is at times,


00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.860
people will begin to think that the only way


00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.180
in which you can be a part of a church,


00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.420
the only way you can be a part of Christ


00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.620
is if you are perfect.


00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.580
If you come in looking the part, acting the part,


00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.420
and coming in with a great story,


00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.660
'cause you guys know this,


00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.220
if you come in and you say, hey, how's your day?


00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.660
we better say it's good because the moment that I say


00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.940
that my life's struggling or our marriage is needing prayer,


00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.420
man, that's not a place for the church.


00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.820
That's what some people will say.


00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.220
I'll say this, if you come in and I ask how your day's doing


00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.740
and you say, "Hey, it's horrible,"


00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.240
this is the place for you.


00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.100
If you're saying you're having struggles in your marriage


00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.540
or finances or family or just mentally or physically,


00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.460
man, this is the place to be because this is a church


00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.140
that says, "Hey, I've been there before.


00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.300
"I know a God who cares directly for you."


00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.900
And this really made me start thinking about this.


00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.000
Anybody recently seen the new movie out


00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.900
called Jesus Revolution, anybody?


00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.000
Like nobody, great, I can fill you in.


00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.560
So Jesus Revolution is about a story


00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.840
about a church that was their old standard church,


00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.160
what I would say is your old Southern Baptist church, right?


00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.720
Everybody wore the right thing,


00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.580
everybody was quiet while the pastor preached.


00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.120
The pastor preached a pretty typical message.


00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.920
It was the same people that showed up every week


00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.740
and they went home every week satisfied.


00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.500
Until one day the pastor decided


00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.380
something seems wrong here.


00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.100
There's no life in the church.


00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.500
There's no excitement in the church


00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.120
about what God has done, speaking of Easter.


00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.980
And he began to say, why?


00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.100
And he began to seek the Lord.


00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.500
And it was interesting, his daughter met a friend.


00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.500
And in those days, these were the 60s and 70s,


00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.500
it was a hippie, somebody who was different.


00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.900
And he came to church,


00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.900
and he began to help transform that church


00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.100
because the pastor said, hey, y'all come on in.


00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.000
and he came in with no shoes.


00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.700
Matt's done that a couple times.


00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.060
It's totally cool, no shoes are fine.


00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.540
Came in with no shoes, hair wasn't nice,


00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.180
clothes weren't nice, and he actually spoke up


00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.720
during the pastor preaching, which was the big no-no then.


00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.360
And the pastor began to kind of see some life.


00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.200
Well, here was the cool part,


00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.460
this hippie brought some friends,


00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.100
and some more friends, and some more friends,


00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.380
and eventually the members began to complain.


00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.540
Why?


00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.300
Because something was different.


00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.300
And when they began to study the text


00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.100
of Mark chapter two, verses 16 and 17,


00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.780
it sounded like this is exactly


00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:30.700
what the church should look like.


00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.380
And actually, some of those church members left,


00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.020
and they had to get a bigger building,


00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.820
and more people came to faith in Christ,


00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.660
and more people came.


00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.880
And so, all that to say is Jesus came


00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.500
for people that I would even say are like me.


00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.460
Even as a pastor, I am not perfect.


00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.540
And that may be surprising to you,


00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.760
but it's very not surprising to me at all,


00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.060
that we all have struggles.


00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.300
And so, I believe that this text reminds me


00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.780
of obviously that movie,


00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.300
that Jesus came not for the righteous, right, the perfect,


00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.100
but those who don't have it all together,


00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.980
those who don't have it all together.


00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.260
And when I begin to think about this,


00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.340
he came for those who religion typically rejected.


00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.220
And this is why we talk about that as a church,


00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.380
it's not about religion, it's about relationship.


00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.580
Religion is trying to push an idea that is perfection


00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.620
and this idea of a standard that we have to meet.


00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.420
And relationship is a standard that Jesus has already met.


00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.780
And that's what challenges me.


00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.620
If I can speak truth to you today,


00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.380
and I tried to speak this a little bit last week


00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.940
if you were here.


00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.100
As a pastor, I would not stand here today


00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.500
trying to preach a message of Jesus


00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.500
and what he's done just for kicks and giggles.


00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.860
Like why would I even want this role?


00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.020
Because this role is not easy.


00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.300
And the reason why I end up pastoring and preaching


00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.180
is because God has so transformed my life


00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.740
through relationship, not religion.


00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.720
God is so transformed from my life,


00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.760
he was the one that sat at the table with me


00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.860
when I was a sinner, broken,


00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.180
and he still sits with me whenever I'm broken,


00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.700
and he invites more people into that,


00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.220
and I wanna be a part of that.


00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.800
I don't know about you guys, I wanna be a part of people


00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.700
that welcomes anyone to the table.


00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.380
I don't care what your background is.


00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.300
Jesus said he ate with sinners, he was friends with sinners.


00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.600
And here's the cool part,


00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.100
unless you don't know this, we're all sinners.


00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.100
So Jesus sits and eats with every one of us.


00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.700
And so when you consider the ministry of Jesus,


00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.900
it was unique from all forms of religion.


00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.140
He did all the work to redeem us and save us.


00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.640
And most forms of religion cause us


00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.380
to have to work for our salvations.


00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.980
And it's this idea of, I think,


00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.660
I've been having some conversations lately,


00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.620
it's hard to let people do things for you.


00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.300
It's hard to let people do things for you.


00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.140
Why?


00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.380
Because especially if you're a guy,


00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.900
does anybody hate asking for help?


00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.780
I don't like asking for directions,


00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.380
'cause that's not manly.


00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.280
That's why I have Siri and Google Maps now.


00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.920
But we don't like asking for help.


00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.080
Well, you know what we have to do when it comes to Jesus?


00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.240
We have to actually admit that we need help.


00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.520
And I think that's the hard part.


00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.120
As when we think about religion,


00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.340
we actually like to work for things.


00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.600
We like to do things in order to earn things.


00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.960
Well, Jesus has done it all.


00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.760
And whenever I think about our church as a whole,


00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.940
I wanna communicate this


00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.760
because I want you to see this picture here.


00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.000
When I start seeing the people


00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.720
that have come to Inspire and Hope Church,


00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.280
here's what I see.


00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.760
I see people from all different walks of life, right?


00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.440
Different past religious experiences,


00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.880
which most of you may not even know this,


00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.000
but like our backgrounds in Southern Baptist,


00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.800
but I would say we have more non-background


00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.680
Southern Baptist people than we have that.


00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.120
And that may not mean anything to you,


00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.080
but I think that's a big deal


00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.920
whenever you think about a church full of people


00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.800
who have different ministry backgrounds,


00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.360
religious backgrounds, right?


00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.280
We have different economic, race, place of origin.


00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.700
I say place of origin, meaning we have people


00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.640
that are outside of just Hamilton, right?


00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.580
from all the way from California, Oklahoma,


00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.400
some other crazy places, right?


00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.740
Was it Jamaica, right?


00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.620
Is that where, Jamaica, we even have Jamaica.


00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.020
This is awesome, yeah.


00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.380
So whenever you think about this, what holds us together?


00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.420
What holds us together as a church?


00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.780
I would say this, common grace.


00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.260
Common grace of Jesus.


00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.620
Jesus met every single one of us at that table


00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.340
that he welcomed everyone to.


00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.780
And here is the cool part.


00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.720
This is what I love about Easter.


00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.200
Easter reminds me of that church,


00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.600
that that's the church we wanna be,


00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.040
that that's the church we wanna continue


00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.520
to communicate to our community that we wanna be.


00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.840
And why are we meeting in a gym and a YMCA?


00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.380
Because it's a place where the community meets.


00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.680
No offense to anybody else,


00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.640
I'm totally cool with other church buildings,


00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.080
and that is working for them.


00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.000
Praise God, God is doing some amazing work.


00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.420
But as a church, God has called us to meet in the community.


00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.680
God has called us to spend the majority of our time


00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.360
out in the community, sitting and eating with people


00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.280
who are just like us, broken,


00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.120
and then you know what we're doing?


00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.080
We're inviting Jesus into that table,


00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.080
and we're saying, "Jesus, please meet with us.


00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.480
"You've transformed lives before,


00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.040
"and you can transform our lives,


00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.960
"and you can transform the lives of those around us."


00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.240
So Jesus should be considered


00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.520
when we think about his ministry,


00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.160
and his focus, and his calling.


00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.280
So let's look at the second thing


00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.960
that we should consider when we think about Jesus.


00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.560
We should also consider the resurrection of Jesus.


00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.400
It's Easter Sunday.


00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.040
don't talk about the resurrection of Jesus, I probably have missed something,


00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.900
right? But why should we consider the resurrection of Jesus? If you begin to do


00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.780
any sort of studying, or if you're in this room today and you're like totally


00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.740
bored out of your mind because you're like, "Hey, there's no way that Jesus rose


00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.540
from the dead. There's no way that He is the Son of God. There's no way." Or maybe


00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.740
you're just contemplating that. I would have you reconsider, right? Once we see


00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.300
the ministry of Jesus, but then we also see the resurrection of Jesus, right? Why


00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.940
Why does it matter?


00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.780
Why does it matter?


00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.460
When you begin to study any other forms of religion,


00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.260
Jesus is the only one that ever came back to life.


00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.100
Why does it matter?


00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.240
Let me tell you the story of Jesus.


00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.820
I wanna walk through this in detail.


00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.500
So you're gonna see me kinda read some things,


00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.040
reference some scripture.


00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.520
But let me tell you the summary of Jesus.


00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.940
Jesus left his throne.


00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:02.780
So think about this.


00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.520
Jesus was the Son of God, is the Son of God,


00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.580
and he was the Son of God in heaven.


00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.360
He chose to leave a perfect place


00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.860
to come to a broken world for us.


00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:16.580
That's an amazing picture that God would leave


00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.520
a perfect throne to come down to the earth


00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.860
and to live a life like we lived, right?


00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.060
So he came down from heaven,


00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.000
he was miraculously conceived, he was born of a virgin,


00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.380
he didn't inherit the sin nature that an earthly father would


00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.220
because his father was God.


00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.460
He was completely without sin.


00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.900
Jesus lived a perfect life on the cross,


00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.700
or excuse me, on life, and then on the cross,


00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.180
he became sin for us, and he suffered horribly.


00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.080
We had a Good Friday service here in the Y


00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.320
with some of the Y members,


00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.040
and it was amazing to begin to reflect


00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.900
all that Jesus went through.


00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.060
And he went through every single thing that he went through


00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.620
was for us, because Jesus was innocent.


00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.220
But he was willing to take our place in this.


00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:04.700
So while creation, or the people there, were mocking him,


00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.140
he as creator was being spit on.


00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.200
He was being hurled insults at him.


00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.360
he was being beat beyond recognition on the cross,


00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.100
and then Jesus lifted up his eyes,


00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.800
and this is what he said in Luke 23, 34.


00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.840
He says, "Father, forgive them,


00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.140
"for they don't even know what they're doing."


00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.960
Question, anybody ever gotten a really bad beating


00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.000
and just looked up and said, "Hey, I forgive you"?


00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.040
Most of us probably haven't even gotten a beating.


00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.520
If somebody's ever wronged you,


00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.040
is it easy for you to forgive them immediately?


00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.240
No, we wanna pay them back.


00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.560
And Jesus' words after all of this was,


00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.360
"Lord, please forgive them,


00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.440
"for they know not what they do."


00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.200
That is a beautiful picture of who Jesus truly is.


00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.200
Then Jesus cries out this victorious cry in John 19:30.


00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.760
He says, "It is finished,


00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.920
"and into your hands I commit my spirit."


00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.440
And he breathes his last, and he gave his life willingly.


00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.440
And the reason why I say that


00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.560
is Jesus had every bit of power


00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.440
to pull himself down from that cross and say,


00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.400
"You know what, I'm not gonna die.


00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.540
"I'm not gonna die, I'm not gonna be sacrificed


00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.800
"in your place, in everybody's place."


00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.360
But he chose to willingly die for us.


00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.480
And that moment he did, the earth went dark,


00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.260
the ground trembled, and here's what I want you to consider.


00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.640
When we think about considering who Jesus is,


00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.440
I think a lot of times we need a perspective


00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.000
of somebody who isn't within the church.


00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.460
Because, I mean, here's the thing,


00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.840
most people who would claim to be followers of Jesus,


00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.340
wouldn't they say follow Jesus?


00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.660
I mean, that's a natural reaction.


00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.700
But the story is, is everybody that follows Jesus


00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.460
had a story before when they didn't.


00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.360
I have a story before where I spent six to eight years


00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.820
hating God, would reject anything that anybody told me.


00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.560
I did not believe in Jesus at all.


00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.580
Many of us may have that story, some of us may not.


00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.840
You maybe grew up in the church.


00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.100
But this person didn't grow up in the church.


00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.500
And so the Roman centurion that was standing there


00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.380
at Jesus's cross when everything went dark


00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.460
and the ground trembled, and here's what he says.


00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.220
He says, "I didn't believe before, but I believe now.


00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.200
"Surely that man was no ordinary man.


00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.100
"Surely that man was the Son of God.


00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.340
"Surely that man was the Son of God."


00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.500
This is a Roman centurion.


00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.680
One of the guys who was there hanging Jesus on the cross


00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.020
began to recognize this must be the Son of God.


00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.180
Three days later, we see that Jesus was laid in the tomb


00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.660
and he was raised to life.


00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.020
And then here's the cool part.


00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.540
He didn't just raise to life and hide himself.


00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.940
As you begin to study more and more,


00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.740
some would say upwards to 500 people


00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.220
saw Jesus after his resurrection over a 40-day period.


00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.580
And before he ascended into heaven,


00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.460
he said something to his disciples, right?


00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.220
"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations."


00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.460
We talked about this last week.


00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.940
Here's the interesting fact.


00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.500
Matt brought it up about, we call it doubting Thomas,


00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.400
was one of the disciples.


00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.620
He began to doubt that Jesus was resurrected


00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.660
and he needed to be able to physically touch Jesus


00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.140
and see Jesus to recognize that.


00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.860
and Jesus did that for him and he was able to see him.


00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.700
Think about this, these were the disciples,


00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.900
if you know the story, if you don't,


00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.260
you can go study a little bit in the gospels,


00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.940
but these are the disciples that left Jesus


00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.980
and abandoned him once he got arrested.


00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.660
You wanna know why they left and abandoned him?


00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.860
Because they didn't wanna be recognized with him.


00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:25.420
They didn't want to be brutally murdered like Jesus.


00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.060
So they abandoned Jesus and whenever Jesus


00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.180
was sacrificed on the cross and he was raised from the dead


00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.780
and they saw Jesus, they had a choice to make.


00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.640
Just like all of us has the choice to make.


00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.220
Is this truly Jesus?


00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.740
Did he truly conquer death, hell, and the grave?


00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.860
And he did.


00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.720
And his disciples began to follow after Jesus


00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.420
and they were willing to give their lives


00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.020
so that other people could experience


00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.460
a relationship with Jesus.


00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.140
Why would they do this?


00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.640
I'm just telling you this,


00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.660
I would not go sacrifice myself for some individual


00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.780
that truly wasn't God.


00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.740
Why?


00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.940
"Let them take care of themselves


00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.720
"because I care so much about my life."


00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.560
But these men understood that their life


00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.960
was secure in heaven and that Jesus was worth,


00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.120
sharing Jesus with everybody else was worth their lives.


00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.180
And I begin to think about


00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.440
why should we consider Jesus's resurrection?


00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.060
Because it has transformed the world.


00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.380
To be able to give us full access to God


00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.540
through a relationship with him


00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.080
because of what he's done on the cross, that is amazing.


00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.480
And then we see after these disciples were, right,


00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.480
emboldened after they saw Jesus's resurrection,


00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.240
and they were challenged to go out and share their faith.


00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.240
They shared their faith,


00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.440
and over 3,000 people gave their lives to Jesus,


00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.280
and the church began, and lives began to be transformed,


00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.440
and because they were committed to sharing the gospel,


00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.120
we stand here today.


00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.240
Jesus's resurrection is so important,


00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.640
because it means so much to us,


00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.280
but it also means so much to the people


00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.880
that aren't sitting in these chairs,


00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.700
the people that are around your neighborhoods,


00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.200
the people that are in your jobs, and in your schools,


00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.440
And anywhere you go that don't know Jesus


00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.560
and haven't got to experience


00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.320
a life transforming relationship with him,


00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.880
Jesus' resurrection is important.


00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.840
It's important to us and it's important to everyone.


00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.600
So I'm asking you today to consider Jesus' ministry


00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.480
and why he came and what he did and who he was pursuing,


00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.480
to consider his resurrection


00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.160
and even seeing the Roman centurion's response


00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.960
that he must be the son of God


00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.600
and even seeing the disciples' response


00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.440
that they were willing to sacrifice their life


00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.120
so that others could experience Jesus.


00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.500
Consider those things as whether Jesus


00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.680
is truly who he says he is.


00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.960
The last thing that I want you to consider


00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.000
is the eternal message of Jesus.


00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.740
This is in Romans 3:22.


00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.320
He says this as we ask this question


00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.520
about how we are made right with God.


00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.760
He says, "The righteousness of God


00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.600
"is through faith in Jesus Christ,


00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.880
"to all who believe, since there is no distinction."


00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.400
What does that mean?


00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.400
What does that mean?


00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.880
Basically, this is Paul writing, right?


00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.680
One of Jesus's followers, and here's what he's saying.


00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.520
"How are we made right with God?


00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.880
"By placing our faith in Jesus


00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.320
"and no one else and nothing else."


00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.720
By placing our faith in Jesus, no one else and nothing else.


00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.760
Notice what it doesn't say,


00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.080
and I think this is so important.


00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.480
I wanna dive into this.


00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.840
Notice what it doesn't say


00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.120
in order to give our lives to Jesus and experience Him.


00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.220
It doesn't say we are made right with God


00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.820
because we're good enough.


00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.780
It doesn't say we're made right with God


00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.800
because we're not being bad.


00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.720
It doesn't say we're right with God


00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.440
because we say all the right words


00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.280
or by not yelling at our kids, if you have kids,


00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.080
or I would even say this,


00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.400
he's not saying we're made right


00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.860
because we made it to Easter service


00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.000
without fighting in the car, spouses,


00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.840
'cause you know, there was a couple of you


00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.700
that were driving here today,


00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.580
And you said some choice words to each other,


00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.860
and the moment you got out of the car,


00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.580
you walked up to the greeters outside and said,


00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.420
"Hey, how you doing?"


00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.260
And they said, "How you doing?"


00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.780
You said, "Good, 'cause you're lying.


00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.780
"You're lying."


00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.260
Here's the thing that I love about Jesus.


00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.620
He says, "Come as you are."


00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:11.620
And if you walked in this room, perfect.


00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.260
Keep those halos over your head,


00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.500
and I pray that maybe God's been tremendously


00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.940
working in your life, but I would say most of us


00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.620
is probably walking in here not perfect.


00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.060
and he's came for us.


00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.280
So Paul explains being made right with God


00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.360
is by placing our faith in Jesus.


00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.440
And he says this is true to everyone who believes.


00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.720
And I love that word everyone,


00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.480
and I circle that because Jesus,


00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.920
we say he's exclusive in his message


00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.480
that Jesus is the only way to God.


00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.920
So that's exclusive, but he is very inclusive


00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.160
because he says that the gospel,


00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.360
the message of Jesus is for everyone, for everyone.


00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.460
So no matter who we are or what we've done,


00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.820
doesn't matter how bad we've been,


00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.360
it doesn't matter how bad your life is messed up right now,


00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.700
it doesn't matter how many people you've hurt.


00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.300
And what I'm saying, it doesn't matter.


00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.820
Yes, it does hurt those people.


00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.860
What I'm saying is Jesus can still come into your life


00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:05.860
and transform you.


00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.140
He can still come into your life and transform you.


00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.020
You are made right with God because Jesus is perfect,


00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.020
not you.


00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.340
Because Jesus paid for your penalty of sin, not you.


00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.860
That's the reason why we can come to Jesus.


00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.340
And this is the difference between religion


00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.180
and relationship.


00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.540
I wanna talk just briefly about that.


00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.500
Don't miss this.


00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.580
Jesus did not come to start religion.


00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.300
He came to reject religion.


00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.040
That's the Pharisees and the teachers


00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.860
that were looking for perfection.


00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.800
Jesus came to save us, to give us eternal life,


00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.740
to show us the love of God.


00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.180
Religion requires performance.


00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.520
Relationship is about Jesus and what he's done.


00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.460
And so I'm just gonna challenge you today


00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.020
to consider the eternal message,


00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:54.380
that you're not made right with God by your own works,


00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.760
but by what Jesus has done for you.


00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.860
I don't know about you,


00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.180
the reason why I'm saying consider this


00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.540
is because I know that I could be speaking


00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.100
to a room of people that are believers,


00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.340
that are following Jesus,


00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.440
but maybe you follow Jesus only on Sundays,


00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.820
maybe occasionally,


00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.180
and I'm challenging you to consider Jesus every day,


00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.260
not just Easter Sunday, not just on Sundays in general,


00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:20.100
But every day that his ministry, that his resurrection,


00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.500
and that his eternal message that he gives us


00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.180
is worthy to be remembered every day


00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.620
and to be experienced every day.


00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.180
But I'll just tell you this,


00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.080
the things in which I've learned as a pastor


00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.060
over these last 10 years,


00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.940
and as a believer almost the last 13 years,


00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.700
the more and more that I get to know God,


00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.500
the more and more I get to know Jesus,


00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.860
he is worthy to be followed.


00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.460
He is worthy to be believed in


00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.460
because he does transform lives.


00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.180
I'm evidence of it.


00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.020
I'm evidence of it.


00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.220
God has transformed my life


00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.620
because I used to be the person, again,


00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.620
that would persecute Christians.


00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.820
I used to be the ones that would make fun of Christians.


00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.900
And that used to be me, and I'm so glad it's not,


00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.460
and God reminds me of his love and his mercy.


00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.140
But I would also say this,


00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.580
that this message is for anyone


00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.900
who has not given their lives to Jesus.


00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.340
If you're in this room and you say,


00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.580
"Hey, I've never experienced a true relationship with Jesus.


00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.380
"I've never experienced that God's ministry was for me.


00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.920
I've never experienced that God's resurrection was for me.


00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.180
I've never experienced the eternal message


00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.760
in believing and being transformed by it.


00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.760
That is for you.


00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.140
Jesus is here for us.


00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.060
So as we consider today,


00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.260
I wanna just challenge you with just a couple of things


00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:31.260
as we go into invitation.


00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.520
We talk about invitation as a church.


00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.220
Invitation can become a ritual religious thing.


00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.640
And when I think about invitation every single Sunday,


00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.600
that every church has it and we have it,


00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.260
the thing that I ask the Lord every time,


00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:47.020
is Lord, do not let this be a ritual.


00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.260
Do not let it be something


00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.220
that we just go through the motions,


00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.020
we'll sing a couple of songs,


00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.020
you know, the pastor will preach and give a challenge,


00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.020
we'll close our eyes, acting like we're considering it,


00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.500
but really thinking about lunch, and then we'll go home.


00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.440
I'm serious, you may think I'm crazy.


00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.340
And some of you are nodding your head


00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.140
because you know that's what you think of.


00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.700
I pray that we don't come in here


00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.420
just experiencing Sunday morning,


00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.340
'cause this is what we do,


00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.840
or just coming on Easter because this is what we do.


00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.380
I'm praying that we are transformed


00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.000
by the message of the gospel,


00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.340
that we are taking home and experiencing God completely.


00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.260
So I'm gonna take some time to pray


00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.720
over a couple of different things,


00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.340
but at first I just want us to pray,


00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.180
and then we'll continue on talking.


00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.880
Lord Jesus, I pray that you open our hearts and minds


00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.760
during this time and remind us of what you've done


00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.880
through your son Jesus.


00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.800
Lord, just by sending him to the cross


00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.340
and Lord, that Him being able to take every one of our sins,


00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.800
Lord, past, present, and future,


00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.720
and Lord, you've placed that on Him


00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.480
that day that He was crucified on the cross.


00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.440
But Lord, I'm so thankful for the resurrection


00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:58.100
to be reminded that Lord, He has overcome death.


00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.140
He's overcome our sin,


00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.940
and that Lord, if we'll place our faith in Him,


00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.900
that Lord, it will transform our lives.


00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.400
And so as we continue to pray,


00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.440
I just wanna challenge you


00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.140
I want you to just think through a couple of things.


00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.860
Number one, I want you to think


00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.580
and ask the Lord this question.


00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.860
I want you to ask the Lord,


00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:19.040
have I been falling away from a true relationship with Jesus?


00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.460
If you've given your life to Jesus,


00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.060
this is those of you that would say


00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.880
you have not been making Jesus a priority.


00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.460
Here in a moment, I'm gonna pray for you,


00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.020
but I wanna challenge you today


00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.160
to confess to the Lord that you have struggled


00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.240
to keep Jesus a priority.


00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.160
I want you to pray to the Lord and say,


00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:41.740
Lord, remind me that what you've done on the cross


00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.520
is more important than anything in my life.


00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.760
Remind me of the power of the gospel.


00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.340
And so I just wanna pray for you if that's you today,


00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.280
struggling with trying to make Jesus important.


00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.120
And so if that's you today,


00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:54.960
I just want you to raise your hand.


00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.280
I'm gonna pray for you, pray for those who are struggling


00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.420
to just walk in their faith,


00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.760
needing Jesus to consider,


00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.980
consider Jesus every day of your life.


00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.560
And I just wanna pray for you.


00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.560
So let's take some time to pray.


00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.200
Lord Jesus, I know Lord that there's people


00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:12.240
that are just in this room and Lord, even myself at times,


00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.640
that we just need your power and your love.


00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.480
And Lord, we need to be reminded


00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.920
that what you've done for us is so important, Lord,


00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.480
that it's not just important on Sundays,


00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.360
that it's not just important when we need you,


00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.640
but it's important every day.


00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.560
So Lord, I just pray for each person in this room, Lord,


00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.800
that feels like maybe they've been putting you to the side.


00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.680
And Lord, that today they can walk out saying


00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.880
they wanna prioritize a relationship with you.


00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.000
Lord, I pray that you give them excitement,


00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.620
you give them direction.


00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.580
Lord, I pray that they come and they talk to me


00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.180
or someone else in this church and they say,


00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.880
"Help me prioritize my relationship with you."


00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:52.040
And as we continue to pray,


00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.080
I know that there could be a room this size


00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.640
on an Easter Sunday that somebody walks in this room


00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.860
and they haven't given their lives to Jesus.


00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.040
That they're saying, "You know what?


00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.280
"I don't know if I truly believe


00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.020
"that Jesus rose from the dead.


00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.680
I don't know if I truly believe


00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.540
that Jesus' ministry's for me.


00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.580
Here's my challenge today.


00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.580
Today is the day of salvation.


00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.020
Yes, Jesus came for you.


00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.100
Yes, Jesus' resurrection was real.


00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.140
And his life for you,


00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:24.340
to experience a relationship with you is so important.


00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.620
And so I just wanna challenge you today,


00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.100
if that is you and you wanna give your life to Jesus,


00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.180
what do you do?


00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.100
You repent of your sins,


00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.300
you ask God to come into your life,


00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.540
and you ask God to give you a new life.


00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.220
And so I wanna challenge you is this time I'm gonna pray.


00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.100
If that's you and you wanna give your life to Jesus,


00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.460
I'm standing in the back of the room.


00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.700
And the reason why I do this is 'cause I wanna give you


00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.020
the opportunity during invitation


00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.380
to come back and ask questions,


00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.540
for me to pray with you and talk to you more


00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.340
about how to give your life with Jesus.


00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.540
Because Jesus is worthy to be worshiped.


00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.500
Jesus can transform your life and experience a new hope,


00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.140
a new relationship with him.


00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.140
And the rest of us, as we continue to go through invitation,


00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.820
I just pray that you offer up worship to the Lord for today


00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.040
and for the Lord to guide you


00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.100
in your relationships with him.


00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:12.940
So let's pray.


00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:17.140
Lord Jesus, we thank you again for the hope of the gospel.


00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.580
Lord, that you change lives and transforms lives.


00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.200
And Lord, I'm just praying for the person in this room,


00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.540
Lord, that does not know you.


00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.740
And today, Lord, they are prompted to know you.


00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.820
They're prompted to give their lives to you.


00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.460
Lord, I pray that you give them the boldness to stand


00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.460
and to come back and to be able to talk to me


00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.720
about how to give their lives to you.


00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.900
Lord, what a better day for someone


00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.820
to give their lives to you than on Easter Sunday,


00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:44.580
the day that you rose back from the grave.


00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.260
God, I just pray that you move in our church


00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.780
and everyone in this room, Lord,


00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.900
I just pray that you lead them to worship


00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.060
during this time of invitation,


00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.140
to lay down their lives and surrender, Lord,


00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.600
their lives to you, no matter if they followed you


00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.920
in the past before or not, Lord.


00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.080
I pray that we leave out of here refreshed and renewed.


00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.880
And we just pray this in your heavenly name.


00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.720
Amen.


00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.300
(gentle music)


00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:16.300
