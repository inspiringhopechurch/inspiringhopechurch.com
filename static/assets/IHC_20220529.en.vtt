00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.170
Being discontent, anybody like where
you're not happy with where you're at

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:14.170
with your job or the car you have, or
the iPhone you have or don't have, or the

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.050
things you do have, and the things you
like, you found yourself, just discontent.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.070
You're wanting more.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.180
I'm telling you, we live in a world
where there's always something better.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:29.205
There's always something that
you don't have that somebody

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:30.795
else has that you wish you had.

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:36.045
And we consistent continually
are drawn towards that.

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:40.245
And so today we're going to talk
about how to have contentment and

00:00:40.245 --> 00:00:43.935
the value of contentment is found
not in the possession of things,

00:00:43.935 --> 00:00:45.045
but then in the presence of God.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:49.695
And so I'll say that again, that
contentment is found, not in the presence

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:51.735
of things, but in the presence of God.

00:00:51.735 --> 00:00:52.065
Right?

00:00:52.065 --> 00:00:53.325
So I think I said a little bit.

00:00:54.135 --> 00:00:57.254
But as we've been walking through
first Timothy, there's a couple of

00:00:57.254 --> 00:00:58.275
things that we've been talking about.

00:00:58.275 --> 00:01:00.855
We've been addressing false teachers,
which we're going to talk about today.

00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:04.095
Again, we've been talking about how
we conduct ourselves in the church so

00:01:04.095 --> 00:01:06.345
that we know how to, to live together.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.200
We know how to appoint leaders
and we know how to live as a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.820
reflection of Christ to others.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.120
And the last couple of weeks that we've
talked, I've been in first Timothy,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.300
we've talked about how to care for
different people, widows and pastors.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.820
And this week in the first couple
of verses, we're going to talk about

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.510
how to care or how to not care, but
how to conduct ourselves, going back

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.750
to that, um, as servants of Christ.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.080
And so Paul's going to address
that, but he's also going to address

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.970
false teachers who were teaching.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.220
Um, obviously false doctrine or false
teaching that was specifically to the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.090
idea behind trying to gain, um, material
gain out of spiritual godliness.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.550
And so some of us know this is
the prosperity gospel, right?

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.290
If we are godly enough, we'll get
material gain and that's just not true.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.580
And we'll see how this comes together.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.050
So I'm going to quickly go ahead
and jump in the text so we can work.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.210
And then we will, um,
see what God has for us.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.230
So let's jump in again.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.509
First Timothy chapter six, starting in
verse one, it says this all who are under

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.700
the yolk as slaves should regard their
own masters as worthy of all respect.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.120
So that then God's name in his
teaching will not be blessed.

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:21.150
Let those who have believing masters not
be disrespectful to them be because they

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.030
are brothers, but serve them even better.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.329
Since those who benefit from the
service are believers and dearly.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.180
Teach and encourage these things.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.110
If anyone teaches false doctrine and
does not agree with sound teaching of

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.820
the Lord, Jesus Christ with the teaching
that promotes godliness, he is conceded

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.050
and understands nothing, but has an
unhealthy interest in disputes and

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.420
arguments over words from these com.

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:51.365
Coraline slander evil suspicions
and constant disagreements among

00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:55.685
people whose minds are depraved and
deprived of the truth, who imagined

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:57.695
that godliness as a way to material.

00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:03.555
But godliness with contentment is great
gain for, we brought nothing into this

00:03:03.555 --> 00:03:05.835
world and we can take nothing out.

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:11.175
If we have food and clothing, we can be
content with these, but those who want to

00:03:11.175 --> 00:03:13.545
be rich, fall into temptation, attract.

00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:17.275
And many foolish, harmful desires,
which plunge people into ruin and

00:03:17.275 --> 00:03:21.565
destruction for the love of money
is a root of all kinds of evils.

00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:25.285
And by craving it, some have
wandered away from the faith and

00:03:25.285 --> 00:03:27.204
pierced themselves with many griefs.

00:03:27.475 --> 00:03:29.965
So let's pray, Lord Jesus,
we thank you for today.

00:03:29.965 --> 00:03:33.954
We thank you for this opportunity to
open your word and begin to walk through

00:03:33.954 --> 00:03:35.635
it together and to learn from you.

00:03:35.635 --> 00:03:37.734
And so Lord, I pray that each
one of our hearts and minds are

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:38.755
open to what you want to do.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.730
Lord.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.630
I pray that you'd guide me to be
able to, um, help teach this in a way

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.310
that honors you and glorifies you.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.420
And we pray this in your headline name.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.930
Okay.

00:03:48.225 --> 00:03:51.105
So the first thing we're going to see in
these first couple of verses is how to

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:53.144
conduct ourselves as servants of Christ.

00:03:53.144 --> 00:03:56.685
And so now we know, obviously
speaking, Paul speaking to Timothy,

00:03:56.924 --> 00:03:59.535
who is going to be speaking
directly to slaves in that time.

00:03:59.535 --> 00:04:02.565
And so you may be saying, Hey one,
we don't deal with slaves in America.

00:04:02.565 --> 00:04:05.745
And so I'm going to say, yeah, we probably
don't deal with that in the world.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:06.524
There still is.

00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:08.055
But let's specifically talk about.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.770
That time in which they
were talking about slavery.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.280
And then we'll come back and talk about
how we can apply this to our lives, but

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.370
Paul's addressing slaves during this
time, because as we begin to look at

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.170
this text, some historians believe that
have estimated half of the population

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.360
of Rome was composed of slaves.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.020
That's crazy.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.200
Right.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.989
Very very present topic in their day.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.780
So many of these slaves
became believers, right?

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.859
The gospel was spread.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:40.060
These slaves come to faith in Christ
and they had this new freedom in Christ.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.679
New freedom from sin.

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.900
But they're still enslaved,
which is a difficult position.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.789
So Paul was in dressing the slaves to
regard their masters as worthy of respect.

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.669
And so, you know what, this, this
is not Paul condoning slavery and

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.229
saying, Hey, this is great thing to do.

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.900
What he's saying is if you're
in this position, here's a

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.280
way to honor Christ in it.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.560
No matter what position they
were in, he wanted them to honor.

00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:06.664
And so some of these slaves, as they
came to Christ, many believe they may

00:05:06.664 --> 00:05:09.995
have been using their new freedom and
Christ as an excuse to disobey their

00:05:09.995 --> 00:05:14.555
masters, to not be godly towards them,
but to actually be revolting and again,

00:05:14.795 --> 00:05:16.295
to make this as clear as possible.

00:05:17.205 --> 00:05:20.535
Paul's not condoning slavery in the
fact of that, if they were being treated

00:05:20.535 --> 00:05:21.945
horribly, that they shouldn't fight back.

00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:24.915
What he is saying is if this is
the position in which you're in,

00:05:24.915 --> 00:05:25.935
here's how you're supposed to act.

00:05:25.935 --> 00:05:28.275
And so you may be asking,
well, why were they slaves?

00:05:28.275 --> 00:05:29.325
Why were so many people's slaves?

00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:32.955
Well, in that time, you know, today we
talk about money and then when we run

00:05:32.955 --> 00:05:35.715
out of money, while we have, we can
go get in debt to pay off our debts.

00:05:36.165 --> 00:05:37.515
Many of these slaves, not all.

00:05:38.975 --> 00:05:41.195
Would go into slavery to pay off debts.

00:05:41.285 --> 00:05:43.745
They would say, I'll work for
you for a certain amount of time.

00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:46.355
I'll become your slave
until this debt is paid off.

00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:47.405
So some of those.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.330
Voluntarily chose that because of the
debt in which they were in, some of

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.090
these slaves were slaves from war, right.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.050
So if they got anybody from a war
and they obviously brought them into

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.000
prison, they would enslave them.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.530
And so the choice was be a slave
or be killed as an enemy of war.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.780
I think I would choose slavery over that.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.170
Right.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.900
And then we obviously have
some of the bad right.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.080
It's which is people who were forced
into slavery and there's obvious.

00:06:13.645 --> 00:06:16.224
What I would say is for
slavery is a horrible act.

00:06:16.495 --> 00:06:17.604
It should not be condoned.

00:06:17.604 --> 00:06:18.505
It should not be accepted.

00:06:18.505 --> 00:06:21.114
We went through that in our
past history in America.

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:22.224
It is a horrible thing.

00:06:22.554 --> 00:06:25.945
And, uh, again, so, you know, the
Bible's not condoning that at all, but

00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:29.635
what Paul is saying is these people
were in this situation as believers.

00:06:29.635 --> 00:06:30.505
How do you handle it?

00:06:30.745 --> 00:06:30.984
So.

00:06:31.785 --> 00:06:32.715
Two things, right?

00:06:32.805 --> 00:06:36.555
Two things that he wanted them to
know is number one is, and I think

00:06:36.555 --> 00:06:37.605
this is important for all of us.

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:39.945
And I want to read first
Corinthians chapter six verses

00:06:39.945 --> 00:06:41.535
19 through 20 to talk about this.

00:06:41.805 --> 00:06:43.635
After we give our lives to
Christ, this is what it says.

00:06:43.785 --> 00:06:46.215
Don't you know that your
body is a temple of the holy.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.430
Who is in you, whom you have
from God, you are not your own

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.110
for you were bought at a price.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.150
So glorify God in your body.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.710
This is a reminder of the slaves and
to ourselves, that at the moment that

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.530
we've given our lives to Christ, no
matter where we live, no matter what

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.800
circumstance we're in, we are Christ.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.550
To the world, right?

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.290
So these slaves, whether free or
enslaved were not their own, right.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.620
They were to be used for the glory of
God, no matter where they were serving.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.730
And so Paul was reminding them to be
faithful, where they were to trust God

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.240
would change their circumstances if
he desired for them to be somewhere.

00:07:25.435 --> 00:07:28.285
And so that's the point where I would
just challenge you in this thought

00:07:28.285 --> 00:07:30.085
of what Paul's pushing them towards.

00:07:30.085 --> 00:07:33.295
And I think of Matthew 6 30, 1
through 34, this is something

00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:34.015
that was sticks out to me.

00:07:34.015 --> 00:07:36.685
Don't worry saying, what will
we eat or what will we drink?

00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:39.625
And this is speaking in regards to
where we're working or how we're,

00:07:39.895 --> 00:07:41.425
uh, what situation of life we're in.

00:07:41.425 --> 00:07:41.755
Right?

00:07:41.905 --> 00:07:42.835
Don't worry about that.

00:07:42.835 --> 00:07:46.345
He says for the Gentiles eagerly
seek all of these things and your

00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:47.475
heavenly father knows what you.

00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:52.725
So in that statement, if God needed
them out of slavery to go fulfill his

00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:54.105
mission, he would have taken them out.

00:07:54.405 --> 00:07:58.215
He left them in for a reason
to use them to glorify God.

00:07:58.335 --> 00:08:01.575
He says, but seek first, the kingdom
of God and his righteousness and all

00:08:01.575 --> 00:08:02.925
these things will be provided for you.

00:08:03.225 --> 00:08:06.375
So therefore don't worry about tomorrow
because tomorrow will worry about itself.

00:08:06.585 --> 00:08:08.115
Each day has its own troubles.

00:08:08.385 --> 00:08:11.445
So Paul is directing
specifically to be faithful.

00:08:11.445 --> 00:08:13.365
And we look at this first
verse here, he's speaking.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.720
To slaves who would be believers in
Christ and having unbelieving masters.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.140
This is key.

00:08:19.905 --> 00:08:22.575
Believers in Christ who
have an unbelieving masters.

00:08:22.575 --> 00:08:26.265
And so in which the way in which
they would serve would honor Christ.

00:08:26.265 --> 00:08:26.835
And that's what it says.

00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:30.315
So God's name and his teaching will not
be blasting, which means that they were

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:32.385
honoring and serving their master well.

00:08:32.564 --> 00:08:35.115
But then we look at verse
two and this is verse two.

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:38.745
It says, let those who have believing
masters, not be disrespectful to

00:08:38.745 --> 00:08:41.865
them because they are brothers,
but serve them even better.

00:08:42.075 --> 00:08:46.305
Since those who benefit from their
services are believers and dearly.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.280
So as Paul's addressing his slaves who
have believing masters, he's addressing

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.359
them in this way, that now, if I'm a
believer as a slave, and you're a believer

00:08:55.359 --> 00:08:58.599
as a master we're co-equal, I mean, so
you guys know this, it doesn't matter

00:08:58.599 --> 00:09:00.040
what position you have in this world.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.479
If you're a believer and you're homeless,
and you're a believer and you're CEO,

00:09:04.479 --> 00:09:06.250
you're still equal in the kingdom of God.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.300
So these slaves, they moved from
here to here in the kingdom of God,

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.189
but their position day to day was.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.020
And so what Paul was saying was you need
to be respectful of their position, even

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.240
though you may be co heirs with Christ.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.740
And so, as he saying, be respectful
because they are brothers or sisters

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.180
in Christ, serve them even better
because they would help their master who

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.280
influences others for the sake of Christ.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.360
And I love that because he's speaking
directly to this, this thought is, as

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.180
these slaves would serve well to believe.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.670
Masters, these believing masters would
be able to influence the kingdom of

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.030
God tremendously through the way in
which they serve them because they

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.290
were working together to further the.

00:09:50.699 --> 00:09:52.050
So there should be mutual benefit.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.600
And if you were here during the time
where we went through the book of

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.180
Ephesians, we dealt with this a little
bit deeper, but there should be mutual

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.040
benefit for the masters as well.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:04.110
If you're believing master to treat your
slaves well, um, with respect, right?

00:10:04.319 --> 00:10:07.350
And one of the things, as I began to
read about this, they said in that day,

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.550
it would be interesting during the week
they would work as slaves and masters

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.030
together, but they would come to church
and they would sit right next to.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.350
That's a cool picture to think
that that is, is how it works then.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.380
So what's the practical application today,
because again, you're sitting in the same.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:22.560
Okay.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.829
Maybe that sounds horrible, but we
know that slavery was a little bit

00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:29.730
different then, and some of it was bad,
but what could that look like for us?

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.030
I don't know about you, but has
any of you felt like that you're

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.960
enslaved to your job or even to debt
the person in which you're in debt?

00:10:38.025 --> 00:10:38.854
At times you can't.

00:10:38.854 --> 00:10:42.584
I mean, I'm just being honest because
if you look at it wherever you're

00:10:42.584 --> 00:10:45.495
at in your job, you have someone
in authority over the, over you

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:46.995
that can seem like they run you.

00:10:46.995 --> 00:10:48.645
Like you're a slave
and they're the master.

00:10:48.645 --> 00:10:50.055
I mean, and just being honest in this.

00:10:50.535 --> 00:10:53.234
And so when we think about it this
way as believers, sometimes we can

00:10:53.234 --> 00:10:54.734
feel like we are a slave to our job.

00:10:55.875 --> 00:11:00.735
And if you think about your, your, your
employee or your employer or your boss,

00:11:00.975 --> 00:11:04.785
they could be an unbeliever and being
an unbeliever in your being a believer.

00:11:05.115 --> 00:11:07.365
Sometimes you want to give
a half-hearted effort.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.750
Sometimes you want to act like, eh, you
know what, uh, they're not treating me

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.160
well, so I'm not going to treat them well.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.339
Right.

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:15.900
Which we start to justify ourselves.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:16.890
Well, they're not a believer.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:17.640
It doesn't really matter.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.060
Right?

00:11:18.329 --> 00:11:24.120
Well, just like Paul was a challenging,
the believing slaves to the unbelieving

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:29.189
masters is we have the ability to
work as though we're working for.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.840
Because we are an everything that we
do every single day, no matter what job

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.210
you have, you are working for the Lord.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.330
You're not working for put in the,
the, the blank of wherever you

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.950
work, you're working for the Lord.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:47.310
And so it's important that we work as
though we can reflect Christ, right?

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.480
So that we can lead other people.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.070
And hopefully our employees, our
employers, or our bosses to the Lord.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.950
But what if our employer is saved, right?

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.240
What if our employers saved?

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.080
And, and we're saying.

00:11:59.339 --> 00:12:01.740
Does that change our
position in how we serve?

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.920
Maybe we could start thinking, Hey,
well, you know, I should get a break.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.510
And so you may be asking this question.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.810
It, do you think that there's
believers out there that actually

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:12.329
have other believing bosses
that take advantage of them?

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.420
They do, because why my
boss is going to forgive me.

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:16.980
He's going to extend grace.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.140
I mean, he's a believer.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.439
He's got.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:24.090
You know, and so they begin to justify
why they, they do these things.

00:12:24.449 --> 00:12:28.530
And so I would say I've seen both of
these things happen in my lifetime.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.120
Both of these things
happen in my lifetime.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.380
Number one, uh, as I'm serving on
staff at a church, you'd be amazed,

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.980
especially when we had interns come in,
not speaking about Anna, Anna's great.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.330
We would have interns coming in and it
was something to this effect effect that

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.560
they would begin to think that, well, I'm
an intern and I'm working for a church.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:47.220
This has gotta be.

00:12:48.195 --> 00:12:49.455
You know, they're, they're
going to take it easy on me.

00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:51.975
And so we would set standards
and, and they wouldn't meet them.

00:12:51.975 --> 00:12:53.245
And so we'd sit down and
say, what's going on?

00:12:53.245 --> 00:12:55.845
And they'd be like, oh, you know,
just didn't want to wake up today.

00:12:55.845 --> 00:12:59.445
And it's like, no, like you're
taking advantage of the church.

00:12:59.475 --> 00:13:02.835
And so that's an example of a believer
taking advantage of a believer

00:13:02.835 --> 00:13:05.805
because, oh, well, you know, they're
gonna understand, but I've also

00:13:05.805 --> 00:13:09.345
seen in my own personal life, when
I gave my life to Christ, I started

00:13:09.345 --> 00:13:12.165
thinking, you know what, I'm working
for a non-Christian organization.

00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:12.825
You know what?

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:13.605
They don't care about me.

00:13:13.605 --> 00:13:16.635
They're not respecting me, but I
started thinking I'm representing the.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.960
And I began to change my mind.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.720
So I was the person doing a poor
job, and I began to change my mind,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.370
realizing that I could make a difference.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:23.820
Right.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:28.050
And so Paul's speaking to slaves, but
he's also speaking to servants of Christ.

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:33.165
That we are reflecting, no
matter our place and position who

00:13:33.165 --> 00:13:34.724
Christ is to the world around us.

00:13:34.875 --> 00:13:37.964
And if, and this is the thing, if
you're working for a believing boss,

00:13:37.964 --> 00:13:41.235
you have the ability to explain the
kingdom of God, because if they're

00:13:41.235 --> 00:13:44.954
a believer, a lot of times, those
people are making a difference and

00:13:44.954 --> 00:13:46.125
so you can help make a difference.

00:13:46.635 --> 00:13:48.944
So that's the first part that
Paul addressed here in these first

00:13:48.944 --> 00:13:51.675
couple of verses how slaves or
servants should conduct themselves.

00:13:52.725 --> 00:13:55.605
But then Paul begins to
change this challenge, right?

00:13:55.605 --> 00:13:58.905
He begins to now address false
teaching and false teachers

00:13:58.905 --> 00:14:00.405
who misuse the word of God.

00:14:00.645 --> 00:14:02.085
And so I'll ask this again.

00:14:02.115 --> 00:14:07.005
Why is it important as a church
to call out false teaching?

00:14:07.035 --> 00:14:07.395
Why?

00:14:12.305 --> 00:14:15.365
I guess you guys don't care if we call
that false teaching, why is it important?

00:14:15.365 --> 00:14:18.665
Why, why is it important
that we are teaching people.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.590
To figure out who's teaching
faults and not believe it.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.430
Why is that important?

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.280
We don't get led astray,
we're protecting each other.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.180
And so I would, uh, I would say this,
I mean, if you came here on Wednesday

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.370
night, we had a group come here on
Wednesday night, our mission team

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:38.150
from last week and we had some of our
small groups coming together and I

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.820
got a 1 29 and the traffic was bad.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.310
I started making this many
phone calls as I could.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.650
Cause we went in early and I said,
Hey, take an alternate route.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.849
What was I doing?

00:14:48.239 --> 00:14:53.069
I was warning our people from
being stuck in traffic led astray.

00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.520
Right.

00:14:53.699 --> 00:14:55.140
I was saying go down the right path.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.189
Cause you'll get there a lot quicker.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.099
That's what we do.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.880
We look, and we see, this
is what Paul is saying.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.000
Hey, there's some false teachers that
are trying to teach something wrong.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.060
We're looking here and going,
oh, we need to learn this because

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.110
we don't want to be led astray.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.520
We don't want to get stuck in traffic.

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:11.010
We don't want to be off the
path where God's called us.

00:15:11.219 --> 00:15:12.420
So this is where Paul's at.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.240
So he says this, he says, teach
and encourage these things.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.880
And the first thing he's going to talk
about in the first couple of verses three

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.250
through five is how to identify false.

00:15:21.035 --> 00:15:22.625
How did NFI false teaching.

00:15:22.625 --> 00:15:25.444
So we look at this first one here, it
says, teach and encourage these things.

00:15:25.444 --> 00:15:29.165
If anyone teaches false doctrine,
that does not agree with sound

00:15:29.165 --> 00:15:32.405
teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:15:32.555 --> 00:15:34.775
With teaching that promotes godliness.

00:15:34.775 --> 00:15:36.095
I'm going to stop just with verse three.

00:15:36.574 --> 00:15:38.285
So number one, how do we identify false?

00:15:38.285 --> 00:15:39.605
Teaching is one.

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:43.564
Their teaching does not match up with
sound doctrine or promote godliness.

00:15:43.564 --> 00:15:45.035
What is doctrine or teaching?

00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:51.045
Doctrine is teaching from God about
God that directs us to glorify God.

00:15:51.615 --> 00:15:55.635
So sound doctrine is found when,
what we're teaching matches

00:15:55.635 --> 00:15:56.955
up with what God's word says.

00:15:57.075 --> 00:15:58.365
Now, that sounds simple.

00:15:58.395 --> 00:15:58.785
Right?

00:16:00.785 --> 00:16:05.315
But there's false teachers that open up
the word of God and preach false teaching.

00:16:05.335 --> 00:16:07.595
So how do we know, let
me ask this question.

00:16:07.745 --> 00:16:09.725
How can you know that today?

00:16:09.725 --> 00:16:11.525
I'm not falsely teaching you how.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.150
Okay.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.670
I'm teaching from the word of God,
but also let's go a little bit further

00:16:18.939 --> 00:16:20.230
just because I'm teaching I'm up here.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.970
I have the word of God
open and I'm teaching.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:26.020
How can you know and make sure that
what I'm teaching is not faults.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:28.300
Okay.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.079
Promotes godliness.

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:29.890
That's the second part.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.170
And I appreciate you mentioned that
cause you're you're you're in it.

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:32.590
Yes.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.050
So it has to promote godliness.

00:16:36.015 --> 00:16:38.475
But you yourself need to read it.

00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:40.235
You yourself need to study it.

00:16:40.235 --> 00:16:43.035
So there's times whenever I used
to sit in service and listen to my

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:46.965
pastor preach, I just take everything
he said to heart everything.

00:16:47.625 --> 00:16:49.575
But as you're listening to the
word of God, and as you're reading

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:50.625
the word of God, you need to say.

00:16:52.245 --> 00:16:55.635
Aligning with what I believe
and what I know in the text.

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:58.875
And if you have something
that you're like, Hm, I'm not

00:16:58.875 --> 00:17:00.255
quite sure go study about it.

00:17:00.465 --> 00:17:01.965
And I've said this all along.

00:17:01.965 --> 00:17:04.275
And so I am that type of
pastor that says this.

00:17:04.484 --> 00:17:07.214
If I'm teaching something and it
doesn't align with what you're

00:17:07.214 --> 00:17:09.464
believing, let's talk, why.

00:17:10.305 --> 00:17:12.045
Because I want to make sure
that I'm teaching truth.

00:17:12.224 --> 00:17:14.204
And so something that God
reveals to you, we can sit down

00:17:14.204 --> 00:17:15.285
and we can talk about right.

00:17:15.464 --> 00:17:19.365
We can work together to make sure
that we're on the right path, because

00:17:19.395 --> 00:17:20.984
I don't want to also be this person.

00:17:21.015 --> 00:17:23.415
That's just like, Nope,
believe every word I say, you

00:17:23.415 --> 00:17:24.734
shouldn't, you should go test it.

00:17:25.275 --> 00:17:25.724
Why?

00:17:25.905 --> 00:17:27.944
Because that will protect
you from false teaching.

00:17:28.155 --> 00:17:30.825
And we're going to learn more
and more about that as we.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.460
So these false teachers were
teaching false doctrine.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.780
That was not from God, right?

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.060
It didn't promote godliness,
just like what Joe said, right?

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.390
It's it promoted self
promotion and self control.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.960
Um, and so their teaching didn't cause
people to come become more like, God,

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.890
I want to mention first Timothy four,
seven through 10, we talked a little

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.010
bit about godliness back in this, and
I wanted to read this scripture again.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.740
He says, but have nothing to
do with pointless and silly.

00:17:56.745 --> 00:18:00.135
And this is Paul's pointing to don't
have anything to do with false teaching.

00:18:00.645 --> 00:18:04.935
Rather train yourself in godliness for
the training of the body has limited

00:18:04.935 --> 00:18:09.825
benefit, but godliness is beneficial in
every way, since it holds a promise for

00:18:09.825 --> 00:18:12.105
the present life also for the life of.

00:18:12.905 --> 00:18:16.415
For this Saint as trustworthy and
deserving of full acceptance for this

00:18:16.415 --> 00:18:19.835
reason we labor and strive because we
put our hope in the living God, who is

00:18:19.835 --> 00:18:23.225
the savior of all people, especially
those who believe so training and

00:18:23.225 --> 00:18:27.545
godliness is beneficial for us to
protect ourselves from false teaching.

00:18:27.695 --> 00:18:30.825
We train in godliness
by knowing God more and.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.300
Living like God more.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.110
Right?

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.530
So these false teachers, if we look
at verses four and five, they're

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.410
teaching led to something and it
says, and I'm going to kind of

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.550
read first three and four together.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.480
Cause it says it goes together.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.740
If anyone teaches false doctrine and
does not agree with the sound teaching

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.640
of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the
teaching that promotes godliness, he

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.720
is conceded and understands nothing,
but has an unhealthy interest in

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.460
disputes and arguments over words.

00:18:57.835 --> 00:19:02.065
From these envy, Corleen slander
evil suspicions and constant

00:19:02.065 --> 00:19:05.065
disagreements among people who minds
are depraved and deprived of the truth.

00:19:05.095 --> 00:19:05.875
I'm gonna stop right there.

00:19:06.925 --> 00:19:10.645
So these false teachers attitudes
didn't match up with godliness.

00:19:10.885 --> 00:19:13.885
So I say this number one, it
doesn't align with the word of God.

00:19:13.885 --> 00:19:16.705
So that's how we can find out if,
if there are teaching falls, but

00:19:16.705 --> 00:19:19.975
to their life or their character
does not match up with godliness.

00:19:20.514 --> 00:19:21.455
What is godliness?

00:19:21.475 --> 00:19:22.195
Somebody defined this?

00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:23.455
My what is godly?

00:19:31.925 --> 00:19:34.115
Reflecting God's character
looking more and more like

00:19:34.115 --> 00:19:35.975
God acting more and more like.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:37.380
Right.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.670
Seeing how Christ lived, applying that to
our lives and becoming more godly, right.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:46.440
We're not to become God himself, but to
me more Christ-like or to be more godly.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.630
And so you look at their lives
and their character and the

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:49.470
way in which they're going.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.380
And we see this text right here,
these false teachers were obviously

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.790
not reflecting that character.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:54.990
Instead of being humble.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.770
These false teachers were proud and
interested more in creating disputes

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.220
and arguments than creating peace and
leading people to act more like Christ.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.720
So the result of their unspiritual
teaching created envy quarrelling

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.680
slander, evil suspicions, and
constant disagreements among people.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:11.910
So they caused strife.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:16.800
And I even started thinking about this,
these false teachers, the ones that

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.939
typically get sucked into falling, the
false teachers are your young believers.

00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:22.860
Or what I would say is
an immature believer.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.629
One that has not grown up in their faith.

00:20:24.929 --> 00:20:27.990
So what do we do every week that we
come in here and what do we do every

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.659
time we come to small group and every
time we have a discipleship group, we're

00:20:30.659 --> 00:20:35.820
trying to grow you up, teach you the
word so that you can know what's truth.

00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:37.139
And what's not.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.340
We've talked about this a lot.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.520
How do does our federal
government figure out.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:47.670
If there's any phony money coming in, they
study the original so well that it clicks.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.260
Once they see it, they know it.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.310
The moment they see it.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:53.850
See for us, we've got to study
godliness and apply it to our lives

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:57.390
so that when false teaching comes
in, it clicks, this is not godly.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.950
This person's character is not godly.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.780
It does not align with the word of God.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.530
So these leaders were trying to cause
division in the church for personal gain.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.220
And so we see this, the, this,
the, the third part of this

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.300
is the back part of five.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.180
It says they create constant
disagreements among people whose

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.990
minds are depraved and deprived of
truth, who imagined the guideline.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.810
This is a way to material gain.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.840
So their teaching was
motivated by personal gain.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:22.110
Right?

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.700
So how do we identify false teachers?

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.710
Their teaching doesn't
align with the word of God.

00:21:26.504 --> 00:21:28.785
Their attitude is not
line with a godliness.

00:21:28.815 --> 00:21:31.155
And their teaching is
motivated by personal gain.

00:21:31.575 --> 00:21:36.405
They believed that they could gain
something financial in their lives

00:21:36.645 --> 00:21:40.065
by using godliness right there.

00:21:40.215 --> 00:21:42.855
They used their religious
profession as a means to make money.

00:21:43.275 --> 00:21:48.045
And they begin to focus more on that
than they did on the heart behind it.

00:21:48.645 --> 00:21:52.155
And so for many of us, we may
say, well, it's easy to reject.

00:21:52.935 --> 00:21:56.835
Not necessarily because I'm telling
you all across our world right now,

00:21:57.135 --> 00:21:59.655
there's more and more pressure put on.

00:21:59.955 --> 00:22:02.745
If you'll just do enough,
God will bless you.

00:22:02.925 --> 00:22:05.415
If you'll just give
enough, God will bless you.

00:22:05.415 --> 00:22:06.465
That's what you're missing.

00:22:06.465 --> 00:22:10.514
If you don't do this, you won't
get this rather than pursuing

00:22:10.514 --> 00:22:12.615
Christ and pursuing Christ.

00:22:12.825 --> 00:22:14.175
Christ takes care of us.

00:22:14.565 --> 00:22:18.825
Christ provides for us and they
were missing this completely.

00:22:19.814 --> 00:22:21.854
So then Paul continues
on from there, right.

00:22:21.854 --> 00:22:23.354
He says to teach and
encourage these things.

00:22:23.354 --> 00:22:24.824
How do I identify these false teachers?

00:22:24.824 --> 00:22:25.185
Right.

00:22:25.604 --> 00:22:30.014
And we identify them by understanding
they don't match up with this, um, the

00:22:30.014 --> 00:22:33.074
characteristics that we talked about,
their right and their motivational game,

00:22:33.614 --> 00:22:35.594
but then he did begins to take this shift.

00:22:35.864 --> 00:22:36.614
He's like, okay.

00:22:36.614 --> 00:22:39.284
So they're trying to promote
godliness for material.

00:22:40.605 --> 00:22:44.985
Now Paul begins to take a moment
to teach on the idea behind

00:22:45.285 --> 00:22:47.865
what godliness should produce.

00:22:48.045 --> 00:22:52.875
And he says this in verse six, but
godliness with contentment is great game.

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:57.495
So we are going to learn why we
should reject the teaching of

00:22:57.495 --> 00:22:59.325
godliness as a way of material gain.

00:22:59.805 --> 00:23:04.245
And we should now learn from
Paul, how godliness is great gain.

00:23:04.275 --> 00:23:05.175
If we have Kentucky.

00:23:06.225 --> 00:23:07.785
Godliness is great gain.

00:23:07.785 --> 00:23:11.955
If we have contentment, because we
have to understand contentment is

00:23:11.955 --> 00:23:13.515
something that God desires for us.

00:23:13.515 --> 00:23:18.225
And so we're going to see your four
things that Paul begins to describe, um,

00:23:18.495 --> 00:23:23.595
that we can learn why we should reject
this teaching and accept this truth

00:23:23.655 --> 00:23:27.345
of contentment with, um, Godliness.

00:23:27.495 --> 00:23:30.855
So the first one is here in verse
one or verse six, but godliness with

00:23:30.855 --> 00:23:32.774
contentment is great gain, right?

00:23:32.805 --> 00:23:35.475
Being wealthy doesn't mean
it will bring contentment.

00:23:35.475 --> 00:23:36.615
Anybody ever found that, right?

00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:40.395
The more money you have, the less content
you have, I don't know about you, but it

00:23:40.395 --> 00:23:43.305
seems like the more money I had, the less
money I have anybody ever figured out.

00:23:44.475 --> 00:23:46.274
It's because you tend to
spend it a little bit warm.

00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:49.485
Um, I've spent some time
recently with somebody.

00:23:49.514 --> 00:23:52.995
Um, and, uh, as I was walking with
them, they asked for some financial

00:23:52.995 --> 00:23:56.475
advice and this is not many, nobody,
nobody knows here, so I'm not, but I'm

00:23:56.475 --> 00:23:59.475
just, I'm talking to them and, and I'm
laughing because I think they, they

00:23:59.475 --> 00:24:03.105
probably make like six times the amount
I do, but they don't have enough money.

00:24:03.705 --> 00:24:06.195
And I, I didn't, I wasn't really critical
of them more than I just walked away

00:24:06.195 --> 00:24:07.995
and just realized there's never a point.

00:24:07.995 --> 00:24:08.054
We.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.040
We do, we just don't right.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.650
And so being wealthy doesn't
mean that it brings contentment.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:14.580
What is contentment?

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.960
It is an inner sufficiency
that keeps us at peace in

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.340
spite of outward circumstances.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.310
I'm gonna say that again,
contentment is an inner sufficiency

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.300
that keeps us at peace in spite
of our outward circumstances.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.720
So Paul is saying becoming
more like Christ, right?

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.380
Godliness with contentment, which
is inner peace is greater gain

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.110
than our peace, which means we
have all the things we need.

00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:41.805
But we have an inward Discontentment
because this is typically what happens.

00:24:41.805 --> 00:24:44.955
The more money we receive,
the easier it is to live.

00:24:44.985 --> 00:24:49.545
And what I mean by that is we have all
the things we need, but we feel empty and.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.860
Because we're discontent or discontent.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.540
And so Paul understands this because
he said in Philippians four, 10 through

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:02.100
13, he says, I rejoiced in the Lord
greatly because once you, again, once

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.820
again you renewed your care for me,
you were in fact concerned about me,

00:25:05.939 --> 00:25:07.800
but lacked the opportunity to show it.

00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:11.490
He says, I don't say this out
of need for, I have learned and

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:12.419
I'm going to stop right there.

00:25:12.449 --> 00:25:15.120
Paul says he had learned to be content.

00:25:16.379 --> 00:25:18.629
Even Paul had to learn contentment.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:22.320
Sometimes I think we look at these
spiritual characters and we think God just

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.820
gave them an extra blessing of the spirit.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:24.780
And they're just perfect.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:29.669
He said he learned to be content through
the process of not having much and having

00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:30.739
much I'm going to read the rest of first.

00:25:30.739 --> 00:25:33.540
He says, I'm not saying this out of
need, but I have learned to be content

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.550
in whatever circumstances I find myself.

00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:37.409
I know how to make it with little.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.399
And I also know how to.

00:25:39.025 --> 00:25:42.655
Do with a lot and in any, and all
circumstances, I have learned the

00:25:42.655 --> 00:25:46.675
secret of being content, whether well
fed or hungry, whether in abundance

00:25:46.705 --> 00:25:50.665
or need, I am able to do all things
through Christ who strengthens me.

00:25:51.145 --> 00:25:53.365
This may be the first time you've
heard that verse in context.

00:25:53.365 --> 00:25:55.525
Typically that last verse
is brought out of context.

00:25:55.705 --> 00:25:57.745
The context is contentment.

00:25:58.045 --> 00:25:59.965
I've learned to be content I can do.

00:26:00.175 --> 00:26:03.385
I can have contentment through
all things with Christ, right?

00:26:04.605 --> 00:26:06.675
So I love the statement by Warren Wiersbe.

00:26:06.705 --> 00:26:11.625
He said this true contentment comes
from godliness in the heart, not

00:26:11.625 --> 00:26:15.495
wealth in the hand, a person who
depends on material things for peace

00:26:15.735 --> 00:26:18.165
and assurance will never be satisfied.

00:26:19.515 --> 00:26:23.115
And, and, and I started thinking
through this, I think all of us, I

00:26:23.115 --> 00:26:24.435
mean, let me just raise your hands.

00:26:24.585 --> 00:26:26.925
If you've been discontent
with your financial position

00:26:26.925 --> 00:26:27.615
at any point in your life.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.170
All of us had to have discontented before.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:32.650
Right.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:37.330
And that Discontentment sometimes
really distracts us from

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.490
recognizing what we already have.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.640
And so I started thinking
through this, have you ever

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.560
noticed the more that you have?

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.350
And so I would say that it seems like
every time I would buy something,

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:50.230
it seemed like it started like
nagging at me that I wasn't using it.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.510
If you buy it and you don't use
it, you feel like you have to.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.480
Boats are great examples.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.250
It's like, ah, we need to buy
a boat because we need it.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.420
Then you get the boat and then it's
sitting and you're going, I really need

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.010
to use that, but we don't have time.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.780
So I'm going to, okay.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.830
So then you start using it.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.750
Well, then now you got to take care
of it, then you gotta store it.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.760
And all this focus is put on it's energy.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.220
I'm not criticizing you have a boat,
but I'm just using that as examples.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.310
Trust me, I'm not all I'm saying is
that's an example of like, we just tend

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.540
to get distracted from things, right?

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.530
So it may not be a boat.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:17.220
It may be.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:19.110
A new iPhone.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.290
And once you get the new iPhone, you're
trying to figure out everything new on it.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:22.680
Right.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.480
And you've got the apps
and all the things on it.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.260
And I'll tell you this.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:26.940
I've got discontents sometimes.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.530
And this is funny.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.950
I put games on my phone and all of a
sudden I catch myself playing them all

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.450
the time and they're distracting me.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.610
And it's like, I got
to win the next level.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:36.780
And I'm like, what am I doing?

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.840
I've got to get like, so I'm
like deleting these apps off.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:39.990
Right?

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.649
So even small things like that,
we can begin to be discontent.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.260
All of us understand that,
but having more, been wealthy,

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.580
doesn't bring contentment.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:50.100
And that's exactly where
Paul is saying here.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:50.340
Right?

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.010
That, that godliness with
contentment is better.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:53.399
Right.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.810
But then he talks about verse seven.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.030
Your wealth will not last in verse seven.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:00.000
It says for, we brought nothing into
this world and we can take nothing.

00:28:01.875 --> 00:28:04.034
The statement that's usually
always made anybody ever see a

00:28:04.034 --> 00:28:06.135
U haul on the back of a hearse.

00:28:06.135 --> 00:28:07.905
And the thing is you probably
have there's a picture out there

00:28:07.905 --> 00:28:11.564
somewhere, but when they get to the
place to bury the person, they're not

00:28:11.564 --> 00:28:13.064
going to dump everything in there.

00:28:13.544 --> 00:28:15.165
And, and here's the,
even the crazier part.

00:28:15.435 --> 00:28:17.175
So I'm going to go a
little theological here.

00:28:17.294 --> 00:28:19.185
Do you know that your body
doesn't even go with you?

00:28:19.784 --> 00:28:20.864
It still stays in the grave.

00:28:20.895 --> 00:28:24.044
Now later Jesus comes back and
you know, our spirit obviously

00:28:24.044 --> 00:28:25.034
goes to the, to the Lord.

00:28:25.034 --> 00:28:28.245
He says, we get a new body, but even
our body doesn't like, so we can't not.

00:28:29.145 --> 00:28:31.485
Anything with us when we die.

00:28:32.025 --> 00:28:34.305
So when he's looking at this, he's
saying for, we brought nothing to

00:28:34.305 --> 00:28:35.835
the world, we can take nothing out.

00:28:36.495 --> 00:28:40.005
The only thing we can take out is what
God's given us salvation of our souls.

00:28:40.485 --> 00:28:42.045
And that's the crazy part.

00:28:42.045 --> 00:28:46.665
When we think about this is that our
wealth will not last when we're focusing

00:28:46.665 --> 00:28:51.615
the majority of our efforts on our
wealth, on gaining more and more and

00:28:51.615 --> 00:28:54.135
more and more and more and more and more.

00:28:54.375 --> 00:28:56.865
And all of a sudden you die who gets them.

00:28:58.275 --> 00:29:02.565
Somebody else who's gonna focus
on the more and more and more.

00:29:03.525 --> 00:29:06.735
So by focusing on wealth in
this life, we can miss out on

00:29:06.735 --> 00:29:08.175
what can last for eternity.

00:29:08.505 --> 00:29:09.315
So let me read this.

00:29:09.315 --> 00:29:14.325
Matthew six 19 through 21 says this do
not store up for yourselves treasures on

00:29:14.355 --> 00:29:19.125
earth, where moth or rust destroys, where
thieves break in and steal, but store

00:29:19.125 --> 00:29:23.025
up for yourselves treasures in heaven,
where neither moth nor rust destroys

00:29:23.025 --> 00:29:26.835
where thieves don't break in, instill
for there where your treasure is there.

00:29:26.835 --> 00:29:29.955
Your heart will be also, has
anybody found the bank where you

00:29:29.955 --> 00:29:31.605
can like deposit money for return?

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.450
We should create one.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.700
Cause I bet you people would put
deposit money into that bank.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.290
I've got a new job opportunity.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:37.889
I'm leaving.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.879
I guess.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:39.750
I, okay.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.440
Wait, wait.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.200
I've just turned in the false teachers
because there's material gain with this.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.090
What I'm saying though?

00:29:45.399 --> 00:29:46.379
I'm sorry.

00:29:46.379 --> 00:29:47.310
I had a laugh about that one.

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.490
Okay.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
So whenever you think about this,
how do we invest in eternity?

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.050
So somebody answered that question.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:29:59.040
How do you invest in an attorney?

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.450
There's not a bank out
there to deposit money.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.139
How do we invest in.

00:30:03.605 --> 00:30:07.505
Invest in people invest in
things that are going to make a

00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:08.675
difference for the kingdom of God.

00:30:09.755 --> 00:30:13.835
When you do it says this for where your
treasure is there, your heart is also

00:30:14.135 --> 00:30:15.575
when you're investing those things.

00:30:16.325 --> 00:30:17.135
You spend time with them.

00:30:17.165 --> 00:30:19.805
We talked about the boat or the
phone or the house or the car.

00:30:20.075 --> 00:30:22.985
When you buy those things, you invest
time in them because they're important

00:30:22.985 --> 00:30:27.305
to you when you invest your resources,
your treasures into things that

00:30:27.305 --> 00:30:29.555
will last for eternity, you tend to.

00:30:30.584 --> 00:30:33.554
Have your heart in those, you tend
to spend more time with those things.

00:30:34.185 --> 00:30:36.104
And so that's why it's important, right?

00:30:36.405 --> 00:30:37.064
To think about that.

00:30:37.064 --> 00:30:42.225
But how do we combat this idea of
Discontentment this Discontentment

00:30:42.254 --> 00:30:43.695
through greed or material gain?

00:30:43.844 --> 00:30:47.544
Does anybody know, get rid of a general.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:50.459
Give it away, give it away.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.550
And I'm not saying to the point of
like, now you don't have anything,

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:58.230
but as you give, it changes your
perspective because ultimately we talk

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:59.669
about it in the church, giving a tie.

00:30:59.669 --> 00:31:03.629
Then I, I think it's good to give, I
personally give, I think that makes a

00:31:03.629 --> 00:31:06.510
difference because what you're invested
in here and impacts the kingdom of

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:11.159
God, but the other 90% that we keep,
do you know that that's God's too.

00:31:12.505 --> 00:31:14.065
And that that is investing in things.

00:31:14.065 --> 00:31:17.695
And so we, we begin to think about what
are we investing all of our money in?

00:31:17.935 --> 00:31:20.845
Is it impacting the kingdom of
God with how we're investing that

00:31:20.845 --> 00:31:23.095
money or our time or our efforts?

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:24.055
Right?

00:31:24.055 --> 00:31:28.645
So acts 2035 says this in every way,
I've shown you that is necessary to

00:31:28.645 --> 00:31:31.075
help the weak by laboring like this.

00:31:31.375 --> 00:31:33.955
And to remember the words of the
Lord Jesus, because he said it is

00:31:33.955 --> 00:31:35.785
more blessed to give than to receive.

00:31:37.064 --> 00:31:39.705
So we obviously know our wealth
will not last forever, so we did

00:31:39.705 --> 00:31:41.084
not need to be consumed by it.

00:31:41.445 --> 00:31:42.344
We need to give it away.

00:31:42.344 --> 00:31:43.485
That will impact the kingdom of God.

00:31:43.485 --> 00:31:46.725
So the third one here in verse eight,
our basic needs are easily met.

00:31:46.875 --> 00:31:50.294
So he goes from verse seven, where
we brought nothing to this water.

00:31:50.294 --> 00:31:53.655
We can take nothing out and then he goes,
and if you have food and clothing, we will

00:31:53.655 --> 00:31:56.385
be content with it, food and clothing.

00:31:56.385 --> 00:31:57.584
That's the basics that Paul says.

00:31:57.584 --> 00:32:02.115
If you have food and you have clothing,
that shouldn't be all you need for.

00:32:03.135 --> 00:32:06.764
How many all know that doesn't
make me content at times,

00:32:07.784 --> 00:32:09.254
because I want something more.

00:32:09.975 --> 00:32:13.034
We want something more and
it challenges us, right?

00:32:13.034 --> 00:32:14.415
Because we want something more.

00:32:14.415 --> 00:32:16.155
But here's the statistic for you.

00:32:16.155 --> 00:32:19.125
As I begin to think through this,
um, if you have food and clothing

00:32:19.125 --> 00:32:22.605
and a house or a roof over your head,
you're richer than 75% of the world.

00:32:23.324 --> 00:32:25.905
So here's another challenge because
again, I start looking at these things

00:32:25.905 --> 00:32:28.034
and going, man, I didn't really need
to learn a little more about this.

00:32:28.185 --> 00:32:28.875
You can actually.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:30.930
Out on the internet.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:35.639
How rich are you, you can put in where you
live, your income and your household size.

00:32:35.639 --> 00:32:37.560
And it'll tell you how rich you are.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:42.960
Our family is 88% richer or
richer than 88% of the world.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:45.120
That's crazy.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.960
88% richer than, and again, they're
talking about in terms of salary

00:32:49.129 --> 00:32:52.080
and amount of family, things like
this, but like that just gave

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.170
me perspective and this idea of
whenever I think I don't have any.

00:32:56.085 --> 00:33:00.675
I become discontent and I begin to do
whatever I can to figure out and make sure

00:33:00.675 --> 00:33:02.415
I fulfill that contentment in my life.

00:33:02.445 --> 00:33:03.465
And it never works.

00:33:04.305 --> 00:33:05.115
It never works.

00:33:05.655 --> 00:33:11.595
So Henry thorugh said this, he says a man
is wealthy in proportion to the number

00:33:11.595 --> 00:33:13.125
of things he can afford to do without.

00:33:13.125 --> 00:33:13.875
I'm gonna say this again.

00:33:14.445 --> 00:33:19.035
A man is wealthy in proportion to the
number of things he can afford to do with.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:21.100
That's something.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.560
I think all of us can
take home with us today.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.590
So it's easy to get caught
up in the next great thing.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:26.920
Right.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.800
But we need to seek first, the
kingdom of God, we need to seek

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.090
first what God has called us to do.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:31.420
Right.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.800
And don't see godliness.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.180
This is what these teachers don't see.

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:38.590
Godliness thinking that it's going to
produce material gain, see godliness

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:41.650
because Jesus is better than any of that.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.660
And the things in what you receive from
him gives you the peace, not the material.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.580
He gives you peace.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:52.050
So last thing is these verses nine and
10 is the desire for wealth leads to sin.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:55.650
He says, but for those who want to
be rich, fall into temptation, a

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:59.010
trap and many foolish and harmful
desires, which plunge people into

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:03.000
ruin and destruction for the love of
money is a root of all kinds of evil.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.730
And by craving it, some have
wandered away from the faith and

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:07.650
pierced themselves with many griefs.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:11.550
So Paul didn't say, and I think this is
key, Paul, didn't say those who have rich.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:17.199
But those who desire for more
riches, those who desire to be rich.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.949
So look in the Bible, there's plenty
of people who were faithful to

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:23.860
God who had a lot of money, right?

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:24.730
So that's not what he's saying.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:29.889
He's saying when you begin to put
money, the possession of riches above

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:34.719
pursuing God, it becomes a distraction
to you now you've got it out of order.

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:36.940
So Paul is speaking to
those who never have.

00:34:37.694 --> 00:34:38.085
Right.

00:34:38.264 --> 00:34:39.134
That need more.

00:34:39.674 --> 00:34:41.444
And he says that these things are a trap.

00:34:41.685 --> 00:34:45.074
So go back to the statement of, I made
the quick phone call so that people

00:34:45.074 --> 00:34:46.424
wouldn't drive down the wrong road.

00:34:46.665 --> 00:34:48.915
I cared so much that they
wouldn't get caught up in traffic.

00:34:49.815 --> 00:34:50.775
This is what Paul is saying.

00:34:50.775 --> 00:34:54.645
He's like, I don't want you to
get trapped in the sinful idea.

00:34:54.705 --> 00:34:57.525
That material gain is
going to fulfill your.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:00.030
It will not fulfill your need.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.150
It is a trap to lead to
sin over and over again.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.040
It's not freedom, but it's bondage.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:08.130
It can lead to additional desires
and create idols in our life.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.860
So Paul has painted a picture of a
person who's drowning, who stuck in

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.330
coveting and designed to be rich.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:16.560
And he makes the statement.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:21.810
Anybody misquoted verse 10 before I know
I have, I misquoted verse 10 before for

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:24.000
the love of money is the root of all evil.

00:35:24.509 --> 00:35:25.440
You ever said that before.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.280
It's not.

00:35:27.029 --> 00:35:30.390
It's the love of money is a
root of and root, root, whatever

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:31.440
you want to say, whichever way.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:31.770
Okay.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:34.230
I know I've said it three different
ways and just take it for all

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.570
y'all of all kinds of evil.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:41.670
So anybody ever had a, a rut or
rut, whatever you want to call it,

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:43.529
and it begins to sprout out, right?

00:35:43.529 --> 00:35:45.900
If you don't cut, you know this
with weeds, you can just cut the

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.220
top off, but it's going to go back.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.090
So what it's saying is that he can
sprout off and they begin to create

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:54.600
these different desires and it
can lead us to all kinds of evil.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.210
It can.

00:35:57.135 --> 00:35:59.775
But it is not all evil, right?

00:35:59.805 --> 00:36:03.135
Having money is not all evil because some
will teach it in such a way that the only

00:36:03.135 --> 00:36:06.105
way in which you can be spiritual is if
you're poor, that's not a true statement.

00:36:06.945 --> 00:36:08.415
That's just the way
sometimes we've missed it.

00:36:08.415 --> 00:36:08.775
Right.

00:36:09.195 --> 00:36:11.445
So think about this, the love of money.

00:36:12.569 --> 00:36:13.879
Is not evil or something.

00:36:13.899 --> 00:36:16.920
The, uh, I'll say this in the right way.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.549
The love of money is a root of all kinds
of evil, but money is not evil, right?

00:36:20.549 --> 00:36:22.799
The love of it is so I'll
give you some other examples.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.330
Alcohol is not evil.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:25.020
The love of it.

00:36:25.049 --> 00:36:26.160
Drunkenness is evil.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:27.480
Food is not evil.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.859
So this is going to speak to more people.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:32.310
Food is not evil, but the love
of overeating of it is we can

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.660
say that about everything.

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.830
He's using money as a driving
force, to why some of the false

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:41.310
teachers were trying to persuade.

00:36:42.255 --> 00:36:44.385
And to see people to get material gain.

00:36:44.385 --> 00:36:49.065
And as these false teachers were
leading out and saying, Hey, be godly.

00:36:49.065 --> 00:36:50.355
And you're going to receive material gain.

00:36:50.505 --> 00:36:52.455
What they're saying is
give us some material gain.

00:36:52.775 --> 00:36:54.075
It bless us.

00:36:54.165 --> 00:36:55.875
And I promise you'll get material gain.

00:36:56.055 --> 00:37:00.285
It started deceiving people into this idea
that we really experienced today that you

00:37:00.285 --> 00:37:03.615
can receive more and more material gain.

00:37:03.615 --> 00:37:07.995
If you'll just do more or give
more, God doesn't need our.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.740
Now God doesn't need our art.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:12.790
He just doesn't need it.

00:37:13.779 --> 00:37:19.600
But what he's saying is when you pursue
him, it's an act it's a desire to give or

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.000
to, to be generous and to do those things.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.220
And does God bless you
when you do those things?

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.399
Yeah, I think he does, but it's
not because we're trying to do

00:37:27.399 --> 00:37:28.660
one thing to gain another thing.

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:33.100
So Paul is challenging Timothy
and the church and us to not get

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:37.210
sucked into the trap of greed and
Discontentment, but to seek godliness.

00:37:38.675 --> 00:37:42.425
And to receive contempt, seek
contentment in the midst of them, right?

00:37:43.085 --> 00:37:46.205
He says that this can lead to people
in this last part of the verse.

00:37:46.445 --> 00:37:49.205
Some have wandered away from
the faith and perceived appears

00:37:49.205 --> 00:37:50.555
to themselves with many griefs.

00:37:51.154 --> 00:37:55.445
I would just say this at times, we can
get very, very distracted by possession.

00:37:56.955 --> 00:38:00.675
And we need to, to see what Paul
is saying here is that it is,

00:38:00.855 --> 00:38:05.295
it can lead us into sin into a
place that is not healthy for us.

00:38:05.745 --> 00:38:08.595
So Paul started this chapter off, as we
conclude today, Paul start this chapter

00:38:08.595 --> 00:38:12.105
off with how we should conduct ourselves
as servants of Christ, right in our

00:38:12.105 --> 00:38:16.905
workplace with believers or unbelievers
has as employed as bosses or employers.

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:19.470
But he began to address
false teachers again.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:19.830
Right.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.620
And this idea of Paul's
trying to protect the church.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.440
He's trying to protect the church
from being deceived by these false

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:29.790
teachers who were trying to teach
about guideline is producing great

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:34.230
material, gain, not godliness producing
contentment with what God has given you.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.100
Right?

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:37.710
These false teachers can be
identified by their teaching,

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:38.720
not matching it with the word.

00:38:39.899 --> 00:38:44.669
The false teachers attitude towards, uh,
matching up with the godliness and their

00:38:44.669 --> 00:38:46.350
teaching motivated by personal gain.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:49.560
If you're seeing these things,
you can begin to test and wonder,

00:38:50.549 --> 00:38:52.169
is this teaching true or not?

00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:55.709
And that's just this challenge of,
if you want to be ready and prepared

00:38:56.129 --> 00:38:59.189
to build a reject false teaching in
your life, you need to be in the.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.300
You need to be pursuing Christ
individually and asking the

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.120
Lord to give you wisdom, to see
that to not fall into that trap.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.150
But then Paul began to speak
directly to anyone, including false

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.810
teachers who would desire material
gain over living a godly life.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.050
So he began his teaching, this
contentment with great game

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.180
godliness with great content.

00:39:19.435 --> 00:39:22.495
Love of money can easily distract
us from what God has called us to.

00:39:22.854 --> 00:39:24.984
And I think there's every
day there's people that are

00:39:24.984 --> 00:39:26.154
constantly being distracted.

00:39:26.455 --> 00:39:29.785
So how do we believe, uh, prevent
believing in false teaching test

00:39:29.785 --> 00:39:33.924
it, ask whether it leads to a person
looking more like Jesus, and to test,

00:39:33.924 --> 00:39:35.604
to see if that person is reflecting.

00:39:37.035 --> 00:39:38.415
So how do we even go into invitation?

00:39:38.415 --> 00:39:41.955
How do we even conclude and even talk
about how we seek our hearts in this?

00:39:41.955 --> 00:39:43.365
I think there's a couple
of things that we can do.

00:39:43.365 --> 00:39:47.205
Number one, just going back to this
idea of how do we conduct ourselves

00:39:47.205 --> 00:39:51.885
as servants of Christ is maybe you've
caught yourself being lazy at times.

00:39:51.885 --> 00:39:55.535
Maybe you've caught yourself not
doing your best at your job, or maybe

00:39:55.545 --> 00:39:58.005
it's because you're thinking you can
get away with, or you receive grace.

00:39:58.035 --> 00:39:59.835
Maybe this is a time to
just say, you know what?

00:40:00.405 --> 00:40:01.065
It's a time for me to.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.340
I asked the Lord to forgive me and help
me give my best, because I know that I

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:10.050
need to reflect Christ no matter what this
person does or how they treated me for

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:14.130
some of us, maybe we've caught ourselves
believing the lies of false teachers,

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:18.060
especially in regards to the idea
that godliness can produce prosperity.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.890
This is a great time to say.

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:21.765
I missed the mark.

00:40:21.845 --> 00:40:22.755
I believed it.

00:40:22.755 --> 00:40:25.725
And I fell for the trap and I
won't fall forward anymore and

00:40:25.725 --> 00:40:27.134
ask the Lord to help you in them.

00:40:27.555 --> 00:40:30.795
Maybe you've caught yourself
focusing more on money and

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:33.075
making more than you have been.

00:40:33.674 --> 00:40:37.095
And it's distracted you from what
God has called you in your life.

00:40:37.125 --> 00:40:40.005
You've treated Discontentment,
you've been beginning to put your

00:40:40.005 --> 00:40:41.805
trust and faith in your position.

00:40:42.975 --> 00:40:43.935
Not in the Lord.

00:40:45.075 --> 00:40:47.745
And so you may be asking
this question, man.

00:40:47.745 --> 00:40:49.695
I, you know, how many
people deal with this?

00:40:49.695 --> 00:40:54.045
Probably everybody I've dealt with
it in the, in the studying of this.

00:40:54.045 --> 00:40:58.425
I've asked myself this question,
what, who am I relying on more Jesus

00:40:58.845 --> 00:41:00.405
or the possessions in which I can.

00:41:01.975 --> 00:41:04.695
And I'm not talking about from a ministry
standpoint, just in my life, because it

00:41:04.695 --> 00:41:07.485
seems like I'm always discontented about
where we are financially as a family.

00:41:07.905 --> 00:41:11.355
The Lord's even brought me to a point
of asking God to forgive me, of relying

00:41:11.355 --> 00:41:16.095
on myself and materials things and
to trust him that I should pursue

00:41:16.125 --> 00:41:21.465
godliness, whether I receive nine houses
or whether I have food and clothing,

00:41:22.035 --> 00:41:23.235
because that's all I need to have.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:27.330
So during this time of invitation,
I just ask that you seek the Lord.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:28.170
What is he teaching you?

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:31.500
What is he bringing into your heart and
mind today to bring to him and repent

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.850
of, or pour your heart out to, or ask for
protection from false teaching, whatever

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:39.180
it is, ask the Lord to walk with you.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:40.980
And I'll just challenge
you with this it's frame.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.180
When we ask the Lord to forgive
us of sin, it's freeing for us.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.700
When we can run the race
that God has called.

00:41:48.645 --> 00:41:52.904
Without the sin that so easily
entangles us, he says he can give us

00:41:52.904 --> 00:41:56.175
contentment through forgiveness of sin.

00:41:56.654 --> 00:41:57.915
So I'm going to pray for us.

00:41:58.425 --> 00:42:01.545
My challenge, as I challenge every
single week, if you haven't given

00:42:01.545 --> 00:42:04.545
your life to Christ and there's, uh,
on your heart and mind that you want

00:42:04.545 --> 00:42:06.495
to give your life to Christ, you
have questions about what that means.

00:42:06.495 --> 00:42:09.105
Come talk to me after service in the back.

00:42:09.285 --> 00:42:12.134
I want to be here for you,
um, to walk through that.

00:42:12.134 --> 00:42:13.185
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:42:13.185 --> 00:42:13.755
We love you.

00:42:14.595 --> 00:42:19.515
And we pray Lord that everything that was
spoke about today, Um, brings about an

00:42:19.515 --> 00:42:22.515
opportunity for us to evaluate our lives.

00:42:22.964 --> 00:42:27.794
Lord, not to just be better people,
but Lord, to really just even get

00:42:27.794 --> 00:42:32.564
our hearts right with you in the area
of maybe our work and how we do that

00:42:32.564 --> 00:42:37.064
Lord, or maybe it's even in the area
of our, our, um, our heart towards.

00:42:38.504 --> 00:42:41.384
And Laura, or even maybe Lord,
it's our heart towards just our

00:42:41.384 --> 00:42:44.415
relationship with you and how
we, we create this transactional

00:42:44.984 --> 00:42:48.915
relationship where if we do all these
things, Lord, that you'll bless us.

00:42:49.694 --> 00:42:53.024
Whenever you promised over and over
again, or the full to seek first,

00:42:53.024 --> 00:42:56.475
the kingdom of God, anything that
we need will be provided for us.

00:42:56.984 --> 00:43:00.524
It may not be prosperous in
terms of what we think we need,

00:43:00.975 --> 00:43:02.384
but is exactly what we need.

00:43:03.435 --> 00:43:05.085
Lord, allow us to have contentment today.

00:43:05.085 --> 00:43:06.435
Lord, I pray that over every person that.

00:43:07.665 --> 00:43:11.145
Lord, I'm praying for every person in
this room or as they pursue godliness

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:14.295
to be more and more like you, that
they will receive contentment in that.

00:43:15.375 --> 00:43:17.775
Also Lord Discontentment at where
they're at in the relationship.

00:43:17.775 --> 00:43:21.705
Lord, I know many of us desire to be
further and further on in our relationship

00:43:21.745 --> 00:43:26.415
or maybe further to be faithful or to
be having the knowledge of your word.

00:43:26.415 --> 00:43:28.635
And Lord, I pray that they are
content with where they are, but

00:43:28.635 --> 00:43:31.065
Lord not staying there as well.

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:34.785
So Lord, we just lift up
this, this prayer to you.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.430
Lord, just help us today.

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:43.290
Continue to say yes to you and to continue
to invite you into our lives Lord.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.060
And so we pray this in your holy name.
