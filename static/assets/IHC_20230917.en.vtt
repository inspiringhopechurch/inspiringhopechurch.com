00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:07.070
We are, did somebody just yell woo?

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.590
Was that you?

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:08.620
Thanks.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.140
Really means a lot.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.210
Appreciate that.

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:15.690
Alright, so we are continuing
our Genesis series.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.970
Um, we are going through the first
11 books of, books, chapters,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.100
not books, chapters of Genesis.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.460
This is week three for us.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.110
We took one week to
cover all of chapter one.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.570
We took one week to cover
three verses, actually four.

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:36.504
Plus a lot of other verses that talked
about rest and then we are taking

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:38.694
this week to finish up chapter two.

00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:41.235
So we're kind of going through
a little bit quicker, uh, than

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:44.114
maybe you would expect when it
comes to the book of Genesis.

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:47.304
And so we're talking about this
idea of we're going through with the

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:51.555
mindset of seeing the key themes,
talking through the basics of it.

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:55.175
We'll dive deep based upon a
couple of themes that are in there.

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:57.485
Um, and then there's going
to be some things that if it

00:00:57.495 --> 00:00:59.214
may cause questions, right?

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.529
Questions about, like, let's talk a
little bit deeper about this or that.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:05.630
I always encourage you to get into
a, maybe an inspire group or, or

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.780
maybe just in an individual study
by yourself to study a little bit

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.890
deeper on some of these things.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.169
Um, because, uh, it's, there's, there,
honestly, we could take verse by verse

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:17.839
and dive so deep and spend every...

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.420
week on another verse and just keep going.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.030
But, um, for your sanity and mine, we
aren't going to do that every single week.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.870
We're just going to kind of do as best
we can to walk through this and gain

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.959
something, something each week that we can
hopefully leave, uh, transformed, right?

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.359
Something that we can apply to our life.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.239
Something that we can learn from
the Bible and see about God.

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:41.590
And so this week is going to be
good because we're going to see

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.570
how God relates to his creation.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.929
And it's kind of kind of be
a little bit deeper look.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.110
Um, and so again, uh, just to kind
of highlight a couple of the, the,

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.840
the things that we did learn over
the last couple of weeks in week one

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.049
in Genesis one, we learned, uh, who
created us, God, obviously He created

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.140
us, He created the whole world.

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.759
Uh, and then we learned what we are
created for to be image bearers of God

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.100
to the world and to those around us.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.020
And really that's going to go with
this through the rest of this book.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.100
And honestly, that's going to go through.

00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:17.495
With the rest of our lives that we are
image bearers of God to the world And

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:23.375
we are here to represent God to other
people and to reflect his character And

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:27.694
so we learned that and then last week
we learned about rest who likes rest.

00:02:27.694 --> 00:02:31.605
I love rest I mean like yesterday I think
I fell asleep at like 4 30 because a

00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:36.315
little later after all the soccer games
and I didn't wake up to like almost 7 P.

00:02:36.315 --> 00:02:36.575
m.

00:02:37.135 --> 00:02:40.755
Got up, ate dinner, studied
over my message, got the kids

00:02:40.755 --> 00:02:42.385
to bed, and went back to sleep.

00:02:42.715 --> 00:02:43.935
Still woke up tired.

00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:45.065
Okay, I need some more rest.

00:02:45.075 --> 00:02:45.944
So I love rest.

00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:47.424
We talked about rest last week.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:52.495
And really this idea behind, uh,
rest is an opportunity, God divinely.

00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:57.804
Created rest on the seventh day, uh,
for us to worship, reflect, repent, and

00:02:57.804 --> 00:02:59.394
celebrate all that God has done for us.

00:02:59.394 --> 00:03:00.765
There's a lot more to that message.

00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:03.255
If you're interested in either
one of those messages that if you

00:03:03.255 --> 00:03:06.225
may have missed them over the last
couple weeks, you can go online.

00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:10.354
Uh, we record these messages and we post
them online to inspireandhopechurch.

00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:12.595
com slash Watch, I think, is what it is.

00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:15.614
And you can find both those messages
to learn a little bit more about it.

00:03:15.915 --> 00:03:20.034
Um, but just to kind of give you some
idea here, we're looking at this book

00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:22.744
from the, uh, the view of the writer.

00:03:22.755 --> 00:03:26.285
Most of us would say, most scholars
would say, that this book was written

00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:31.605
by Moses for the purpose of the people
that he was leading out of Egypt, right?

00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:32.415
The Exodus.

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:35.825
Um, and he was writing for a purpose
to remind them who created them.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.880
What they were created for, uh,
he was doing this to remind them

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.540
of of the first creations, right?

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.040
The first of a lot of things Uh, and
and this was really valuable for them to

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.230
have to be able to To read and to know
about and for moses to be able to know

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.090
about As well as he was leading those
people, but it's also valuable for us

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.200
in our lives and how we reflect God, how
we relate with God, and how we honestly

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.870
just relate with a lot of our beliefs.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.460
Um, and so today we're going
to talk about three things.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.819
We're going to talk about the first
man, uh, and the home in which God

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.440
created for him in the Garden of Eden.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.010
We're going to talk about the
first covenant between God and

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.979
man, and then we're going to
talk about the first marriage and

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.070
how God originally designed it.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.710
Um, and so you guys ready to jump in?

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.160
Alright, so here's what we're
going to do because we always

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.230
are covering a lot of verses.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.500
I'm not going to read them all up front.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.590
We're just going to read sections and then
cover that section and then move forward.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.460
So the first one we're going to
cover is the first 15 verses.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.589
So that's what I'm
going to read right now.

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:31.580
So we're Genesis chapter 2.

00:04:32.385 --> 00:04:35.684
We're going to be starting in verse
4, it should be up on the screen here

00:04:35.684 --> 00:04:36.864
and we're going to go through 15.

00:04:36.874 --> 00:04:40.914
So it says this, These are the
records of the heavens and the

00:04:40.924 --> 00:04:43.374
earth concerning their creation.

00:04:43.474 --> 00:04:47.764
And at the time that the Lord God made
the earth and the heavens, no shrub of

00:04:47.794 --> 00:04:52.265
the field had grown on the land, and
no plant of the field had yet sprouted.

00:04:53.545 --> 00:04:57.275
For the Lord God had not made
it rain on the land, and there

00:04:57.275 --> 00:04:59.125
was no man to work the ground.

00:04:59.585 --> 00:05:03.475
But the mitts would come up from the
earth, and the water all of the ground.

00:05:03.835 --> 00:05:08.530
And then the Lord God formed a the man
out of the dust of the ground and breathe

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.289
the breath of life and into His nostrils.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.909
And the man became a living being.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.560
And the Lord God planted a garden
in Eden in the east and there

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.240
He placed the man He had formed.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.210
The Lord God had caused to grow out.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.940
Uh of the ground every tree pleasing in
appearance and good for food Including the

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.930
tree of life in the middle of the garden
As well as the tree of the knowledge

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.190
of good and evil and the river went out
from eden to the water garden Water the

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.279
garden and from there divided and became
a source of four rivers the name of the

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:47.265
first is Pishon, which flows through the
entire land of Havel where there is gold.

00:05:47.275 --> 00:05:49.405
Gold that the land is pure.

00:05:49.894 --> 00:05:52.965
Uh, Delium and Onyx are also there.

00:05:52.984 --> 00:05:56.575
And the name of the second
river is Gilhon, which flows

00:05:56.575 --> 00:05:58.244
through the entire land of Cush.

00:05:58.484 --> 00:06:02.224
The name of the third river is
Tigris, which runs east of Assyria.

00:06:02.505 --> 00:06:04.705
And the fourth river is their Euphrates.

00:06:05.085 --> 00:06:08.624
And the Lord God took the man and
placed him in the Garden of Eden

00:06:08.674 --> 00:06:10.455
to work it and to watch over it.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.560
So I'm just going to pray for us before
we jump into this first section here.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.120
So Lord Jesus, open our hearts and our
minds to your word because Lord, we

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.570
want to know you more and we want to
be transformed by your word and allow

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.020
it to work in and through our lives
to reflect that to those around us.

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.709
And so Lord, we just pray
this in your heavenly name.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.500
Amen.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.920
So the first thing that we see is
God creating the first man, uh, and

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.090
the first home in the Garden of Eden.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.190
And you may be a little bit confused, I
remember when I gave my life in Christ,

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:45.219
I did what every believer typically does,
they grab their Bible and they go to the

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:48.880
first book of the Bible and they read from
the front cover to the end of the cover.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.990
But if you're anything like me,
you read usually the first couple

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.430
of books of the Bible and get
bored somewhere around Leviticus.

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:57.960
And then you feel convicted and
do it again three months later

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.760
and do it again six months later.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.460
And all of a sudden you realize you never
make it past Leviticus because you're

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.860
always seem to get hooked up on just like
the boringness of some of that stuff.

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:06.139
Okay.

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:09.729
Um, so whenever I used to read
Genesis, I was always a little

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.984
bit confused because didn't God
already create Man in his image.

00:07:14.645 --> 00:07:17.335
Uh, well, when we look at this,
we kind of see what God did in the

00:07:17.335 --> 00:07:21.224
first chapter, when he began to
describe, uh, the first seven days.

00:07:21.224 --> 00:07:23.255
It was really that 30, 000 foot view.

00:07:23.655 --> 00:07:27.615
And now what we're seeing is a little
bit closer view of the in depth

00:07:27.615 --> 00:07:33.395
creation of man and the garden, uh,
and really even more so of creation.

00:07:33.395 --> 00:07:35.465
And so that's kind of what
we're looking at today.

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:35.880
Right?

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.979
And so we're going to just
kind of walk verse by verse.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.919
So in verse five, he talks about
that there was no shrubs or plants

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:42.950
that had grown up at this point.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.509
And he really answers the
question why that hasn't happened.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.269
And he says that there
was no rain on the land.

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:52.089
Um, and then he says there
was no man to work it.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.210
And interestingly enough, most
believe, when we begin to think

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:56.750
about this, go back to creation.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.190
He says he creates this, I think it's on
day two or three, he creates this expanse

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.900
of water between below and above the sky.

00:08:03.179 --> 00:08:06.369
Most believe, and again, you
know, we're sitting here surmising

00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:07.320
these things that we look into.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.669
Most believe that water that was
separated above the land, which

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:15.390
would have been quote unquote rain,
never came down until the flood.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.250
So, actually, the earth never experienced
rain until the flood came, and it rained.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.500
And so, interestingly enough,
that's not how God watered the land.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.160
He actually watered the land by
doing a couple of other things.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:32.180
Um, so again, He had, uh, not created
man to work it, and He had not had rain.

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:33.459
So what did He do?

00:08:33.765 --> 00:08:34.585
How did he respond?

00:08:34.595 --> 00:08:37.875
He responded with just creating
mist that came up from the ground.

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:39.505
We see that in verse 6.

00:08:39.505 --> 00:08:40.265
He talks about this.

00:08:40.265 --> 00:08:44.075
He says, um, uh, But mist would
come up from the earth of the

00:08:44.075 --> 00:08:45.615
water and water all the ground.

00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:49.795
And then the Lord God also formed
man out of the dust of the ground

00:08:49.995 --> 00:08:53.805
and breathed breath into him,
and he became a living being.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.220
Um, it's that moment where I stop,
and these are the moments where I

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.410
would just challenge you when you
read the Word of God that we read

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.700
it in such a way as though we're not
reading it to get through it, but we're

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.460
reading it to begin to visualize it.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.239
And in this moment, as I was reading
this this week, and I was visualizing

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:15.420
God creating this man, the first man, and
interestingly enough, again, study, study

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.820
the Bible, I was doing this in my studies,
he never calls him Adam until later on.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.330
Like, several chapters later, he calls him
the man, the man, which honestly, I think

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.160
we like being called the man, right guys?

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.460
Like, we like to be the man,
and that's what God called him.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.650
But he began to form
this man out of the dust.

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:35.840
And just think about this human
being being created, and then

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.090
God breathing life into him.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.510
See, now...

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.530
Adam, or the, the man, uh, never
was able to be a baby, right?

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.240
He never experienced the baby.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.930
And there's a lot of babies in this
room, and I'm thankful for those.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.719
But you guys understand this,
there's a lot of newness with babies.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:58.249
Well, for Adam, or for the first man,
he was a full human, a full creation,

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.380
a full adult, if we would look at this.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.060
But I just begin to think it just about
creation, and those of you who have

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:09.120
had kids, the moment that I saw my
children come into the world, Change

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.850
my life and my perspective about God.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.310
And I look at this same situation.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.090
And again, you may not have had
that experience and that's okay.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.570
But I look at this experience
and I think of that same thing.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.840
And I think about how it's transformed
my life to see my kids born.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.939
Because that is God.

00:10:24.169 --> 00:10:26.554
And there's nothing else
that could have created that.

00:10:27.075 --> 00:10:31.965
And I look and see that God created the
first man, and He breathed life into him.

00:10:32.255 --> 00:10:36.255
And I think that's just a reminder to
us of how beautiful it is to know that

00:10:36.274 --> 00:10:39.344
God, our Creator, breathed life into us.

00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:43.885
And that breath that we have, every breath
that you breathe every day is from God.

00:10:44.524 --> 00:10:47.745
And He gives you that breath, we're
gonna learn later, for a purpose.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.380
For a purpose.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.870
So if you haven't stopped breathing, God
is saying, I am not done with you yet.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.910
Keep breathing and keep
living and keep working.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.460
Okay?

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.920
And so we see that, right?

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.710
That God says, Okay, um, there's now mist
and there's now a man to be able to be

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.249
formed so that he can work the garden.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.730
But where's the man gonna go?

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:08.500
And so he, now he creates this place.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.190
And we see this in verse eight, and he
plants this garden in Eden in the east.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.869
And he placed the man that he
formed there in this garden.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.800
And this becomes his first home.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.660
And when we look at the word Eden,
um, it's defined as this, as a

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.250
delight, a place of much water,
which would suggest a paradise that

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.260
God had created for man to live in.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:30.450
Right?

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.189
The first home.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.045
Um, and most of us, Again, maybe
wrong, but most of us first home

00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:37.775
probably didn't look much like Eden.

00:11:37.795 --> 00:11:39.115
It probably looked like a dump.

00:11:39.435 --> 00:11:40.505
I remember ours.

00:11:40.695 --> 00:11:44.085
I remember moving into our first
home and in the winter it felt

00:11:44.085 --> 00:11:47.255
like for some reason the air
conditioner was on under our floor.

00:11:47.255 --> 00:11:49.275
Well, we realized there was no insulation.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.730
And it was cold from about the floor
to the top of our knees, and it

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.290
felt like it was about 30 degrees.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.910
Uh, and there was a lot of
other issues with our home.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:01.410
So we didn't live in a paradise, but
Adam was born and placed into a paradise.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.259
And that's an awesome thing, right?

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.909
And we see the things that
he said that grew, right?

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.300
He says there was things that
grew, including trees, things

00:12:08.309 --> 00:12:10.949
that were pleasing in appearance,
things that were good for food.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.020
And I stopped right
then and realized this.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.590
God is providing for Adam.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.240
He didn't just create him
and say, figure it out.

00:12:17.685 --> 00:12:20.635
He created this place that was beautiful.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.670
And he created a place that would
provide food or nourishment, what

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.200
he needed to live and exist, right?

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.250
Um, and then he talks about these two
trees, which become a curse later,

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.599
that, right, we talk about these trees.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.000
But he talks about the tree of life
in the middle of the garden, and

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.630
then the tree of good and evil.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.989
And we're going to talk more
about this here in just a minute.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:43.010
Um, but then he jumps into verses
10 through 14, and, uh, he begins to

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.790
reference rivers, and things that I
probably didn't correctly say, but I

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.190
acted like I knew what I was saying.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.800
Um, and all these rivers and, and things
that float in to be able to water those

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:57.010
trees, those, those things that were
created in this Garden of Eden, right?

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.620
Uh, and, and most, again, most
people have studied, and like,

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.130
hey, where was this garden at?

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.180
And they begin to do all these
coordinates, and taking these

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.340
places, and some of the similar
names, and honestly, we don't know.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.060
I mean, you, you can guess all day long.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.840
But nobody's ever found that place,
because actually, if you'll go to, um,

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.580
the, and we'll learn about it soon, is.

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:18.645
After Adam and Eve sinned and they were
placed out of the garden, it actually

00:13:18.645 --> 00:13:24.735
talks about God placing basically,
um, an angel in place to guard it.

00:13:24.935 --> 00:13:26.364
So nobody's going to find it, by the way.

00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:27.325
They're just not going to find it.

00:13:27.325 --> 00:13:29.875
But most people want to know
where that was, but we don't

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:31.585
have to know, um, with this.

00:13:31.585 --> 00:13:32.905
But we see verse 15 here.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:38.125
Uh, basically it says the Lord
took Adam and he placed him in this

00:13:38.145 --> 00:13:40.265
beautiful garden to do two things.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:41.310
Don't miss this.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.860
He says, he placed him in this
garden to work it and watch over it.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.850
And I stopped for a minute whenever
I studied this and I went, wait, God,

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.580
God had Adam work before sin came.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.130
Because you always say like when sin
came into the world, there was two

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.750
curses, women, you got a hard labor.

00:14:00.185 --> 00:14:03.165
That stinks for you, but man, you're gonna
work the ground and it's gonna be hard.

00:14:03.515 --> 00:14:04.895
But we still had to work.

00:14:04.915 --> 00:14:08.525
Like, we see this, that Adam still
had to work even in this beautiful

00:14:08.525 --> 00:14:10.705
creation before the fall, right?

00:14:11.185 --> 00:14:13.285
Um, and I, I think that
was interesting, right?

00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:17.945
That God provided, but he provided,
provided Adam to work the ground.

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:21.404
Um, but most likely he enjoyed
his work with this, right?

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.550
Um, and so I think this is just a good
reminder for us that God has designed work

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:33.250
for us, our abilities and the things that
God has given us to use us, the spirit

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.809
of God inside of us, to, to be God's
reflection to those around us, right?

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.439
To be faithful stewards.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:43.040
Um, and so that's kind of where we
see the first man in the first home.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.440
So everything's still looking good.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.080
I still look at this when we're
going into Genesis, Genesis chapter

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.390
one, the first part of Genesis
chapter two, everything's going good.

00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:54.425
But then we see God now create
this covenant with man, right?

00:14:54.425 --> 00:14:57.605
Between him and man in verses 16 and 17.

00:14:57.625 --> 00:14:58.365
So let's read that.

00:14:58.915 --> 00:15:03.385
We see, we see where he says, And the
Lord God commanded the man, You are

00:15:03.385 --> 00:15:09.305
free to eat from any of the tree of
the garden, but you must not eat from

00:15:09.305 --> 00:15:10.965
the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:14.895
For the day that you eat from
it, you will certainly die.

00:15:15.365 --> 00:15:18.655
And then the Lord God said, it
is not good for man to be alone.

00:15:19.325 --> 00:15:22.375
He says, I will, uh, and I'll stop
there, those two verses there.

00:15:22.735 --> 00:15:24.704
So this first covenant, when
we think about this, was

00:15:24.705 --> 00:15:26.315
between God and man, obviously.

00:15:26.565 --> 00:15:29.385
And when we think about a word
covenant, we think about it this way.

00:15:29.414 --> 00:15:34.654
It's a binding arrangement between
two people, um, or more people, um,

00:15:34.724 --> 00:15:36.214
that governs their relationship.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.710
So it's a binding agreement or an
arrangement between two or more people

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.080
that governs their relationship.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.380
Uh, and we see here where it
says that God commanded the man.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:51.529
And so the question is, did Adam
have a say in this covenant?

00:15:52.645 --> 00:15:58.295
He really, he didn't, but in essence,
his creator created this for a reason,

00:15:58.635 --> 00:16:01.305
and so Adam obviously accepted it.

00:16:02.005 --> 00:16:04.505
But he says that he commanded
it, and that God's the one that

00:16:04.514 --> 00:16:06.035
made the terms of the agreement.

00:16:06.035 --> 00:16:08.924
And so, there's a moment,
guys, where again, I think it's

00:16:08.925 --> 00:16:10.274
important to ask these questions.

00:16:10.425 --> 00:16:13.575
Why is it okay for God
not to give Adam a say?

00:16:14.735 --> 00:16:16.805
I mean, Adam's committing
to this commandment.

00:16:16.815 --> 00:16:18.205
Like, why do I have to follow this?

00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:19.795
Like, shouldn't I have a say in it?

00:16:20.165 --> 00:16:22.554
And I begin to think there's a bigger
picture of this that we're going to build

00:16:22.555 --> 00:16:24.705
out over the several weeks that comes up.

00:16:25.034 --> 00:16:27.745
But it makes a little bit of
sense because we understand

00:16:28.074 --> 00:16:29.574
that God is God and we are not.

00:16:29.585 --> 00:16:37.485
It also makes sense to this that God,
His perspective on life is unlimited.

00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:38.725
Unlimited.

00:16:38.925 --> 00:16:40.645
He can see everything.

00:16:40.645 --> 00:16:43.055
He can see the potential.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.250
The potential struggles, the potential,
um, things that could come wrong,

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.130
but our perspective is limited.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.810
And, and, and here's how I know this.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.350
Right now, you do not have the ability to
see anything else other than this room.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.539
This is your perspective, but
God's perspective sees every single

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.710
thing that's going on across the
whole world, the whole world.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.290
And that means that if God's
perspective is not limited and he

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.060
begins to give this commandment.

00:17:09.465 --> 00:17:14.695
This covenant that he begins to make
with Adam, to not eat of one tree, but

00:17:14.695 --> 00:17:17.105
he can have the tree of anything else.

00:17:18.185 --> 00:17:20.475
For Adam, he's probably thinking,
God's probably looking out for me.

00:17:20.705 --> 00:17:24.685
God's probably got a better
understanding of this than I do, right?

00:17:24.825 --> 00:17:26.735
And so his perspective's not limited.

00:17:26.735 --> 00:17:27.925
And I think we need to hear this.

00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:31.035
I'm gonna make this statement, this is a
quote that I wrote down, and then I was

00:17:31.035 --> 00:17:35.474
like, man, I need to hear this, I need to
post this, on top of my, like, mirror that

00:17:35.475 --> 00:17:37.485
I see every single morning that I wake up.

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:40.085
Um, here's what I wrote down.

00:17:40.635 --> 00:17:46.055
And some of our greatest disappointments
can become, I'm going to say this

00:17:46.305 --> 00:17:50.665
differently because I'm struggling to
read it because I hate to hear this.

00:17:50.985 --> 00:17:55.294
And some of our greatest disappointments
can be God's divine perspective.

00:17:55.544 --> 00:17:56.185
I'm going to say this again.

00:17:56.365 --> 00:18:01.275
And some of our greatest disappointments
can be God's divine perspective.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.770
It's hard to hear that sometimes,
um, because we want what we want

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.720
and we think we know what's best.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.470
Um, and so we have the privilege though,
and I think this is the beautiful thing.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.680
We have the privilege and the
chance to know our creator.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.139
And I think that's a big
responsibility to know this, that

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.990
our creator knows what's best for us.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.890
And with this command, Adam.

00:18:23.425 --> 00:18:25.345
So, only requirement is obedience.

00:18:25.425 --> 00:18:27.255
And that obedience would provide what?

00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:28.705
Why would we obey God?

00:18:28.715 --> 00:18:30.115
Why would Adam obey God?

00:18:30.115 --> 00:18:33.875
That obedience would provide
Adam with Eve, eventually, we'll

00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:34.725
talk about that in just a minute.

00:18:34.995 --> 00:18:38.554
God's fellowship, God's
safety, and God's providence.

00:18:39.064 --> 00:18:40.545
Those are all blessings.

00:18:40.975 --> 00:18:48.605
So for Adam to obey God in this covenant,
to eat of everything else but one tree,

00:18:49.245 --> 00:18:50.845
he would receive all those things.

00:18:51.315 --> 00:18:51.785
God's blessing.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:59.450
It seems good, but, but how many of
us can walk into a room and somebody

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.920
tell us we can't have one thing in
that room and it makes us want it?

00:19:02.259 --> 00:19:03.409
Anybody ever seen a kid?

00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:05.420
We actually, let me just
give you this great example.

00:19:06.659 --> 00:19:11.159
This morning as we're setting up, Ashley
and Alex come in with their son Judah and

00:19:11.159 --> 00:19:12.649
he goes right over to the water fountain.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.850
And I said, you know, it's kind of
funny cause they're like, no, no,

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:15.580
get away from the water fountain.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.370
Don't play in the water fountain.

00:19:16.639 --> 00:19:19.420
It's always the one thing in the room that
the kids can't play with that you tell

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.089
them no, that they keep going back to.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:21.560
Is that right?

00:19:22.949 --> 00:19:24.489
It's the same thing in our adult life.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.959
So we're told we can't touch it.

00:19:25.969 --> 00:19:26.750
What do we want to do?

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.989
I want to touch it.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.449
So when we think about this,
God makes this commandment.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.529
Adam's like, cool.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.550
You have your best, you know,
my best interest in mind.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.189
That's great.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.200
But it's always sitting there.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.680
And we're going to talk about that
just even a little bit more, right?

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.390
And so I think that's hard.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.250
He talks about this, right?

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.870
The tree of knowledge.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.129
Let's just talk about
this, or not knowledge.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:47.920
The tree of life.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.859
What does the tree of life give Adam?

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.470
The tree of life gives Adam immortality.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.910
To live forever in
eternity with God in Eden.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.300
He gives that to him if he
eats of the tree of life and

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.240
the rest of the things there.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.940
But the tree of knowledge of
good and evil gives him death.

00:20:05.429 --> 00:20:07.119
But it still seems enticing to him.

00:20:07.529 --> 00:20:10.019
And we're not even to the fall yet,
and I keep kind of getting there, and

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:13.459
that's chapter three, but it's this
thing that's constantly sitting over

00:20:13.459 --> 00:20:15.779
there in the back of their minds.

00:20:15.779 --> 00:20:18.299
And so the big question is, this is
the big question that I had to ask, and

00:20:18.299 --> 00:20:19.489
this is the big question everybody asks.

00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:23.859
If it was so bad, if it was something
that Adam shouldn't touch, why

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.229
would God place it in the garden?

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.979
Why would He just not place it there?

00:20:28.809 --> 00:20:30.110
Solves all the problems, right?

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.269
Solves all the problems.

00:20:31.809 --> 00:20:33.370
Well, deep dive, just think about it here.

00:20:34.249 --> 00:20:38.480
If the choice is removed, to follow God.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.050
If the choice is removed to love God,
believe God, to trust God, if that

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.139
choice is removed, we become robots.

00:20:46.169 --> 00:20:50.320
We become forced servants.

00:20:50.899 --> 00:20:54.950
We become something that I would just
tell you I would hate to be forced.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.350
Nobody likes to be told that they
have to, no matter what, you're

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.550
gonna be forced to do this.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:00.639
We get a choice.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.300
So that tree placed the opportunity.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.980
This is the first time
that God gave man human.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.180
A choice.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.090
Why is a choice matter?

00:21:10.129 --> 00:21:11.990
Let me just give you a
couple of perspectives.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.460
I'll give you this one specifically.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.190
There's times where I tell my
kids, Hey, come give me a hug.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.040
And you know what they do?

00:21:18.649 --> 00:21:19.879
Oh, okay, dad.

00:21:19.879 --> 00:21:23.449
And then they like, wrap their arms around
and it's just like this half hearted hug.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.669
And you know why they do it?

00:21:24.999 --> 00:21:25.950
Because I'm their dad.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.240
And they're gonna listen to me.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.740
Because that's what I tell them to do.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.379
But the times that my kids
choose to come give me a hug.

00:21:34.379 --> 00:21:36.279
That's the special hugs that I love.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.929
And that may be simple to you, but
I would just think of it this way.

00:21:39.949 --> 00:21:42.059
God wants us to choose him.

00:21:43.399 --> 00:21:46.570
So he gave Adam a choice, and
that's where the choice comes.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.870
And yes, with the choice comes
the opportunity to experience the

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.689
consequences of choosing wrong.

00:21:52.139 --> 00:21:53.769
And we see that later, right?

00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:57.209
So he wants people to choose
him freely and willingly.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.830
He wants people to obey rather than
just submit out of just have to, right?

00:22:03.555 --> 00:22:06.735
And, uh, when we look at this first
command that God had given Adam,

00:22:07.165 --> 00:22:08.705
it was the most important command.

00:22:09.095 --> 00:22:13.205
Again, because of choice, but because
it also would protect Adam and would

00:22:13.205 --> 00:22:15.275
allow him to experience God's best.

00:22:15.795 --> 00:22:18.695
And again, I would just say this
to ourselves, when we choose

00:22:18.715 --> 00:22:22.965
obedience, when we choose God,
we experience God's blessing.

00:22:23.805 --> 00:22:25.635
But when we don't, we miss out on it.

00:22:26.285 --> 00:22:29.135
So, we move on from there and we see...

00:22:29.679 --> 00:22:35.270
The first marriage and how God originally
designed it in verses 18 through 25 here.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.830
So verse 18 says this, Then the Lord God
said it is not good for man to be alone.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.979
This is the first time in all of creation
that God says something is not good.

00:22:46.489 --> 00:22:48.939
He says all kinds of
things have been good.

00:22:48.939 --> 00:22:49.750
It's been good.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.350
It's, it's really good.

00:22:51.469 --> 00:22:56.709
But there's one thing that's not good
and it was not good for man to be alone.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.990
And so then he says this, I will
make a helper corresponding to him.

00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:05.480
And the Lord God formed out of the
ground every wild animal and every

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.720
bird of the sky and brought each to
the man to see what he would call it.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.360
And whatever the man called a
living creature, that was his name.

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:16.889
And the man gave names to all
the livestock to the birds of

00:23:16.889 --> 00:23:18.790
the sky and to the wild animal.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.860
But for the man, no helper was
found corresponding to him.

00:23:22.719 --> 00:23:26.870
So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
come over the man and he slept and God

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:31.819
took one of his ribs and he closed the
flesh at that place and then the Lord God

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.029
made the rib he had taken from the man
into a woman and brought her to the man

00:23:36.389 --> 00:23:43.154
and the man said This is, at last, is one
of my bone, um, or, I'm saying this wrong.

00:23:43.164 --> 00:23:46.884
This one, at last, is bone of
my bone and flesh of my flesh.

00:23:46.904 --> 00:23:48.374
This one will be called woman.

00:23:48.884 --> 00:23:50.904
And she was taken from man.

00:23:51.274 --> 00:23:54.215
And this is why a man leaves his
father and mother and bonds to his

00:23:54.225 --> 00:23:56.164
wife, and they become one flesh.

00:23:56.195 --> 00:23:58.774
And both the man and his
wife were naked and fell.

00:23:58.945 --> 00:23:59.364
No.

00:24:00.465 --> 00:24:03.645
So let's kind of jump in here
and dive through this, right?

00:24:03.915 --> 00:24:06.274
It's not good for man to be alone.

00:24:06.635 --> 00:24:10.855
Um, when you think about this idea
is think about where Adam's at,

00:24:10.865 --> 00:24:13.124
what was not good for, for Adam.

00:24:13.655 --> 00:24:16.395
And, and maybe I just need to
speak for the men for a little bit.

00:24:16.925 --> 00:24:20.895
Is there like some fun in it, like to
just be home alone and watching the

00:24:20.895 --> 00:24:22.489
football game and eating what you want?

00:24:23.259 --> 00:24:23.939
I mean, come on, guys.

00:24:23.939 --> 00:24:24.519
We like that.

00:24:24.759 --> 00:24:26.529
So what's not good about Adam and God?

00:24:26.529 --> 00:24:29.779
Like, God came to me, and you just
hang out and be like, this is great.

00:24:30.739 --> 00:24:33.359
But God knew that wouldn't last very long.

00:24:33.419 --> 00:24:36.729
God would get tired of man and say,
you need to get, figure this out, okay?

00:24:37.049 --> 00:24:41.010
Um, but, so it wasn't good for Adam,
even though he had God's fellowship.

00:24:41.349 --> 00:24:46.039
He enjoyed the fruit of the garden,
the protection of the garden.

00:24:46.189 --> 00:24:48.219
What more could he need?

00:24:49.019 --> 00:24:51.709
And God knew he needed a
helper corresponding to him.

00:24:51.709 --> 00:24:53.659
And this word corresponding, this
is basically what he's saying.

00:24:53.799 --> 00:24:58.509
He needed a helper equivalent
in character, form, or function.

00:24:59.189 --> 00:25:01.709
And I want to kind of reference
this idea with helper.

00:25:01.709 --> 00:25:03.539
Don't think of this as demeaning.

00:25:04.405 --> 00:25:06.905
Christ actually called himself a helper.

00:25:07.485 --> 00:25:10.475
Uh, this is a beautiful thing, and we're
gonna break that down even more as well.

00:25:10.804 --> 00:25:13.084
Um, but when we look at
this, verse 19, right?

00:25:13.085 --> 00:25:16.435
He takes an interesting route
in creating this helper.

00:25:16.764 --> 00:25:20.665
He starts with bringing all these
animals to Adam, and he says, Name them.

00:25:21.205 --> 00:25:21.544
Right?

00:25:21.834 --> 00:25:22.854
Name these animals.

00:25:22.854 --> 00:25:26.495
And as these animals come up, you know,
obviously it's not in the English words,

00:25:26.495 --> 00:25:30.844
it's in other words, but he begins to name
them, and I begin to think about this.

00:25:31.084 --> 00:25:34.374
Adam had to eventually get
tired of naming animals, right?

00:25:34.385 --> 00:25:38.375
He has these big things, these big
names, like you know, Leviathan,

00:25:38.485 --> 00:25:40.975
or Gorilla, or Armadillo.

00:25:41.125 --> 00:25:43.705
There comes a point where he's so
tired, he's like, Cat, Dog, and

00:25:43.705 --> 00:25:47.215
Rat, like, I'm so done with naming
these things, can we move on?

00:25:48.384 --> 00:25:50.854
Maybe, I know that's in English
words, don't, don't come back

00:25:50.854 --> 00:25:52.064
and tell me, I know, okay.

00:25:52.374 --> 00:25:54.074
But I'm just thinking
that had to get tiring.

00:25:54.074 --> 00:25:55.614
But what do we think that Adam saw?

00:25:55.614 --> 00:25:59.084
Again, we're trying to make, uh, uh,
of kind of like, we're not there.

00:25:59.084 --> 00:26:00.164
So what's Adam seeing?

00:26:00.164 --> 00:26:04.494
And we see it in the next verse, but Adam
seeing these animals come and many would

00:26:04.495 --> 00:26:09.334
believe that these animals would come in
pairs and Adam would over and over again,

00:26:09.344 --> 00:26:15.524
see these animals come in pairs and be
sensing a deep disconnection in his life.

00:26:15.914 --> 00:26:16.814
They have to.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:18.199
I have none.

00:26:19.409 --> 00:26:20.370
They have two.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:21.449
I have none.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.149
I'm missing something.

00:26:23.159 --> 00:26:24.120
Where's my mate?

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:25.889
Where's my helper?

00:26:25.929 --> 00:26:29.570
Where's my other, right,
corresponding person?

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.050
And so it says this in verse 20, right?

00:26:32.239 --> 00:26:35.999
And after the man had gave all
these names, he realized that

00:26:35.999 --> 00:26:39.389
there was no one found, no helper
found corresponding to him.

00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:40.969
And so this is what God does, right?

00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:42.829
He ends up taking, mm hmm.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.260
A rib out of Adam.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.320
And this is the cool part.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.429
This is where we see the first
anesthesiologist come into creation.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.769
He puts Adam to sleep.

00:26:52.169 --> 00:26:55.329
Um, and then God took out the rib, right?

00:26:55.610 --> 00:27:00.659
And just so you know, this is how,
uh, practical I was as a new believer.

00:27:00.959 --> 00:27:03.110
Uh, and just so you, this will
just really tell you how dumb

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.300
of a pastor you probably have.

00:27:04.629 --> 00:27:05.820
So I'm studying this text.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.249
I remember the first time and I read
this and I go, Do men have one less rib?

00:27:10.735 --> 00:27:11.435
Dead serious.

00:27:11.485 --> 00:27:13.754
And I was like thinking this,
like, do men have one less rib?

00:27:13.754 --> 00:27:16.504
Like, I mean, that was Adam at, at
that point, Adam had one less rib.

00:27:16.504 --> 00:27:17.894
I'm like, are we just
all created with one?

00:27:18.194 --> 00:27:18.864
That's not true.

00:27:18.864 --> 00:27:20.084
Just say, just cover that out.

00:27:20.084 --> 00:27:20.435
Okay.

00:27:20.824 --> 00:27:23.094
But I was just that person
just trying to really ingrain

00:27:23.104 --> 00:27:24.284
in what God was doing in that.

00:27:24.284 --> 00:27:28.184
And I was pretty stupid in that, but
we all have the same amount of ribs.

00:27:28.424 --> 00:27:28.684
Okay.

00:27:29.014 --> 00:27:35.044
But God used this rib to make
a suitable companion for Adam.

00:27:35.784 --> 00:27:36.725
So a couple of things to answer here.

00:27:36.725 --> 00:27:37.245
And I want to kind of.

00:27:37.245 --> 00:27:37.384
Okay.

00:27:37.485 --> 00:27:39.055
I'm gonna speak to this specifically.

00:27:39.385 --> 00:27:43.275
God didn't make this
woman to be Adam's slave.

00:27:43.945 --> 00:27:47.234
He didn't make her to be a
lesser creation or creature.

00:27:47.655 --> 00:27:48.365
Uh, why?

00:27:48.375 --> 00:27:50.425
Because both of them
were made in His image.

00:27:50.905 --> 00:27:52.984
Both of them had dominion over creation.

00:27:52.984 --> 00:27:54.554
Both of them had the same purpose.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:28:00.360
Okay, in that idea of creation,
uh, Matthew Henry actually says it

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.929
in this way in regards to women.

00:28:01.929 --> 00:28:07.010
He says, she was not made out of his
head to rule over him, nor out of

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:11.499
his feet to be trampled upon him,
but out of his side to be equal with

00:28:11.499 --> 00:28:16.399
him under his arm to be protected
and near his heart to be beloved.

00:28:17.135 --> 00:28:19.745
So she was corresponding to him, right?

00:28:19.784 --> 00:28:21.995
Equivalent in character,
form, and function.

00:28:22.545 --> 00:28:25.354
And, and I don't have enough time
to dive into this, but later on

00:28:25.355 --> 00:28:29.155
in the Bible it explains this
idea of equal submission and role.

00:28:29.424 --> 00:28:33.995
Yes, we all have, as men and women,
different roles in this relationship.

00:28:34.124 --> 00:28:35.045
Absolutely, 100%.

00:28:36.105 --> 00:28:38.024
But it's equal submission to one another.

00:28:38.055 --> 00:28:42.820
Equality in the idea of,
preferring one another, putting one

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.820
another's needs before the other.

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.629
And there's a beautiful picture to this.

00:28:46.629 --> 00:28:49.620
But I wanted to make it as clear as
possible that Eve is not just this

00:28:49.629 --> 00:28:54.769
helper to go do whatever Adam said,
but it is to be a equal partner in

00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:56.699
this relationship that God created.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.709
Got one Amen from the woman.

00:28:59.719 --> 00:29:00.899
Okay, there we go.

00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.600
All right.

00:29:02.259 --> 00:29:08.879
So we see here in verse 23
uh, God presents this woman.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:14.070
To Adam and Adam's response and most
believe this is kind of like a little Like

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:19.330
poem or something that he specifically
was saying, uh as soon as god, uh brought

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:23.709
this woman to me He says this one is at
last bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh

00:29:23.989 --> 00:29:29.824
and this one will be called woman and
she Was taken For she was taken from man.

00:29:30.384 --> 00:29:33.844
I look at it this way, maybe
I, I'm, I typically see

00:29:33.844 --> 00:29:36.044
things very funny in, in text.

00:29:36.404 --> 00:29:40.274
And I believe that Adam saw
her and went, whoa, man.

00:29:41.044 --> 00:29:43.344
And then realized that he's
just gonna call her woman, okay?

00:29:44.495 --> 00:29:47.784
They had some of that stuff, you
know, back then as well, you know.

00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:50.804
Some of that stuff, you know, I'm
talking about the lingo, right?

00:29:50.934 --> 00:29:52.754
Whoa, man, like, she's hot.

00:29:53.524 --> 00:29:55.024
I mean, she was naked after all.

00:29:55.514 --> 00:29:57.254
I knew I was gonna go there, sorry.

00:29:58.085 --> 00:29:59.055
They didn't know it.

00:29:59.095 --> 00:29:59.905
It's okay.

00:29:59.995 --> 00:30:00.915
They didn't know it.

00:30:01.395 --> 00:30:02.305
They didn't know it.

00:30:02.815 --> 00:30:03.685
Moving on.

00:30:03.995 --> 00:30:10.455
Okay, so we see that God made man
for woman and woman for man, and I

00:30:10.455 --> 00:30:13.815
want to just slowly kind of highlight
this idea behind in today's society.

00:30:13.815 --> 00:30:16.045
Obviously, people are
missing out on that, right?

00:30:16.175 --> 00:30:18.695
They're not experiencing the
blessing between man and woman.

00:30:18.695 --> 00:30:20.815
They're not experiencing it in
marriage because sometimes they're

00:30:20.815 --> 00:30:22.405
choosing not even to get married.

00:30:22.835 --> 00:30:26.825
Which would, we're going to talk
about in verse 24, the idea behind the

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.715
oneness that comes through marriage.

00:30:28.855 --> 00:30:33.625
We also see it in choosing of the
opposite sex and not marrying a

00:30:33.625 --> 00:30:36.355
man or the man and woman, it being
man and man or woman and woman.

00:30:36.495 --> 00:30:40.905
They're missing out on that blessing that
God has originally designed in creation.

00:30:41.215 --> 00:30:44.255
And that's a hard topic to talk
about and hard things to miss.

00:30:44.315 --> 00:30:48.175
But I would say this, when we dive
into the Word, we're seeing God's best.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:53.970
On display, God's design on display
and anything separate from that.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.890
And this isn't the only thing,
but we're here on this text.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.870
Anything else than that is
missing out on God's best.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:00.940
And I would just say this.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.930
Why do we want to miss out on God's
best if he designed it this way?

00:31:05.425 --> 00:31:07.925
Okay, and so he says
this in verse 24, right?

00:31:08.145 --> 00:31:09.965
Uh, and, and we kind of
see this in verse 24.

00:31:09.965 --> 00:31:13.435
It kind of takes a shift because that was
Adam speaking, and then this is really God

00:31:13.435 --> 00:31:16.945
speaking, uh, and giving a word, what we
believe, to Moses when he's writing this.

00:31:16.945 --> 00:31:20.935
He says, this is why a man leaves
his father and his mother and

00:31:20.935 --> 00:31:24.935
the bonds with his wife, and
they become one flesh, right?

00:31:24.945 --> 00:31:25.795
One flesh.

00:31:26.475 --> 00:31:30.695
And when we think about this bond
of one flesh, think of it this way.

00:31:30.875 --> 00:31:35.185
Once they are married, you will never see
them as though they could be separate.

00:31:35.825 --> 00:31:36.095
Right?

00:31:36.235 --> 00:31:38.505
Once they're put together,
they have become one.

00:31:38.515 --> 00:31:40.075
You wouldn't even know there was two.

00:31:40.375 --> 00:31:42.365
That's the design of marriage so much.

00:31:42.765 --> 00:31:44.375
But, what do we know?

00:31:44.835 --> 00:31:49.125
Again, in our society, I would say
almost over 50 percent of relationships

00:31:49.145 --> 00:31:50.525
and marriage end in divorce.

00:31:50.535 --> 00:31:51.965
That's even in the church, y'all.

00:31:52.565 --> 00:31:56.445
What happens when you try to
separate something that was

00:31:56.455 --> 00:31:58.045
designed to be together forever?

00:31:58.165 --> 00:31:58.815
It gets messy.

00:31:59.795 --> 00:32:00.855
It's not God's design.

00:32:00.855 --> 00:32:03.195
And, and here's the thing, if
you've been divorced, it's not

00:32:03.195 --> 00:32:07.005
here to, to, to knock on you or to
make you feel like bad about it.

00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:08.645
It's, it's, you, you know it.

00:32:08.655 --> 00:32:09.515
It was messy.

00:32:09.955 --> 00:32:10.805
And it's tough.

00:32:10.835 --> 00:32:12.335
And that's not what God designed.

00:32:12.565 --> 00:32:14.585
And yes, there's redemption through that.

00:32:14.585 --> 00:32:18.405
And there's opportunity to, to
experience God again in a new way.

00:32:18.585 --> 00:32:20.865
But we see this is so important.

00:32:20.865 --> 00:32:26.985
This one flesh is, is, I would say this,
it's this term of saying, we can't ever

00:32:26.985 --> 00:32:29.685
look as though we could live life apart.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.050
And that's hard.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.660
I'm just telling you, marriage is hard.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.670
I've been long, married long
enough, and she'll tell you.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.590
I asked her the other day,
how do you put up with me?

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.510
And she says, I don't know, Jesus.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.410
That's what she says.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:42.950
No, Jesus, right?

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.650
But God designed them
to be one flesh, right?

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:49.150
Martin Luther says this, he called
marriage a school for character.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:50.710
I love this, a school for character.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:55.430
As two people live together in holy
matrimony, the experience either

00:32:55.450 --> 00:33:01.220
brings out the best in them, It's an
opportunity to exercise faith, hope,

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:07.820
and love, and to mature in sacrifice and
service to one another for God's glory.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:12.940
So I would say this, God designed
marriage in the beginning to

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.040
display His glory to the world.

00:33:16.695 --> 00:33:20.895
His perfect, because they became one,
they became something that was perfect,

00:33:21.455 --> 00:33:25.745
in this perfect garden, in this, in
this beautiful place, and all these

00:33:25.765 --> 00:33:26.985
amazing things that God has created.

00:33:26.995 --> 00:33:30.885
These are all the first, the first
man, and the first home, the first

00:33:30.905 --> 00:33:35.715
covenant that was to protect Adam in
future generations, and it was the first

00:33:35.785 --> 00:33:41.295
marriage, and design of marriage, and
God created all of that for us, right?

00:33:41.785 --> 00:33:42.805
All of that for us.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.640
So we see in verse 25, just to
kind of highlight it right, he

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.590
says this, Both man and his wife
were naked, yet they felt no shame.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.390
Again, that's going to really
speak to later when we realize

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:54.790
that they realized their nakedness.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:58.730
But this is really, is we, we, we
find out that they felt no shame.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.870
It was natural.

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:03.550
It was, it was not, for
them, it wasn't indecent.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.510
It was beautiful.

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:08.500
It was beautiful, the
way that God had created.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.870
There was no need to cover God's beauty in
this garden until sin came into the world.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.430
And again, that was God's
original design with him.

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:19.380
So the question is, how do
we leave out of here today?

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.650
This is a lot that we covered.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:23.260
We dove into some of it a little bit
deeper, but how do we leave out of

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.220
here with some practical application?

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.460
What do we take home?

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.540
I would say this in seeing
God's original design.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:33.360
This is my hope for you in seeing God's
original design and plan being put into

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.960
place that we desire to be a part of that.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.970
Now, what we do know.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.830
Is that because sin is in the world,
we don't get to experience this beauty

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.840
that God originally created right now.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:48.870
Now we can experience what I would call
a taste of it in living in the ways

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.200
in which God has called us to live.

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:54.015
But ultimately, we won't fully
experience it until we spend

00:34:54.015 --> 00:34:55.605
eternity in heaven with God again.

00:34:56.035 --> 00:35:01.355
But we can experience some of that this
side of heaven by obeying the Lord, by

00:35:01.445 --> 00:35:06.005
seeing that God's perspective is not
limited, by trusting that His design

00:35:06.005 --> 00:35:08.095
is better than my fleshly desires.

00:35:08.475 --> 00:35:13.055
That's hard, choosing
God over me at times.

00:35:13.245 --> 00:35:16.675
And that's why His Word reminds
us that He knows what's best.

00:35:17.315 --> 00:35:21.395
So we see this, right, this blessing
that was given to Adam and Eve.

00:35:21.815 --> 00:35:26.485
And before sin came into the world and my
challenge to you today as we walk through

00:35:26.485 --> 00:35:32.475
invitation is for you to ask God to help
you experience some of that blessing

00:35:32.715 --> 00:35:34.855
today, some of that blessing in your life.

00:35:34.885 --> 00:35:35.945
Maybe it's your marriage.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:42.830
Maybe it's just you appreciating you,
meaning this, your creation, that God

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:47.940
knitted you together in your mother's womb
and he breathed breath into your life.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:55.070
You think that Adam was the only one that
God breathed breath into his, their life?

00:35:55.070 --> 00:36:02.700
No, like every single person that is
born in this world, God breathed breath

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.900
into their lungs so that they could live.

00:36:05.665 --> 00:36:06.175
You.

00:36:07.205 --> 00:36:10.905
So we're gonna take time to, to even think
about that and maybe be consumed by that.

00:36:10.905 --> 00:36:14.735
And then the other challenge I'm gonna
challenge you to do is to take time

00:36:14.735 --> 00:36:17.075
to just look at your heart in life.

00:36:18.255 --> 00:36:19.595
Is, we may have sin in our life.

00:36:19.595 --> 00:36:22.205
We may have times where we
have disobeyed the Lord.

00:36:22.225 --> 00:36:25.085
We have not been following the Lord the
way that God has called us to and we'll

00:36:25.085 --> 00:36:26.975
be able to pray and repent and do that.

00:36:26.975 --> 00:36:29.115
So I'll lead you through that in just
a minute, but I'm gonna pray for us.

00:36:29.485 --> 00:36:32.145
So Lord Jesus, we thank
you so much for your word.

00:36:32.405 --> 00:36:33.625
We thank you for your truth.

00:36:33.655 --> 00:36:37.715
We thank you for how you continue
to remind us of our original.

00:36:37.915 --> 00:36:44.195
design, uh, Lord, one that, Lord, was
meant to be perfect and this perfect

00:36:44.195 --> 00:36:47.965
garden where you provided for us
and you provided another helper and,

00:36:48.275 --> 00:36:51.455
and where we would have just been
fruitful and we would have multiplied.

00:36:51.455 --> 00:36:57.165
But Lord, you gave us this one thing, this
choice, that every single person that was

00:36:57.205 --> 00:37:00.575
ever created has the ability to choose.

00:37:01.005 --> 00:37:04.775
And it's beautiful, but it also
comes with some consequences, Lord.

00:37:04.775 --> 00:37:09.070
And we, See that today, Lord, that we
sometimes choose You, and we experience

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:13.710
the blessing, and we sometimes choose
ourselves and our flesh, and the things

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:16.750
that are not godly and the things
that are not beneficial for us, and

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.330
we experience less than Your best.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.520
So, Lord, I pray that as we walk through
this invitation, Lord, that each person

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:30.030
truly opens their heart, and they pour
their requests out to You, and they begin

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.530
to ask for You to transform their lives.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.680
So, Lord, we just pray
this in Your heavenly name.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:35.830
Amen.

00:37:36.465 --> 00:37:38.505
So, I want to lead you through invitation.

00:37:38.505 --> 00:37:41.795
I love being able to do this, so this
just allows you to take time to sit

00:37:41.795 --> 00:37:45.305
where you are with your eyes closed and
say, Lord, speak to me in this moment.

00:37:45.305 --> 00:37:50.075
So, the first thing that I just want
to encourage you to pray is maybe

00:37:50.075 --> 00:37:54.125
you ask God this question, Have you
forgotten your purpose for creation?

00:37:54.515 --> 00:37:59.925
That God created you with His breath to
work and display His image to the world.

00:38:00.225 --> 00:38:04.065
So, ask God this question, Lord, am
I representing you to the world the

00:38:04.065 --> 00:38:08.105
way you've designed me, or am I not?

00:38:08.755 --> 00:38:12.165
And based upon how the Lord responds
to you, I want you to pray and ask God

00:38:12.165 --> 00:38:15.705
to forgive you or to help you continue
to be that image bearer to the world.

00:38:15.705 --> 00:38:17.675
So just spend some time
praying for that specifically.

00:38:57.155 --> 00:38:59.795
Alright, the next thing I want to
challenge you to do is this is something

00:38:59.795 --> 00:39:01.145
I challenge you to do every day.

00:39:02.325 --> 00:39:05.375
But today specifically, I want you
to just ask the Lord this question.

00:39:05.375 --> 00:39:09.065
Lord, is there anything in my
life that is not honoring to you?

00:39:09.655 --> 00:39:13.055
Is there sin in my life
that I need to repent of?

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.280
And the reason why I challenge
you to do that, because if we

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:22.020
have sin in our lives that we are
unrepentant about, we will miss that

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.190
relationship that God has for us.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:25.840
It will hinder our relationship
that we have with the Lord.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.900
So I don't know what that could
be, but you do, the Lord does.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.100
So just sit there and ask the
Lord, Is there a sin in my

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.230
life that I need to repent of?

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:38.980
And if there is, ask God to forgive you,
and to wash it away, and to give you a new

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.530
perspective on life, a new relationship.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.050
So just spend some time
praying and asking.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:44.950
And

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:32.050
the last thing that I want to share, and
I always want to share this, is if you

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.940
are sitting in this room and you've never
experienced a relationship with Jesus,

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:39.620
you've never experienced a true saving
relationship with Jesus, that you can

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:45.230
ask God to come into your life, repent
of your sins, and experience a blessing,

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:50.870
one that will transform your life,
transform many people in this room's life.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.280
And so how do you do that?

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.930
By confessing your need for Jesus.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:59.140
By asking for forgiveness of your sins,
and by committing your life to Him,

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.760
to follow Him the rest of your life.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.560
And I just encourage you, right where
you are, to say that to the Lord,

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:09.700
and ask Him to move in your life, and
transform your life, and to use you.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.220
Because all it takes is faith.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.370
Faith in God.

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:15.860
Turning over to Him.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:17.930
Don't complicate it.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.360
Just receive His grace and mercy,
so He can transform your life.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.410
And if you believe that and if you
pray that, I challenge you, I challenge

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.710
you today to come and talk to me.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:33.520
Come talk to someone and say, I've given
my life to Jesus, I'm repenting of my

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.440
sins, I need some help to walk in this.

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:38.960
Maybe you need help to walk in your faith.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.450
We all do, honestly.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.910
So my challenge to you is don't leave
that to just between you and God.

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:48.540
Make sure you profess it and you talk
to someone and you share that with them.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.370
I'm gonna pray for us, and then
here in just a minute, we're gonna

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:53.980
stand, and I want us to worship.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:42:00.160
I want us to worship like God is our
creator, not, this is the last song before

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:02.930
Ben gives announcements and we get to go
eat some lunch and watch the Bengals game.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:03.970
You know what I mean?

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.900
Okay, nobody does know what I mean.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:10.360
I want you to worship like there's no one
else in the room other than you and God.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.040
Because your creator loves you.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.160
And he deserves worship.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:16.640
Not because...

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:18.610
That's what makes you right with God.

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:22.880
But because that's what
makes you who you are.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:24.850
He made you who you are.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:25.650
So let's pray.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:27.940
Lord Jesus, we know you are God.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.520
We have studied about it.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:30.560
We have seen creation.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.840
And Lord, I don't know how after the last
three weeks, we can't walk out of here

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.920
in awe of, Lord, what you've created.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:44.905
Lord, you have given Us, this life,
every one of us that is sitting here

00:42:45.155 --> 00:42:49.935
are breathing in and breathing out
because you breathe life into us first.

00:42:50.865 --> 00:42:54.315
And God, too many times, maybe I'm
just speaking about myself, Lord, too

00:42:54.315 --> 00:42:59.305
many times I take every bit of creation
and everything I have in my family

00:42:59.475 --> 00:43:03.025
and everything I have in my life for
granted because Lord, it's not enough.

00:43:03.025 --> 00:43:03.635
That's what I feel like.

00:43:03.635 --> 00:43:04.435
It's not enough.

00:43:04.895 --> 00:43:06.935
Maybe there's people in this
room that feel the same way I do.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.800
But Lord, it is enough because you
have not taken that breath from me.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.770
You've not taken that
breath from anybody else.

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:18.830
You've given it to them to
breathe and to live and to

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:21.420
represent you, Lord, to the world.

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:28.020
To be a reflection of your character
and your spirit and your love

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.700
and your mercy and your grace.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.560
So Lord, I just pray that you meet
every person right where they are.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:35.760
You give them.

00:43:36.635 --> 00:43:39.415
Or just a renewed spirit
in their life, Lord.

00:43:39.815 --> 00:43:43.635
To truly worship you and to live for you,
Lord, like they've never lived before.

00:43:44.145 --> 00:43:47.955
But God, I'm praying if there's someone
in this room that doesn't know you or

00:43:47.955 --> 00:43:52.275
that's afraid to profess you or they
don't know at all and they have questions,

00:43:52.295 --> 00:43:55.505
Lord, that they'll come and they'll talk
to me, Lord, they'll talk to someone and

00:43:55.505 --> 00:43:57.075
they'll just say, hey, I have questions.

00:43:57.525 --> 00:44:01.235
Because God, there's nothing like
a personal relationship with you.

00:44:01.485 --> 00:44:04.625
And I desire to see every
person in this room know you.

00:44:06.245 --> 00:44:10.115
So, Lord, move like you have always
moved, but move even more, Lord.

00:44:10.115 --> 00:44:13.315
We're asking for your Spirit to move
in our lives and in this church.

00:44:14.615 --> 00:44:16.035
So, Lord, we just pray
this in your heavenly name.

00:44:16.755 --> 00:44:17.185
Amen.

00:44:17.435 --> 00:44:19.425
Let's stand and let's worship.
