00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.660
Just to kind of catch you guys up on this
is, uh, last time we, we took communion

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.940
was, uh, I think it could have been the
first Sunday that we gathered as a team.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.550
So some of you may remember this,
if you were on our core team, the,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.490
the facility in here was unfinished.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.380
It was dirty in here.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.760
And we sat up like right over here.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.940
With some random chairs and
hung out and took communion.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.840
And to me, that was one of
the most special times to take

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.930
communion because, you know,
community, it's a time to remember.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.160
And in the time of taking communion, I
remembered all that God had done through

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.750
our church to get it to that point.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.110
And, uh, I was in that again today
and doing that again this week of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.710
like, what has God done to bring
us to this point as a church?

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.640
And it's just so amazing to see.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.150
What he's brought us to and what
he's doing in and through us

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.650
because of what he did on the cross.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.790
And so it's really cool.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.960
Um, but we spent some time talking about,
uh, remembering Jesus's example, um, and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.460
we kind of hit some highlights of that.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.150
Whenever we discuss that as a team,
back in March, I think it was March.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.110
Um, but I thought it would be
good for us to go a little bit.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.010
And talk about that same thing
and the reason why is it?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.100
I think it's a, it's a text
this rarely talked about or

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.470
preached about during communion.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.620
Typically you're going to go to, you
know, the, them sitting around the

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.870
table and all the details of that.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.789
Or you may even go to Paul and talking
about, um, what he had talked about,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.590
um, with the Corinthians and communion.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.710
Um, and so today we're going to
be in John chapter 13 and we're

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.670
going to start in verse one.

00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:38.325
And so I want to ask this question,
because again, I love asking questions

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:43.455
when we first start off, uh, here is,
um, have you ever told someone something

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:47.895
and in this moment that they walked
away, they forgot what you said, anybody.

00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:50.075
Okay.

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:55.115
Wives may be looking at their husbands or
parents may be thinking about their kids.

00:01:55.235 --> 00:01:57.095
And my son chaining is probably the worst.

00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:59.884
I'll be like a lot of times, if
I'm going to tell them something

00:01:59.884 --> 00:02:02.495
of importance I've got to get,
Hey son, look at me in the ice.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.460
Go get your coat out of your room.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.750
Okay.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.620
Okay, dad, next thing you know,
I'm like chaining, where are you?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.850
I'm in the living room.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.900
Do you get your coat?

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.190
Oh, I forgot.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.370
And it's that moment
where we're like, right.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.420
Well, communion, communion is a time
to remember, um, any in, in Jesus

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.610
talks about, you know, as we do this.

00:02:27.674 --> 00:02:28.635
We should remember.

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:32.385
And a lot of times it's just God saying
this remembering is such an important

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:38.385
part of our life, because if we remember
why we do something, why God did

00:02:38.385 --> 00:02:41.114
something for us, it will motivate us.

00:02:41.114 --> 00:02:43.695
It will give us some kind of a grounded.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.019
In how we live at our lives.

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.700
But if we forget to remember which, Hey,
come next week, we get to talk about

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.769
what happens when we forget to remember.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.390
Um, but when we forget to remember
our lives tend to veer off.

00:02:58.364 --> 00:03:00.015
From what God had called us to do.

00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:01.725
And so remembering is so powerful.

00:03:01.725 --> 00:03:01.965
Right?

00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:06.584
And so in today's text, we're gonna see,
not that, that Jesus didn't just tell

00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:08.714
his followers something, he modeled it.

00:03:08.714 --> 00:03:12.255
And so, Jesus, isn't just going to tell
us something today, he's going to model

00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:13.935
it and then challenge us to model it.

00:03:13.935 --> 00:03:14.234
Right.

00:03:14.234 --> 00:03:17.355
So just to kind of set this
up in this text, see Jesus

00:03:17.355 --> 00:03:18.584
was heading towards the cross.

00:03:18.584 --> 00:03:18.975
Right.

00:03:19.214 --> 00:03:21.345
We know that Jesus lived a sinless life.

00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:23.385
Perfect example.

00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:24.674
He had healed people.

00:03:25.065 --> 00:03:25.655
I top.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.680
Um, and he had came to this
point in his life where he

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.300
knew he was going to the cross.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.540
It was that moment where he's like,
okay, my time here is almost done.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.870
Um, and so we see this time
of what they call the last.

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:41.205
Um, and just to kind of give you
this little bit of background here,

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:45.375
the last supper was them getting
ready to celebrate the Passover.

00:03:45.465 --> 00:03:48.255
And so does anybody know
what the Passover was?

00:03:48.285 --> 00:03:49.545
You've been studying about it at all.

00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:49.725
Okay.

00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:50.385
The Passover.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:53.475
So just to kind of catch everybody up
to make sure we're on the same page, the

00:03:53.475 --> 00:03:56.175
Passover happened back in Exodus, right?

00:03:56.175 --> 00:03:59.115
So Moses led the people
of Israel out of Egypt.

00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:03.015
And before they left Egypt to
finally be able to even be,

00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:05.955
let, go from Pharaoh, God.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.140
Had something called the Passover happen.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.149
What they had to do is they had to
kill a lamb, or I think it was even

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:14.339
possibly a goat of certain year.

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:16.680
No blemish that to kill it.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.130
And they had to smear
blood over their doorposts.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.360
So that.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.610
When the spirit of the Lord would come
into Egypt, that he would pass over

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.120
the homes that had the mark of this
perfect lamb, but the homes he didn't

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.380
pass over, they didn't have that mark.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.520
He would kill their firstborn, which that
sounds so brutal guys sounds so brutal.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.830
Um, there's more context.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.770
I don't have enough time to teach
why God did that, but I do know this

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.430
after that happened, which means God
passed over every one of the Israelites

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.530
homes that had that marking on there.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.700
They didn't kill their firstborn.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.340
Um, God had set a precedent.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.170
He said, Remember this every year, you'll
have a Passover feast to remember what

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.250
I did for you to get you out of slavery
and to send you to the promised land.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.190
So every year they celebrated that
every year they celebrated that.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.000
And so what Jesus said, he says,
and now I'm creating a new covenant.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.600
So the last supper was this last time
that they would celebrate the Passover

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.190
and there would be a new covenant.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.730
The new covenant was Jesus
has split the perfect sacker.

00:05:19.155 --> 00:05:23.355
Being now put his blood over
our doorposts, our lives, right.

00:05:23.775 --> 00:05:27.705
And anybody that accepts Jesus
as Lord over their life accepts

00:05:27.705 --> 00:05:29.895
Jesus payment of his sacrifice.

00:05:30.165 --> 00:05:33.825
We have now that marker so that at
the end of our life, whenever God

00:05:33.825 --> 00:05:38.325
comes to judge us, you'll see that
mark, you'll see what Jesus did on

00:05:38.325 --> 00:05:41.685
the cross because you accepted that
and he'll pass over you in judgment.

00:05:42.435 --> 00:05:44.445
It's really cool how this
picture comes together.

00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:45.495
Why we celebrate.

00:05:46.395 --> 00:05:48.885
It's because we're really
celebrating the Passover and we're

00:05:48.885 --> 00:05:52.125
taking time to remember, to not to
forget all that God has done for

00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:54.735
us so that we know the sacrifice.

00:05:54.735 --> 00:05:59.025
It took to get us to the place of
knowing God to be saved from our sins,

00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:02.145
to not spend an eternity separated
from God, to not be in punishment

00:06:02.145 --> 00:06:07.275
for our sins, man, once we grasp
that, it changes the way we live.

00:06:07.695 --> 00:06:08.135
I don't want you guys.

00:06:08.155 --> 00:06:09.195
It changes the way we live.

00:06:09.195 --> 00:06:12.165
That's why God says to remember
this as you do this now, do we

00:06:12.165 --> 00:06:13.515
only have to take communion?

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:20.094
No really, if you think about acts two
is as they gathered together and as

00:06:20.094 --> 00:06:24.594
they ate together, they remembered,
they remembered what Christ had done

00:06:24.594 --> 00:06:25.675
for them and they gave him praise.

00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:26.935
And so we can do that every day.

00:06:27.325 --> 00:06:30.025
Um, sometimes maybe you do that
every day, but we take time to set

00:06:30.025 --> 00:06:33.925
out to do that as a church to make
sure that we remember as a group,

00:06:33.925 --> 00:06:36.445
as a body together, what Christ did.

00:06:36.775 --> 00:06:38.155
So it's not about the elements.

00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:39.955
It's not about the juice.

00:06:40.105 --> 00:06:41.995
Those are things that we're symbol.

00:06:44.115 --> 00:06:47.175
But they are ways for us to just
take a tangible thing, to remember

00:06:47.175 --> 00:06:50.715
just like baptism, baptism, doesn't
save us, but it's a tangible

00:06:50.715 --> 00:06:51.945
picture of what Christ did.

00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:54.765
Why does Christ ask us to be
baptized or to celebrate communion?

00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:59.805
Because it allows us to proclaim his
coming and to proclaim his death and

00:06:59.805 --> 00:07:01.425
resurrection over and over again.

00:07:01.845 --> 00:07:02.385
So it's so.

00:07:03.705 --> 00:07:04.995
So we're coming out of right.

00:07:04.995 --> 00:07:08.775
This, the, the last supper there they're
coming around to celebrate the Passover.

00:07:09.294 --> 00:07:12.525
And the story that John describes
does not give the details that we

00:07:12.525 --> 00:07:13.965
just read off during communion.

00:07:13.995 --> 00:07:17.115
He doesn't talk about passing around the
bread and passing around the cup, but

00:07:17.115 --> 00:07:21.615
he does teach us something that I think
is his one of his last lessons that he

00:07:21.615 --> 00:07:27.224
wants each one of us to grasp about the
purpose of him dying on the cross for us.

00:07:28.284 --> 00:07:32.784
Not just talking about let's jump into the
text so that all of us can kind of, um,

00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:37.164
catch up and see what, what, what Jesus is
trying to teach us and what he was trying

00:07:37.164 --> 00:07:39.025
to teach the disciples on the last night.

00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:43.615
Um, there, so again, John
chapter 13 verses one through

00:07:43.615 --> 00:07:44.844
17, I'm going to read those.

00:07:44.844 --> 00:07:48.385
It says this assist before the
Passover festival, Jesus knew

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:51.534
that his hour had come to depart
from this world to the father.

00:07:52.284 --> 00:07:54.625
Having loved his own,
who were in the world.

00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:55.795
He loved them to the.

00:07:56.925 --> 00:08:00.525
Now, when it was time for the supper,
the devil had already put into his heart.

00:08:01.425 --> 00:08:04.545
Of Judas, Simon, Iscariot
son to betray him.

00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:07.995
And Jesus knew that the father had
given everything into his hands

00:08:08.235 --> 00:08:11.175
and then he had come from God and
that he was going back to God.

00:08:11.685 --> 00:08:15.135
And so he got up from his supper,
laid aside his outer clothing.

00:08:15.135 --> 00:08:19.395
He took a towel and he tied it around
himself and next he poured the water into

00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:23.955
the basin and began to wash his disciples
speed and dry them with a towel title.

00:08:24.914 --> 00:08:28.484
And he came to Simon, Peter who asked
him, Lord, are you going to wash my feet?

00:08:28.905 --> 00:08:29.924
And Jesus answered him.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.034
What I'm doing.

00:08:31.034 --> 00:08:34.485
You don't realize now, but
afterwards you will understand.

00:08:35.054 --> 00:08:37.275
And he says, you will never wash my feet.

00:08:37.334 --> 00:08:40.155
Peter said, so he was
rejecting God's plan.

00:08:40.245 --> 00:08:40.544
Right?

00:08:40.995 --> 00:08:46.334
So Jesus replied, if you don't wash, if I
don't wash you, you have no part with me.

00:08:46.935 --> 00:08:51.975
Simon, Peter said to him, Lord, not only
my feet, but also my hands and my head.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.060
One who has bathed.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.730
Jesus told him doesn't need to
wash anything except his feet,

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.690
but he is completely clean and
you are clean, but not all of you

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.310
for he knew who would betray him.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.590
And this is what he said,
not all of your clean.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.680
And so when he had Jesus had washed
their feet and put on his outer clothing,

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.170
he reclined again and said to them,
do you know what I've done for you?

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.420
You call me teacher and Lord.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.080
And you are speaking
Riley since that's what.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.980
So if I, your Lord and teacher have
washed your feet, you also ought

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.540
to wash one another's feet for I've
given you an example that you also

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.100
should do as I have done for you.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.060
Truly.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.660
I tell you a servant is not greater
than his master and a messenger, not

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.220
greater than the one who sent him.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.830
If you know these things, you are blessed.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.780
If you do.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:40.940
It's a lot of texts.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.010
We're going to call and walk through
this quickly, but you're going

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.090
to see some key themes in here.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.630
Number one, as Jesus spent his
last night with his disciples,

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.640
here's one thing that is clear.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.560
He was confident in his calling.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.840
He was confident in his calling.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.300
Why is it important to be confident?

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.200
Somebody tell me this?

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.990
Why is it important for a pilot to be
competent and being able to fly a plane?

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:03.500
Anybody?

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.939
So he doesn't crash question.

00:10:08.939 --> 00:10:10.530
Do you want your pilot to be confident?

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.060
Great.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.510
Okay.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.199
Why is it important for
the drivers on the road?

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:19.670
I know not all Mar to be confident
in how to drive somebody.

00:10:21.145 --> 00:10:23.425
So you don't crash, especially into you.

00:10:23.695 --> 00:10:24.895
Confidence is important.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:28.375
See, I think Jesus was painting a
picture and I'm going to give you the

00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:32.995
scripture here that points this out
confidence in your calling is important

00:10:33.115 --> 00:10:34.795
and remembering what Christ did for us.

00:10:34.855 --> 00:10:37.465
So let's look, what do you mean
by competence in his calling?

00:10:37.675 --> 00:10:39.475
Look at verse three and we're
gonna kind of break this down.

00:10:39.475 --> 00:10:43.255
It says Jesus knew that the father
had given everything into his

00:10:43.255 --> 00:10:46.165
hands and that he had come from
God and that he was going back to.

00:10:47.005 --> 00:10:47.905
So that was Jesus.

00:10:48.055 --> 00:10:51.955
He was confident and what God
had given him confident in what

00:10:51.955 --> 00:10:53.215
God to get him giving them.

00:10:53.215 --> 00:10:53.455
Right.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:58.465
And so confidence allows us to run
with endurance, the race that God has

00:10:58.465 --> 00:11:02.935
laid out for us, again, not because
of our power, but because of his.

00:11:03.655 --> 00:11:04.905
And so how did he have that confidence?

00:11:04.925 --> 00:11:06.265
We're going to walk through this one.

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:08.935
He knew God had given
everything into his hands.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.160
Here's what I look at whenever I see this.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.390
If you've read the previous part of
John John one, the chapters one through

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.890
12, here's what you see about Jesus.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.430
Number one, Jesus experienced
God in a personal way.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.300
See, Jesus spent time with God
personally, Jesus experienced

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.740
God's miracles through him.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.460
So because of his experiential
faith and his time and relationship

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.480
with God, he had come to this point
because God has done all this for me.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.990
And through me, I have confidence
in going to the cross, even though

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.610
I knew it's going to be painful and.

00:11:39.569 --> 00:11:42.060
So he had confidence
because of his relationship.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.569
Number two, he knew that
he had come from God.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:45.900
Right?

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.810
So if you know that you've come
from God, if you have a confidence

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.880
that God has used your savior.

00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:54.705
If you have confidence that you have
come from God, you know, you have

00:11:54.705 --> 00:11:59.205
come with not only God's call, but
also God's power and ability and

00:11:59.205 --> 00:12:01.185
resources to fulfill the call on you.

00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:04.545
So Jesus not only was confident
that God had given him everything

00:12:04.545 --> 00:12:07.635
into his hands, but he was
confident that he had came from God.

00:12:07.635 --> 00:12:08.865
And here's the one part that I love.

00:12:08.865 --> 00:12:10.445
He was confident that
he was going back to.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:17.910
Because if you know where your destination
will end in the arms of Jesus in a perfect

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:22.290
relationship where there is no tears,
there's no pain, there's no suffering.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.120
There's only perfection in heaven.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.890
If you have confidence where you're
going, it's easier to do what you're

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.280
doing and to live the way you live and
the live the way that God's called you to.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.040
So Jesus had confidence in his calling.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.620
So I want to now flip this to us, right?

00:12:38.835 --> 00:12:42.074
I want to flip this us and think about
how do we have confidence in our calling,

00:12:43.155 --> 00:12:44.775
where God is leading you in your life.

00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:46.725
How do you have confidence
in this number one?

00:12:47.025 --> 00:12:48.314
We know that Christ lives in us.

00:12:48.314 --> 00:12:52.605
If you've given your life to Jesus, if
you have said, Hey Lord, I understand

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:56.835
that my life apart from you sends me
to an eternity, separated from you,

00:12:56.835 --> 00:13:01.245
that I have to pay for my own sins and
that I have to live a life separate

00:13:01.245 --> 00:13:03.585
from your grace, mercy, and love.

00:13:03.795 --> 00:13:05.955
If I know that I've
given my life to Jesus.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.880
And Christ now lives inside of me.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:09.990
Here's what we know.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:14.010
If Christ had confidence that
God had given him everything.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:14.939
What does that mean?

00:13:14.939 --> 00:13:16.290
When you have Christ living inside of you?

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:21.770
Somebody tell me you should have
confidence that God has given everything

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.319
into your hands to fulfill your call.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.630
If that doesn't sink in.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:32.880
I don't know what will, if you
have Christ in you to fulfill

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.040
the call, that his place.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:39.720
You had everything, not some,
not occasional, but everything in

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.160
your hands to fulfill your call.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.450
Number two, we know that we have
come from God, just like Jesus.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.930
If you are a child of God, if you have
given your life to Jesus and you are

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:53.040
a child of God, you have a confidence
that God has given you every resource

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.560
necessary to fulfill your call.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.600
And so, you know, this is Jesus
has example of going to a cross

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.820
where he would suffer and die.

00:14:04.395 --> 00:14:05.594
Jesus had confidence.

00:14:06.015 --> 00:14:10.485
So you may be wondering, but my call is,
is difficult where I'm heading is hard.

00:14:11.444 --> 00:14:13.814
Jesus understands, but
he still had confidence.

00:14:14.115 --> 00:14:16.334
And because he lives in you, you
can have confidence, but here's

00:14:16.334 --> 00:14:17.625
the one that I love the most.

00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:20.385
We know we're going back to
God, no matter what happens.

00:14:20.385 --> 00:14:24.615
This side of heaven, we know
that we are going back to God.

00:14:24.645 --> 00:14:26.145
That should give us confidence.

00:14:26.145 --> 00:14:31.694
When we know in the end we win, we
get eternity with God and heaven.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.670
So the only thing we have left
to do is to go and fulfill our

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.170
call on the way to eternity.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:39.850
It's the same thing that Jesus did.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.030
So Jesus had confidence that
everything that God had done through

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.810
him and in him that going to the
cross, he had everything he needed.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.090
So what did he do?

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.350
What did he do?

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.640
So Jesus had confidence in his calling
and he decided to serve those around him.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:55.450
Right.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.750
He could have easily just, just so you
guys know confidence in your calling,

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.310
you know, where you're spending eternity.

00:15:01.035 --> 00:15:02.385
You can just sit there, right?

00:15:02.415 --> 00:15:05.685
I mean, Jesus could have, he could have
just waited for them to arrest him, hang

00:15:05.685 --> 00:15:08.865
them on a cross, suffer, die, raise again.

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:10.455
And now everybody can be saved.

00:15:10.485 --> 00:15:13.574
He could have just sat there, but he
said, no, I've got a little time left.

00:15:14.115 --> 00:15:15.405
I'm going to use it wisely.

00:15:15.765 --> 00:15:18.015
So I started thinking about me, man.

00:15:18.015 --> 00:15:21.135
If I got confidence that I'm
going to win in the end, I'm

00:15:21.135 --> 00:15:22.064
probably just going to hang out.

00:15:22.915 --> 00:15:23.865
I'm going to take it easy.

00:15:23.915 --> 00:15:24.915
I'm gonna take the low road.

00:15:25.635 --> 00:15:29.025
I'm probably going to just go
hang out and chill, but not Jesus.

00:15:29.835 --> 00:15:33.465
So Jesus decides to
serve those around him.

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.565
He didn't just sit there.

00:15:37.565 --> 00:15:37.835
Right?

00:15:38.195 --> 00:15:40.055
And so it began to wash
the disciples feet.

00:15:40.085 --> 00:15:44.105
We see this in verse four, he says so
after he had confidence in his calling,

00:15:44.105 --> 00:15:48.035
right, he got up from the supper and laid
aside his clothes and he took a talent.

00:15:48.035 --> 00:15:51.185
He tied it around him and he began
to pour water into a basin to begin

00:15:51.185 --> 00:15:55.115
to wash the disciples feet and dry
them with a towel tied around him.

00:15:56.075 --> 00:15:57.935
Number one, that's nasty.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.110
You know, I, I just don't know about
you guys, but feeder, probably one

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.089
of the nastiest things to us now.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.110
And we wear shoes.

00:16:06.589 --> 00:16:11.750
Imagine them when we know out on the
roads that they were, you know, riding

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.870
horses and some things were on the road
and they were probably stepping in things.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.520
I mean, you, you guys
get the picture, right?

00:16:17.719 --> 00:16:20.360
I don't even want to wash your
feet and you're wearing shoes and

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.490
Jesus was willing to step down.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.170
So w I want to give you this picture.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.350
Because remember I was teaching Jonah
and the king stepped down from his

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.070
throne and he took off his Royal
robes and he began to put on sackcloth

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.890
and ashes because of his brokenness.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.950
Jesus got down from his
throne, took off his robes.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:38.730
Really?

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.510
He did that when he came down from heaven,
number one, but he didn't even step lower.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.030
He served those around him.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.130
He was heading to the cross y'all
and he said, I'm going to surf.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.600
Wow.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:52.410
I'm going to.

00:16:53.324 --> 00:16:55.905
Of all the things he could
have done at the last supper,

00:16:56.295 --> 00:16:57.645
he decided to wash their feet.

00:16:58.094 --> 00:16:59.234
I want to ask you guys this question.

00:16:59.505 --> 00:17:02.864
Why, why do you think of all
the things Jesus could have

00:17:02.864 --> 00:17:04.815
done on his way to the cross?

00:17:05.054 --> 00:17:07.125
Why do you think he
washed the disciples feet?

00:17:14.815 --> 00:17:15.115
Yeah.

00:17:15.204 --> 00:17:19.284
To show him as an example, if you've got
a limited amount of time with someone

00:17:21.034 --> 00:17:21.935
you're going to make it worthwhile.

00:17:22.905 --> 00:17:24.675
I don't know if you've ever
been in a meeting where it's

00:17:24.675 --> 00:17:25.694
like, Hey, we got an hour.

00:17:25.995 --> 00:17:27.645
I think me and Brock sat down last Monday.

00:17:27.645 --> 00:17:29.925
And I think I told him, I
said, Hey, I got an hour.

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:32.985
We made the hour with while
I think we covered a lot.

00:17:33.495 --> 00:17:35.535
So he's like, we want
to make this valuable.

00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:37.935
So Jesus said, okay, I'm
confident where I'm going.

00:17:38.535 --> 00:17:39.885
I have everything into my hands.

00:17:40.425 --> 00:17:41.475
I've got this little bit of time.

00:17:42.075 --> 00:17:43.935
What is one last.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.030
Thing.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.320
I want to teach my disciples.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:51.690
So this is why this to me, this text is
so important guys, because communion is to

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.730
remember what God did for us on the cross.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.660
But I think convenience more, I
think is to remember the example

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.760
that Jesus set for every one of us.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.220
And if this is one of his object
lessons on the way to the.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.060
I'm probably going to lean in even more
to this one than most of the other ones.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.480
And all of them are important
even before all of John 12,

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.010
one through 12 is important.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.530
This one I'm just going to lean
in a little bit more because I'm

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:16.410
going to say, Hey, this one was
important for him to leave right here.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.379
And this part to leave
right here in this part.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.830
So I started thinking about this.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.000
Let's look at verse eight here.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.900
Verse eight says this is as it's
actually verse seven, verse eight.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.420
So Jesus is getting ready to wash Peter.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.410
Um, and Peter's like, no, I
don't want you to wash my feet.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:34.830
Right.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:35.910
Number, verse eight.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.350
He says, you will never wash my feet.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:43.590
And Jesus replied, if you will not,
let me wash your feet, then you'll

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.590
have no part in me or part of me.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.290
And so I started thinking about this.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.590
Peter tries rejects God's plan, right?

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.660
When we, when we think about
Peter in this, and I, I wanted to

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.770
take a moment to talk about this.

00:18:57.495 --> 00:19:02.835
Peter was not wanting to accept
God's plan of one, him serving him.

00:19:03.195 --> 00:19:04.635
He was rejecting God's plan.

00:19:05.595 --> 00:19:09.105
I don't know if you've ever had
that in your life where, you know,

00:19:09.465 --> 00:19:13.545
the Lord is doing something for
you or to you or through you.

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:15.735
And you begin to say, no,
I don't want it that way.

00:19:16.395 --> 00:19:17.265
I don't like it that way.

00:19:17.295 --> 00:19:18.135
You're not going to do.

00:19:19.399 --> 00:19:20.990
And this, this moment
for me and conviction.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.889
When I see Peter who will be the
rock of the church future, right?

00:19:24.889 --> 00:19:28.610
We know this in acts two, he begins to
be the rock, the one that sets and leads

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.770
off into the starting of the church.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.000
He rejects God.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.450
And God tells him, you will not be
a part of me if you reject this.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.450
And so then Peter quickly
says, no wash all of me.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:39.720
Right?

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.910
And so God goes into this other
thing, but I started think about this.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.270
It sounds a little bit narrow-minded
when God gives us a call in our lives

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.710
and we can either take it or leave it.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.610
That's really what Jesus said.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:48.600
Hey, you can take this or leave it.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.340
We want to think that
that's narrow-minded.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.670
But I want to give you an example
here, because this speaks to me

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.040
again, I'm a football guy, so I
see some football jerseys out here.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.210
This is going to be good for you guys.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:57.540
Right?

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.820
Think about a coach sitting down upon.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.930
Who is rejecting the plan, the game plan.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.550
He says, no, I don't
want to do the game plan.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.380
And the coach, here's what the coach says.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.750
He says, Hey, I know what's best for
the team because I see the whole team.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.970
I see how the team functions together.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.630
And I see that the health of the
team is for you to follow the plan.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.660
But if you don't choose to follow the
plan, you're hurting the whole team

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.730
and I'm going to have to set you out.

00:20:28.629 --> 00:20:32.199
Now, I don't know about you guys as a
player on a team where a coach has the

00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:36.459
full view and knows everybody's position
and knows how everything comes together.

00:20:36.459 --> 00:20:39.879
It's easy for me to say the
coach is right in that the coach

00:20:39.879 --> 00:20:41.320
is right in that guarantee.

00:20:41.439 --> 00:20:44.169
He is, Jesus is way bigger than a coach.

00:20:44.469 --> 00:20:48.189
Jesus sees everything in eternity,
past and attorney Ford, right?

00:20:48.189 --> 00:20:49.659
We know that he sees everything.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.000
He knows our roles on the team.

00:20:52.659 --> 00:20:54.189
He knows what plan you need to be.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.500
And sometimes God says, this
is your role and you reject it.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:01.460
I reject it.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.780
We say, oh, it's too much.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.990
It's not, it's not that person's,
I'm not the quarterback who gets all

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.850
the autographs and the big contracts.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.180
Tell me why the con the quarterbacks
nowadays is $40 million a year.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.010
And the kickers get three.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:19.220
I mean, come on, kickers one games all
the time, but that's not my choice.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.020
Go back to Jesus.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.780
It's not my choice, whether
I'm a kicker or the McCarter.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:28.860
It matters that one, I'm a child of
God and the God's given me a command.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.590
And, and really the, I think the
craziest part of this picture,

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.970
he's, he's willing to wash my feet.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.420
If someone who leads me is
willing to wash my feet.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:40.110
I'll probably follow him anywhere because
I know that he is humble and willing.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.440
Right.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.400
But he didn't just wash feet.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.450
He went to the cross for us.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:42.810
Right.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.130
So sort started thinking about that.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.480
So Jesus, again, is confident as
colon and leading them where to go.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.700
He can see the whole.

00:21:50.835 --> 00:21:53.865
And so here's what he's saying
to us when we reject gods,

00:21:53.865 --> 00:21:55.335
plaintiff's serving those around us.

00:21:55.485 --> 00:21:57.314
Cause again, that's
what Jesus' example was.

00:21:57.645 --> 00:22:01.215
If we reject God's plan of serving
those around us, to show them the love

00:22:01.215 --> 00:22:02.865
of Jesus, then we're hurting the team.

00:22:04.185 --> 00:22:07.935
See, after Jesus had confidence in his
calling and he served those around them,

00:22:08.235 --> 00:22:10.514
he didn't just serve them and walk away.

00:22:10.514 --> 00:22:13.365
He challenged them to follow his example.

00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:16.965
See, I want us to end this way, guys.

00:22:16.965 --> 00:22:17.445
I want us to end.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.600
Too many times in our lives,
we give our lives to Jesus.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.300
We have a relationship with Jesus.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.120
We may even live like a Christ follower
follower, but we do not take others

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:35.100
alongside of us and disciple them
to model after Jesus, Jesus said

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.540
go therefore and make disciples.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.590
We're missing.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.430
The greatest thing.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.100
If all we do is become a great
Christian that falls all the

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.760
rules and it's just, this is just,
I'm going to live out my life.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.280
But, but Jesus says no.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.379
Now go do likewise and then do it
again so that you can model it and

00:22:52.379 --> 00:22:53.790
teach and bring people into it.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.310
So he says to remember his
example, and this is where verses

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.660
12 through 17 come in, right.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.780
He says, when Jesus had washed their
feet and put them on the outer clothing,

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.690
he reclined again and said to them,
do you know what I've done for you?

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:09.420
You call me teacher and Lord, and you are
speaking rightly since that's what I am.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.240
So if, if I, your Lord and
teacher have washed her.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.880
You also ought to wash one another's feet.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.990
I think that's so important when we see
that we should wash one another's feet.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.870
So I'm going to ask this question
maybe, should we take our

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.010
shoes off today and wash feet?

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.090
Um, I'm not doing that by the way, but
you know that maybe the question, right.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.590
I started thinking about this, who
was the one person in that room?

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.800
The Jesus.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.930
If you were Jesus, you would
struggle to wash their feet.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.240
Somebody tell me, who's the one
person in that room you would

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:48.280
struggle to wash the feet of Judas
his enemy, the one who portrayed him.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.379
But Jesus, didn't say, Hey, do,
as I did, but avoid your enemies.

00:23:53.919 --> 00:23:55.060
He didn't skip it.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:55.840
Didn't say write that in.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.030
Hey, I skipped Judases because
he's going to betray me.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.379
He washed his feet guys.

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:02.270
He's a serve those around us.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:04.899
So we affirmed one more time.

00:24:04.899 --> 00:24:08.294
He says, Uh, servant is not
a greater than his master.

00:24:08.294 --> 00:24:08.655
Right?

00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:10.334
What does that mean?

00:24:11.715 --> 00:24:13.935
It's basically saying this,
his disciples are the servants

00:24:14.385 --> 00:24:16.185
and Jesus is our master, right?

00:24:16.425 --> 00:24:20.024
We're God's servants who they served.

00:24:22.094 --> 00:24:24.794
We should also serve
who God served through.

00:24:24.794 --> 00:24:25.274
Jesus.

00:24:25.274 --> 00:24:27.135
We should also serve
including our enemies.

00:24:27.405 --> 00:24:28.064
It's a no brainer.

00:24:29.695 --> 00:24:30.955
So I don't know.

00:24:30.955 --> 00:24:32.455
I, I started thinking
through this a little bit.

00:24:33.354 --> 00:24:34.615
I think it's more than just watching.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.530
I think it's more than washing feet.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.700
What Jesus was saying here.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:43.950
When we go back to communion that
time of the Lord's supper, he was

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:48.840
speaking of his body breaking and
his blood being poured out for us.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:54.510
That's the deeper picture of the model
that Jesus wants us to follow, not just

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.840
the wash one another's feet, but to
serve in such a way that may cost us.

00:24:58.935 --> 00:25:03.315
May cost us money may cost us
time may cost us our jobs because

00:25:03.315 --> 00:25:04.665
we begin to pursue a call.

00:25:04.784 --> 00:25:09.075
That's more than money, but it's
really more about God's kingdom.

00:25:09.135 --> 00:25:11.865
I don't know what it is that God
may be calling us to do, but he's

00:25:11.865 --> 00:25:13.305
calling us to sacrifice it all.

00:25:13.875 --> 00:25:17.504
So when Jesus' body was broken and
spilled out, he was really teaching us

00:25:17.715 --> 00:25:19.784
what verse 17, even kind of affirms here.

00:25:19.784 --> 00:25:21.315
Verse 17 says this.

00:25:21.945 --> 00:25:26.415
Um, it says if you know
these things, you're blessed.

00:25:26.415 --> 00:25:26.745
If you do.

00:25:27.465 --> 00:25:35.235
So we know that Jesus said to follow after
our master, who is Jesus in his example.

00:25:36.345 --> 00:25:40.514
So Jesus is asking us to serve those
around us, by laying down our lives for

00:25:40.514 --> 00:25:45.975
one another, even our enemies, there's
not one person in this world that we are

00:25:45.975 --> 00:25:50.895
to not lay our lives down so that they
can experience God's love and mercy.

00:25:51.825 --> 00:25:52.575
What does it take?

00:25:53.115 --> 00:25:53.715
Humility?

00:25:54.705 --> 00:25:55.274
How do we do that?

00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:00.190
We go back to verse three,
that we realize that everything

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:01.420
has been given into our hands.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.130
I started thinking if everything has been
given to our hands, even the ability to

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:11.200
humble ourselves when it's difficult,
has been given to us through Jesus to go

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.680
serve those around us, to the point of
possibly laying down our lives for them

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:20.560
as this is a tough text, because it's
not allowing you to get out of the call

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.360
of what a true follower of Jesus is.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:23.920
All of us are to lay down.

00:26:24.645 --> 00:26:29.715
Everything that hinders our walks and
begin to live our lives out for Jesus

00:26:29.865 --> 00:26:31.875
in such a way that others can know him.

00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:34.635
So I want to finish this way.

00:26:36.105 --> 00:26:39.765
I started asking this question, who's
the one another, you know, he says

00:26:39.765 --> 00:26:43.875
that he says, so if the Lord and
teacher have washed your feet, you

00:26:43.875 --> 00:26:45.795
also ought to wash one another's feet.

00:26:46.185 --> 00:26:47.535
So I already mentioned the enemy, right.

00:26:47.535 --> 00:26:51.465
But a lot of us probably want to take the
one another, and we want to find a loop.

00:26:52.875 --> 00:26:54.675
Who's the one another,
what do you guys think?

00:26:54.705 --> 00:26:57.254
Who's the one another
the guys talking about

00:27:02.274 --> 00:27:02.875
everyone.

00:27:04.045 --> 00:27:04.284
Sorry.

00:27:04.495 --> 00:27:05.425
I wrote it this way.

00:27:06.385 --> 00:27:14.205
Um, it's anyone, everyone all
started just thinking there's people

00:27:14.205 --> 00:27:15.345
in our lives that are difficult.

00:27:15.555 --> 00:27:15.915
We want to.

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.490
Uh, we, we just want to serve those
who bring us joy that we like.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:21.600
I'll tell you this.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.169
It's easy to invite a friend over
for dinner and provide food for them.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:26.250
Wow.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:26.760
I love him.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.350
And I should do that.

00:27:29.459 --> 00:27:31.409
Well, what about the
ones that look different?

00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:34.409
Act different, think different.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.080
They're the hardest ones to serve
and we avoid them, but Jesus

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.580
didn't, he didn't avoid you.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:46.990
Um, for us, you know, as a
church at churches and, and

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:47.980
again, I'll step out there.

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.560
A lot of times the church is
accused of not wanting to serve

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.330
the lost those who don't know Jesus
we're okay with coming on Sundays.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.820
We're okay with hanging out with their
friends that are Sable refusing to get

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.949
her in the lost and serve them first.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.629
Maybe not even with an agenda, but just
serving them to show them that you.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.169
And hoping that they see
Jesus through that, and maybe

00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:10.370
they'll spark a conversation.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.300
And one of the coolest things for me
in this conclusion is to see this we've

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.879
been serving for a year in schools.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:20.060
And we're just now starting to have
gospel conversations with some of

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.010
the staff and, and administrators.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:23.450
Why?

00:28:23.689 --> 00:28:27.110
Because we chose to serve people who
are different people who maybe didn't

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.189
believe the same thing as we did.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:33.050
But we started there even though
it was difficult, we chose to do.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.040
And we're seeing fruit of it.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:40.110
So today again, when we have time to take,
to remember what Christ has done for us

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:44.820
on the cross, it wasn't just to remember
his broken body and to remember the blood

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.410
that he poured out for us on the cross.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.590
But it's remember his example that
he left for us to go lay down our

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:54.210
lives for one another second, Peter
three nine really points to this.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.970
Who's the one another, the Lord does not
delay in his promise as some understand.

00:29:00.135 --> 00:29:04.935
But as patient with you not wanting
any to perish, but all to come to

00:29:04.935 --> 00:29:06.014
repentance, I'll say that again.

00:29:06.344 --> 00:29:10.784
God's desire is to not see any
perish, but all to come to repentance.

00:29:12.115 --> 00:29:14.544
So the one another that God has
called every one of us to serve

00:29:14.544 --> 00:29:19.405
to the point of possible death and
suffering is every person in our lives.

00:29:19.405 --> 00:29:20.215
We can't avoid them.

00:29:20.844 --> 00:29:23.245
If there's a person out there that
you want to avoid, you need today.

00:29:23.245 --> 00:29:27.054
As during this time of invitation
to ask the Lord to change your view.

00:29:28.215 --> 00:29:28.965
I started talking.

00:29:28.965 --> 00:29:31.485
I was talking to Jason and
Christina, uh, Friday night,

00:29:31.515 --> 00:29:32.625
they got to come over for dinner.

00:29:32.655 --> 00:29:34.635
And, uh, one of the cool
things, just God gave me this

00:29:34.635 --> 00:29:36.975
picture of putting on glasses.

00:29:37.425 --> 00:29:39.915
So those of you who wear glasses,
uh, see Parker back there,

00:29:39.915 --> 00:29:42.105
messing with his glasses, those
you wear glasses or contacts.

00:29:42.105 --> 00:29:42.825
You get the idea.

00:29:42.825 --> 00:29:45.495
If you don't put those
on things aren't clear.

00:29:47.595 --> 00:29:51.015
And so every morning we choose
not to put on this view that

00:29:51.015 --> 00:29:53.115
God has of everybody around you.

00:29:54.785 --> 00:29:55.535
Your vision is blurred.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:00.570
And you begin to see, sometimes
you have to guess what God

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:01.920
has clearly given you today.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:07.470
The lenses to put on who the one
another is it's everyone in our lives.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:14.280
So don't let your desires or the
things that you're struggling with.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.380
Stop you from loving one another
in this room, but outside

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:19.320
this room and those around.

00:30:20.745 --> 00:30:24.495
So today, as we take time to head into
limitation, there's, there's two things.

00:30:24.885 --> 00:30:27.585
And this is what I love about
invitations says that's a time to

00:30:27.585 --> 00:30:29.325
consider what God has taught you.

00:30:29.625 --> 00:30:33.765
I don't know if anything's made sense,
but I hope something has got us spoke.

00:30:33.795 --> 00:30:35.235
One thing maybe into your heart.

00:30:36.015 --> 00:30:38.085
And so during this time of invitation,
this is what we want to do.

00:30:38.085 --> 00:30:40.815
We've been wanting to give a
little bit more time for you guys.

00:30:41.515 --> 00:30:44.125
What do we call, do business with
the Lord, spend some time with the

00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:46.345
Lord and say, Lord, speak to me.

00:30:47.755 --> 00:30:51.295
Um, and so what Brock's going to do here
is he's going to play softly behind.

00:30:51.475 --> 00:30:53.995
We're going to close our eyes and
we're spend a few minutes just asking

00:30:53.995 --> 00:30:58.735
the Lord, Lord, what is it that you
want to take out of what we've learned

00:30:58.735 --> 00:31:00.925
today and apply to my life for you?

00:31:00.925 --> 00:31:03.595
Maybe it's sin that you need to
repent of, maybe it's you and

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:05.575
your view towards one another.

00:31:05.575 --> 00:31:08.785
Whoever that one another is,
who, whatever the Lord lays on

00:31:08.785 --> 00:31:09.925
your heart, consider what it is.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:12.000
And here's what the Lord promises.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.850
If we will repent, we'll
ask God to forgive us.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:21.300
He will quickly forgive us and view us
as though we've not never sinned before.

00:31:21.899 --> 00:31:23.429
So this is a time for,
to get your heart, right?

00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:25.500
Here's the other challenge
that I have with you.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.060
This is also a time for you.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.280
If you've never given your
life to Jesus, you don't know

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.540
what it means to follow Jesus.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.510
You've you've never made that
decision is for you to say,

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:34.740
Hey, I, I need to make that.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.130
I need to stop putting it
off and you can do that.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.630
And so I'm going to be in the bag.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:44.700
And so as Brock's plane is, as the
rest of us are praying and asking God

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.140
what it is that you're teaching us.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.320
If you need to give your life to
Jesus, come back and talk to me.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.370
I want to talk with you.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.730
And then after you guys are done
doing that, Brock will ask us to

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:57.360
stand and we'll spend some time
worshiping on our way out of service.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.220
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:31:59.970
We thank you Lord.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:00.600
For this time.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.590
Lord, we thank you for your word
and how it's truth and how it

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.540
seems like it's new every morning.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.389
And Lord, how you continue
to speak to every one of us.

00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:15.840
Lord, I pray that today our hearts and
minds were opened to your word, Lord.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.020
I pray that to every person in this room,
doesn't leave here before they apply.

00:32:20.745 --> 00:32:24.075
Your word to their hearts
and lives or decision area.

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:25.004
That's not right, Lord.

00:32:25.004 --> 00:32:27.495
I pray that they get it right, Lord.

00:32:27.495 --> 00:32:29.625
I pray if there's a person that
they have wrong, Lord, I pray

00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:30.764
that they go to that person today.

00:32:30.764 --> 00:32:33.314
They make a phone call and
they ask for forgiveness.

00:32:34.304 --> 00:32:36.254
Lord, I pray the Lord.

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:41.294
If they've not put on the correct
lenses in the past, but today they

00:32:41.294 --> 00:32:43.845
want to put on the right lenses
where they see people, the way you

00:32:43.845 --> 00:32:45.825
do broken and hurting and Anita.

00:32:46.935 --> 00:32:47.115
Lord.

00:32:47.115 --> 00:32:51.855
I pray that they put those on today,
but Lord, lastly, I pray if there's one

00:32:51.855 --> 00:32:56.265
person in this room that is questioning
their faith in you, or it does not

00:32:56.265 --> 00:32:58.455
have a relationship with you, Lord,
that they will not leave here today

00:32:58.455 --> 00:33:00.855
without giving their lives to you.

00:33:01.245 --> 00:33:04.575
So Lord, I pray that they get up
during this time and meet me in the

00:33:04.575 --> 00:33:08.385
back and they say, Hey, Ben helped
me know Jesus in a personal way.

00:33:10.125 --> 00:33:11.445
Lord, we love you.

00:33:11.985 --> 00:33:13.335
And we thank you for this time.

00:33:13.785 --> 00:33:14.475
We pray this in your hand.

00:33:15.485 --> 00:33:15.815
Amen.
