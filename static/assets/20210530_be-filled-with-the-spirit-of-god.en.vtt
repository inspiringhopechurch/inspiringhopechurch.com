00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.440
you don't feel good right it's just it's 
just not good for me i should have really  

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.720
went for probably the apple and maybe 
the sandwich and you know something  

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.800
maybe a little bit healthier today as we talk uh 
i want you to think of it this way paul is really  

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.360
giving these comparisons right darkness and light 
and today he's going to talk about a couple of  

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.480
different things but it's this idea behind we have 
this desire as believers we've been speaking to  

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.400
believe we have this desire as believers like we 
really want to know more about god we desire to  

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.720
be used for god but it's like in that moment 
it's like yes i want to but then we choose  

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.960
worldly things that really we go after them and 
we maybe we bid to watch tv rather than spend  

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.440
time with god right maybe we choose other things 
that just fulfill us outside of god and all of a  

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.720
sudden those things are just leaking let me just 
feel miserable and you're like why did i do that  

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.600
paul's really kind of even using that more today 
it's this idea behind a lot of the things that we  

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.960
choose is like a substitute to what should 
spiritually kill us will never fulfill us  

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.400
and that we should be filled with the spirit of 
god and that just analogy with food really just  

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.240
stuck out to me because i'm telling you 
guys there's something bernie knows this

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.680
uh when when i'm looking for something in 
the cabinet it seems like nine times out of  

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.000
ten i'm driving a handful rather than a banana 
right so it relates to me because i'm like i'm  

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.640
always choosing the wrong thing and then later i'm 
like why am i nodding out at 2 pm when i should  

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.440
be doing something all right it's best to make 
sure um but so let me catch you up a little bit  

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.800
so you can kind of know where we're heading today 
so a couple weeks ago we talked about this this  

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.800
idea is paid here for his attention to how we 
live right and there's this idea of be ready and  

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.400
i use the the analogy kind of of like a football 
player on defense rather than standing there and  

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.160
also when the play happens and then they respond 
they're ready they're in the ready position so  

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.320
paul's saying be careful how you live be ready 
prepared and these are the things we talked  

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.640
about the reasons why we should pay careful uh 
to have attention to how we live so the first  

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.160
one was it's a mark of wisdom i think it's this 
idea behind um one wisdom is something that i  

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.920
think all of us would like to have if we don't 
feel like we have it so it's a mark of wisdom  

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.560
um the other thing we learned is that life is 
short so as a believer we understand life is short  

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.480
we're not guaranteed tomorrow and so we should 
pay careful attention how we live because we want  

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.080
it to be lived for the right reasons and for the 
good of those around us and for the glory of god  

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.320
then he talks about the days are evil and this is 
more on the relationship side of those but maybe  

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.360
they're around us that don't know christ and the 
days are evil and it's only getting worse and we  

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.040
need to find them we need to pursue them we need 
to share the love of christ with him another one  

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.800
was that god has given us a mind to understand 
his will and so this kind of goes back to this  

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.160
whole idea of pay careful attention to how 
you live and we know that god wants us he's  

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.080
given us the mind to understand his will but 
again sometimes we're choosing other things  

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.880
rather than choosing the things of his will or 
knowledge of his will and the last one is because  

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.360
god has a plan for you so we should pay careful 
attention because god has a plan for you and i  

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.680
think that's the idea behind like you weren't 
made on accident god literally chose to allow  

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.680
you to be where you are today because he has a 
specific purpose for you and i always go back  

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.440
to that idea it's why don't we start this church 
what do we believe in issues we believe god has  

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.240
literally created you for a purpose and we want 
to help you discover that purpose every one  

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.400
of us writes and we're here and i even love our 
wednesday night group is because we're challenging  

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.040
each other to discover our purpose right and 
all comes through our relationship with jesus  

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.880
and so that's exactly what paul's pointing to 
but paul's going to continue to expand on this  

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.680
idea of be careful how you live and so he's going 
to say and he's been using this like unwise don't  

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.120
be unwise be wise he's saying don't be foolish 
right and he's going to expand a little bit more  

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.440
on that today he's going to kind of say this don't 
be reckless in how you live but be filled with the  

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.440
spirit we're going to talk about what fulfilled 
what the spirit is because sometimes a little bit  

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.320
confusing on exactly what's that mean because 
for me i think in my mind i thought there was  

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.400
only one type of like at the moment of salvation 
you have the spirit of god over well there's an  

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.720
idea of what filled with the spirit is and so 
paul's going to kind of just expand on this  

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.160
through these couple of verses um three evidences 
that we are filled with the spirit i think this is  

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.840
i mean you guys are probably like me it's like 
i want to know if i'm successful with something  

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.840
so i kind of want to know some markers in 
my life and that's kind of paul's saying hey  

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.760
here's some markers in your mind to know if you're 
filled with the spirit we're going to address two  

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.800
of those today that is that you're joyful and 
thankful the last one is that you're submissive  

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.920
and that's going to be a fun one we're 
going to jump off into relationships  

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.240
um next week as it deals with marriage 
builds with kids and things like that  

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.400
and so we'll explain more on that 
but today i want us to start reading  

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.960
in verse 15 so that it all kind of flows together 
so ephesians chapter 5 we're starting verse 15  

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.320
but we're really going to be talking mainly 
verses 18 through 20 21 a little bit today  

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.960
so it says this pay careful attention then to 
how you live not as unwise people but as wise  

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.560
making the most of the time because the days 
are evil so don't be foolish but understand  

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.400
what the lord's will is and don't get drunk with 
wine which leads to reckless living but be filled  

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.160
by the spirit speaking to one another in psalms 
and hymns and spiritual songs singing making music  

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.320
with your hearts to the lord giving thanks always 
for everything to to god the father the name  

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:41.120
of our lord jesus christ submitting to 
one another in fear of christ so when we  

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.440
look at this the first verse in verse 18 is paul 
saying don't be reckless don't be reckless and so  

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.040
when you think about this verse and the more that 
i spent time reading this verse it's kind of stuck  

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.400
in the middle of all the paul's talking about it 
kind of seems out of place but i began to study it  

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.200
a little bit more and it's really this idea behind 
fault to talk about you know don't be unwise be  

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.920
wise and now he's saying don't be reckless or 
uncontrolled but it says be controlled or be  

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.160
um filled with the spirit and then i think 
you guys can probably understand that idea  

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.040
behind what bug control or what control is i think 
about this it's probably like our three-year-old  

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.440
during worship services uncontrolled right he's 
just running around and that's great again that's  

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.680
what we expected a three-year-old and then we 
think of controlled a mature adult right sometimes  

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.040
but you kind of get that idea so when we 
think about this verse right here when he says  

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.320
and don't get drunk with wine 
which leads to recklessness  

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.080
most of us if we haven't experienced drunkenness 
has seen someone drunk so let's talk about the  

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.960
idea of what does a drunk person act like so you 
guys help me out what's the drunk person i play

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.280
stupid okay out of control

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:01.840
slow

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:15.840
yes

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.240
right so so you know there's several things 
that we think about like what is has a drunk  

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.240
person or what do they say right so they tend 
to say things that they normally wouldn't say  

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.760
they tend to be free with their emotions or 
their thoughts or their actions um and so i  

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.960
mentioned this it seems like everything's always 
funnier when someone's drunk right so it's funnier  

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.160
and here's what the bible says i want you guys to 
turn to proverbs chapter 23 if you have your bible  

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.080
uh turn there if you have your phone 
turn there if you don't have anything  

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.200
it's okay i'll read it but i want 
you to turn proverbs chapter 23  

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.120
because the the bible speaks directly to what 
this just so you know this the sermon isn't  

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.960
just about drunkenness but it is good for us to 
understand the idea of uncontrolled and controlled  

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.360
what drunkenness is and why it's not 
wise to be drunk and things like that  

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.360
so proverbs chapter 23 um starting in verse 
29 if you guys have found that say yes

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.360
all right so it says this who has woe or who has 
sovereign who has conflicts who has complaints  

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:31.440
who has wounds for no reason who has red 
eyes those who linger over wine those who  

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.560
go looking for mixed wine don't gaze at 
wine because it's red because it gleams  

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:42.240
in the cup and goes down smoothly in the end it 
bites like a snake and it stings like a viper  

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:48.160
your eyes will see strange things been there 
and you will save certain things you'll be like  

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.760
someone sleeping out at sea and lying down on the 
top of the ship's mast and they instruct me but i  

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.200
feel no pain they beat me but i didn't know when 
i wake up i'll look for another drink so when we  

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.920
see this we're seeing this idea of it it's really 
not beneficial right it's it's reference to this  

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:12.000
it bites like a snake it seems like a viper that's 
not two things i want i don't know about y'all i  

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.920
don't really want that um and so it's just a clear 
idea behind like what is our life's like and i  

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:23.600
and the one thing that i think that's interesting 
with this proverb is it really hits the heart when  

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.880
he says this don't gaze at wine because it's red 
because it gleams in a cup and goes down smoothly  

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.880
see drinking is appealing drunkenness is actually 
killing because the idea is it helps me become  

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.880
the person so just loading my past life that 
helped me became the person that i knew i wasn't  

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.760
but i thought other people would like right so 
it becomes appealing to to be drunk and and even  

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.000
the proper person who's reading this proverb 
is saying the same thing but in comparison  

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.160
to being controlled by alcohol right is the other 
side right being controlled by the spirit of god  

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.040
um and when we think about this and paul's 
speaking to believers he's saying hey go back  

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:09.760
to basically chapter 5 verse 1 he says imitate god 
imitate god as dearly loved so as imitators of god  

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.960
we want to be under control not out of control 
as someone who would be drunk and so proverbs 20  

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.760
verse 1 even says a little bit more about this 
it says wine is a mocker and beer is a brawler  

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.120
whoever goes astray because this is not wise and 
so it's just a reminder again paul is using wise  

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:31.200
and unlikes so as followers of jesus i would say 
we would want to be wise and so paul's just saying  

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:37.120
don't be unwise don't be uncontrolled but then 
the question is then how are we controlled how  

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:42.400
can we become controlled well he answered that 
question and he says they'll be drunk with one  

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.360
which leads to reckless living but be filled 
with the spirit be filled with the spirit  

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.760
so that's the opposite of being drunk 
with wine careless and out of control  

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.960
and so this is the question is what does it mean 
to be filled with spirit if you've been around  

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:03.440
other religions enough you've probably heard 
multiple things right for some they say hey you're  

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.120
baptized with the spirit that you filled with 
the spirit and there's multiple different things  

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.280
and paul actually speaks directly to one of those 
and so if you guys want to turn back ephesians  

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:22.640
chapter 1 verse 13-14 he actually answers the 
spirit's role in this he says in him speaking  

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:28.240
of god you were also sealed with the promised holy 
spirit when you heard the word of truth the gospel  

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.280
of your salvation and when you believed and the 
holy spirit is a down payment of our inheritance  

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.360
until the redemption of the possession is the 
praise of his glory so this basically saying this  

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.080
at the moment of salvation the spirit of god comes 
to live inside of you so if you're anything like  

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.920
me whenever you were a new believer and somebody 
says the spirit of god comes who lives in you  

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.840
you're like i'm not letting anybody like that 
sounds freaky really just simple it's just god  

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.720
living inside of you guiding and directing your 
life right helping to live a life that honors him  

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:04.480
right and so when we we think about this that 
happens at the moment of salvation but then he  

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.840
talks about being filled with the spirit in this 
situation so think about this it's spiritual fuel  

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:16.400
um when you guys you know go fill your car up is 
that the last time you ever fill your car up the  

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.880
rest of your life unless you don't drive i guess 
but it's not right so you're still driving which  

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.760
means you're gonna go back to to get more fuel so 
when we think about he's saying this fill yourself  

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.480
with this right to be filled with the spirit 
it really means to be constantly controlled  

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:38.240
basically by the spirit in our minds emotions 
and so so the question how do we do that and  

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.840
i started thinking about this so wednesday 
matt made this statement honestly a lot of us  

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.680
made some amazing statements on wednesday but it 
was this idea behind when we talk about prayer  

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:51.360
prayer surrender in order to be able to pray and 
be able to receive the lord's will we have to  

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:57.760
surrender which means we have to empty ourselves 
of ourselves into ourselves and basically give a  

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.960
place for god's will to come into our lives and so 
to be filled with the spirit is to daily surrender  

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:10.080
as a day we empty ourselves and invite god in 
his will to our lives to fill us up with the  

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.680
things that are what good the things that are 
beneficial the things that are controlled right  

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.080
and when we think about that jesus even modeled 
that in the garden that was one of the things i  

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.200
loved that we got stuck on wednesday jesus modeled 
that in the garden when he was praying and again  

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.680
he prayed for the cup to be pastored and he had 
that desire for to be passed from him but yet  

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.600
he surrendered to god's will and the only way he 
could do that is because he surrendered himself  

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:39.120
and i think about this we've been using this 
statement a lot lately it's like if you had  

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.280
one day to live one one day to live how would you 
live right and we began to talk about what that  

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.920
looks like and all of us a little bit a little 
bit different see jesus knew we had one more  

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.400
day to live and and let me ask this question to 
you how did jesus live that last day of his life

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.360
seem to remember

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:05.360
praying okay he spent time with his disciples 
poured into people he did everything he could  

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:12.880
until his last breath to expand the kingdom of god 
to do the lord's will it took surrendering all of  

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:18.160
himself and i think about this because a lot of 
times we think very similarly if i've only got  

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:24.080
24 hours to live i'm going to go live it up see 
jesus didn't find himself at the bar drinking he  

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.840
didn't find himself at disney world which i know 
no offense that we just think about disney world  

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.760
like we're going to do that right but he didn't 
find himself there right he found himself wanting  

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:39.200
to till the end make sure that everybody he knew 
knew the last command and to pray and to surrender  

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.000
himself and that's not easy just to be honest guys 
it's not easy when we think about that because  

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:51.120
we're born and selfish we're born to really 
want what we want and so as a follower of jesus  

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:58.640
this is paul speaking to again followers of jesus 
it's a daily process of surrendering ourselves and  

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:06.560
then basically picking up our cross daily to 
imitate god and so when we think about this in  

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:12.240
order to to live and imitate christ we have to 
be filled and controlled by the spirit and so  

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:19.760
let me ask this because i i'm hoping all of us 
can catch some input to this how can we daily be  

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:25.120
filled with the spirit what are some things that 
we can do to fill ourselves with the spirit of god

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:39.840
read his word okay

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.200
what else can we refill the spirit again

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.960
this goes along with grain but

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.200
yeah basically what i would say everything you 
guys are saying is correct is this it's this  

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:12.320
idea that how are we filled with the spirit 
of god you're dividing him into every place  

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:19.840
that you go in every activity and so that's 
in every conversation you have that's in every  

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.720
activity you do that's then again how do you fill 
ourselves with the spirit of god it is through his  

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.800
word and prayer because here's the other thing the 
opposite of that it goes back to the whole when  

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:37.040
we are hungry we fill ourselves with either junk 
or healthy stuff right we choose godly things to  

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:42.560
fill ourselves with rather than worldly things to 
fill ourselves with so when paul's talking about  

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:48.800
feeling yourself rather than the thing that is 
not good for you drunkenness which is what he said

00:16:53.040 --> 00:17:00.000
yourself with the spirit of god the spirit um who 
is living inside of you to control you and guide  

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.720
you and direct you and so when we think about 
this i started looking at colossians if you guys  

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.680
don't know this i just learned this 
even recently so colossians the book  

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.840
of colossians was wrote around the exact 
same times ephesians and there's a lot of  

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.200
cross-references which means paul's saying a 
lot of the same things to the same group of  

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.000
people but he said a little bit different 
in colossians chapter 3 verses 16 and 17  

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.960
as paul was writing that letter he said this 
let the word of christ dwell richly among you  

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.120
so that's just again him saying the word of god 
should dwell inside this right when we think about  

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.760
the spirit living inside of us it's the word of 
god he says in all wisdom and teaching admonishing  

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.320
one another through psalms and hymns and spiritual 
songs singing to god with gratitude in your hearts  

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:45.440
and whatever you do and word indeed do everything 
in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god  

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:52.000
the father through him and so this is just a 
reminder and i had to read over this and process  

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.520
this and stick this in my brain is the people of 
god can know they're filled with the spirit of god  

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.120
when they get into the word of god let me 
answer that and say one more time and answer  

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.760
why that's true so the people of god can know 
they are filled with the spirit of god when  

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.280
they get into the word of god here's the reason 
why when you get in the word of god it's in here  

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.120
so sometimes we don't realize we read we read 
the word of god we don't look at it as a mirror  

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.800
but it really it's looking and saying is this 
evident in my life whatever i'm reading is  

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.640
this evident in my life negative or positive 
right we're seeing the word talk about sin  

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.320
is it evident in my life is it something to change 
or am i looking at and going oh this is actually a  

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:36.240
part of my life so it's affirming or convicted 
so it's a mirror but it's also a guide in that  

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.720
it's a guided map and it's been a guided map 
for my life the last 11 years i tell people this  

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.200
when i give my life to christ i jumped 
all in i literally got a reading plan  

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:51.360
and it was a piece of paper and every day during 
my work at lunch i would read and mark off and  

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.120
read because i wanted to know what the word got 
i needed a map i didn't know here's the thing i  

00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:01.520
had no clue how to live the christian life but i 
had one thing that i could do outside of praying  

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.640
was read the word of god and so it was a guide 
and a map to my life and it really challenged  

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.120
me because there was a lot of areas that i was 
like oh man i don't know what this means and i  

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.320
don't understand how this applies and i would 
ask questions and i would try to apply it right  

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:20.480
begin trying to leave those things out and so um 
we see that that that is so important right so  

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:25.520
there's there's so many ways it can be filled 
with the spirit of god but then we talk about  

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.800
this if you say okay i'm filling myself with the 
spirit of god here's the question how do we know  

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.200
that we are filled with experience we're reading 
the word we're praying but i don't want you guys  

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.560
there sometimes i read and pray out of check marks 
rather than out of really gaining something so  

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.280
if we want to know if it's working we need to 
go through the word of god and we need to see  

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.920
in the mirror whether that's true so paul 
actually gave us a couple of those examples  

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:57.200
in these these verses so verse 19 says these fun 
things and you guys will think the same thing is  

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.360
just speaking to one another in the psalms and 
tens i'm i'm not sure i've done that with y'all  

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.640
um but he says he put together psalms and hymns 
and spiritual songs and singing and making music  

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.560
with the heart with your heart to the lord 
in essence basically this is what paul's  

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.800
saying is that you're joyful you're excited 
anybody ever wake up with a song in the heart  

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:24.720
and you just start seeing it throughout the day 
right it becomes just this like pretty way costly  

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.560
it seems like i'll come in from working out i'm 
singing something she's singing something it's  

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.280
all about this song right that that guy's put 
on your heart you're you're joyful and a lot of  

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:39.200
times when i'm singing those songs it's because 
i should be reminded to be joyful i need to be  

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.840
reminded to be joyful so joy when we think 
about this so in galatians i think it's fine  

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.600
it talks about the fruits of the spirit which is 
the result of the spirit of god living inside us  

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:53.600
one of those is joy so joy comes from being 
filled with the spirit and it's not based upon our  

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.080
circumstances this is one of the things that paul 
modeled paul modeled that joy is not based upon  

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:06.400
circumstances and i love this example joy is not a 
thermostat do you even know what a thermostat does  

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:16.720
it measures the temperature in the room so if 
circumstances are bad my joy is are good my joy is  

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:24.160
high right that that's not how joy is from uh the 
fruit of the spirit it's a it's it's a thermostat  

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.920
it's not thermometer it's a thermostat i may 
have said that completely backwards but it's  

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.320
a thermostat so thermostat actually sets the 
control right so no matter how cold it gets  

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:39.200
outside i can set it at 70. it can be warm right 
so we allow joy the spirit of god inside of us  

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.160
to set the standard to set how we're going to view 
circumstances and paul even talked about this in  

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:49.520
philippians 4 where he says i have learned to be 
content and whatever circumstances i am in myself  

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.480
so paul didn't just say hey be joyful 
you need to sing songs and hymns together  

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.840
but you need he says i modeled the three 
look at me i'm writing this letter in prison  

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.960
to you and i'm saying to have joy and he's 
proven uh how important it is to have joy  

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:12.160
and i think about brittany you may remember this 
we had a guy by the name of frank um we had some  

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.200
different theological issues but he always 
would come to my wednesday night class and  

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.160
he would challenge me a little bit but here's one 
thing with frank i don't remember him being sad  

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.480
most of the time i would say hey frank 
how you doing hey brother i'm doing great  

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.640
god is good like every time i saw him i'm like 
like i don't like this guy because i like to kind  

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.360
of be down a lot like i just like it depending on 
if it's in a rainy day i'm gonna be down he's just  

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.480
everything's good right and so he kind of reminded 
me of that like he was somebody who had joy  

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.840
and it seemed like in every circumstance and 
every time i was talking negative he would  

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:50.000
always remind me now brother and so brother 
god's blessed you he kind of helped me remind  

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.840
me of these things it's hard to to do that it is 
hard to do that um but i look at these two verses  

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.800
right he's talking about being joyful uh we're 
seeing the psalms and his to one another right  

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.680
when i think about the difference between verse 
18 and verse 19 we're really talking about the  

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.440
difference between a spirit-filled person and 
a person that is drunken so let's talk about  

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.880
what each one of them is under control so from 
a from a person who's drunk is under control  

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.840
by alcohol right not by god but alcohol they're 
not ashamed to express themselves most of time  

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.960
and i'm really not in an honorable way right and i 
think about this it's joy brought on by substance  

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.320
sometimes we're having fun when we're drunk 
but it's really a joy brought on by substance  

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.520
and it ends up being an impressive later on 
when we look about the spirit-filled persons  

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.120
they're under control by god is not ashamed 
to express themselves in a way that honors god  

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.360
with joy when we think about someone 
who's drunk they're out of control  

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.160
because it affects the brain ends up saying and 
doing stupid things when we look at somebody who  

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.480
is spirit-filled they're self-controlled 
just one of the fruits of the spirit  

00:23:53.840 --> 00:24:00.160
which is really god in control right saying 
and doing things that honor god when we look  

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.960
at someone who's drunk it's really someone who 
calls attention to themselves when we look at  

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:10.400
someone who is spirit-filled is calling attention 
to christ and i want us to look at a spirit-filled  

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:15.680
person and what a spirit-filled person has 
done and when we look through the book of acts  

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.320
the result of someone who says that they're filled 
with the spirit and what happens next and so if  

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.160
you guys have your bibles with you i want you 
to turn a couple different places in acts we're  

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:30.400
gonna start with acts 431 i know i got you guys 
using your bible labs or your bibles a lot more  

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:35.360
today but trust me it's value because i'm hoping 
that you understand this god's word is truth  

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:43.200
and it helps affirm a lot of things in our lives 
and reminds us what is important so acts 4 31  

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.360
says this it says that when they had prayed 
the place where they had assembled was  

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:55.120
shaken and they were filled with the holy 
spirit and begins to speak the word of god  

00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:04.080
boldly let's look at another one just flip over to 
chapter seven of acts and look at verses 55 and 56  

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.720
it says this it says and stephen full of the holy 
spirit gaze into heaven and he saw the glory of  

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:16.320
god and jesus stand at the right hand of god and 
he said look i see the heavens open and the son of  

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:21.520
man standing at the right hand of god these are 
the last words that were said by stephen before  

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:26.960
he was sewn and as we know he was filled by the 
spirit before him because he was speaking boldly  

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.760
for christ then let's look at acts chapter 
13 it's the last one acts chapter 13

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:40.880
verses 9 and 10 it says but saul also called paul 
filled with the holy spirit stared straight at  

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.640
and said you are full of all kinds of disease and 
trickery your son you are the son of the devil and  

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.360
the enemy of all that is right won't you ever 
stop perverting the straight and narrow paths  

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:57.680
of the lord so we see these three instances and 
there's more that they were filled with the spirit  

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.960
and they spoke boldly so someone who's 
filled with the spirit doesn't fall  

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.840
back they stand up they speak up and i think 
about this so when we're talking about okay  

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.120
i know i'm supposed to be controlled i know that 
i'm supposed to be filled with the spirit we know  

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.080
being filled with the spirit comes from 
a relationship with jesus let's just make  

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:21.600
that simple a relationship with jesus and if it 
comes to a relationship with jesus how do i know  

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:28.160
that my relationship is actually a relationship or 
just a contract right something i'm just obligated  

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:35.280
to do or something that i desire to do when we 
start looking am i speaking up boldly for christ  

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:41.280
am i joyful in my conversations in my 
relationships with others am i speaking  

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:49.440
from the stance of of confidence in what christ 
is doing despite my circumstances sometimes i'm  

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.920
just telling you i actually kind of circled 
this i'm probably failing on the joint side  

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.920
there there's a lot of times i'm missing that mark 
i'm going back and i'm asking myself this question

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.880
am i filling myself with the spirit of god am 
i filling myself really with self-doubt worldly  

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:10.480
things that doesn't benefit me and doesn't help 
me overcome that but paul goes on and he says  

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.080
okay there's one more and there's more but he's 
just in these couple of verses he goes on so we're  

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:20.240
back here in ephesians chapter five and he talks 
about verse 20 where he says we should give thanks  

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.520
always for in everything or for everything to god 
the father in the name of the lord jesus christ  

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.160
so an evidence that spiritual 
persons also be thankful  

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.840
and a thankful person is usually 
humble and acknowledges god  

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.000
the provider of everything they've received 
and so want to take just a couple of minutes  

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:44.960
if a spiritual person is thankful what are you 
thankful for what are you thankful for family

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.840
thankful for your husband

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.880
that was awkward sorry

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.840
what are you guys thankful for

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.840
ice cream

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.720
so okay now let's take this so  

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.080
sometimes when you're asked this question what 
do you think before you like you start processing  

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:31.920
you start like listing these things off but how 
often during the day do you stop and thank god  

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:40.400
is it once a day is it just during your breakfast 
lunch and dinner prayers that you pray thank god  

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:46.400
or is it consistently and are you thinking and 
based upon only the good are you thinking him  

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.920
because he's still good even though what you're 
seeing are experiencing isn't necessarily guilty  

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.840
see this is where we talk about a spiritual person 
doesn't look around at their circumstances right  

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:04.400
many of us say that we're thankful but paul 
is specific and this is where i had to kind  

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.920
of go back and say well i'm thankful 
but then paul said giving thanks always  

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:16.000
for everything is there any thing that could 
happen in your life where you should be thinking

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:24.080
sorry paul's saying no everything 
and everything and always

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.800
and you haven't you weren't raised where i was 
raised you weren't here and the truth was i wasn't  

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.160
i wasn't but here's what paul is 
saying everything you can be thankful  

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:45.280
and and it really just reminds me 
this is this this idea is is that  

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.000
if you might mean you look at a 
lot of life with the glass actually  

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.600
right you're going to look at the negative we are 
drawn to the negative in everything but there are  

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:01.360
so many positives and so in every situation 
and in all things as endorsement as a believer  

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
in christ one who has given us salvation when he's 
given us life once given us the ability to be used  

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.720
for its glory and love and patience and mercy all 
these things right in any situation you could stop  

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.440
get out of pen a piece of paper and you can write 
down all the negative things of the situation but  

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.000
then you could write down all the good things of 
god that you can be thankful for i guarantee you  

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
it will outnumber everything that is made that's 
why paul says in all things and in everything you  

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.280
can give things it's a mark it's a mark of a 
spiritual person and so these are things where  

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.840
my encouragement always with these things is you 
can either look at this until defeated and be like  

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.000
man i'm such a poor christian i guess i'm just not 
even fit to be a christian that's not what paul is  

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.480
saying here's a false name it's encouraging 
if this isn't a mark of your life it can be  

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.600
and and i'll just tell you if we can have joy in 
all social services and we can be thankful for  

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.880
situations it will help us he's saying this 
is beneficial for me it's not beneficial to  

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:04.400
live a reckless life it's beneficial to live a 
controlled and consistent thankful and enjoyable  

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:11.920
see i'll i'll give you a great example where i 
felt um and it's not the only time that i'll fell  

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:17.920
right so this year i called 2021 see 2020 was 
the year at the pandemic 2020 in our house is  

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.360
the year of the dentist the year of the days 
24 minutes already i can't miss anything  

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:29.600
2021's the year of the days we've had three 
room announcements multiple business visits paid  

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.320
just got braces and so this is the moment where 
i want to complain right because you all know how  

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.680
much all that is if you've been to the dentist 
you know which one it is i want to complain  

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:45.120
this is stupid you know right no i'm just 
telling i want to complain that your wife

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:06.000
you know god provided a stimulus right and so we 
can also thank our president and we can thank him  

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
as well right we can also thank god because he 
provided that that student's money let's pay for  

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.280
every one of our next things and i can complain 
because man that money was sitting there in the  

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:19.280
bank we were going to use it on other things but 
god's saying no like i provided for like we want  

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:24.080
to complain you guys like what i'm providing 
for you why are you complaining and it's like  

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:30.480
i guess you're right like you know i didn't even 
think about that but i'd like to complain right  

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:36.720
so this is just a reminder that i felt and in all 
circumstances i can give things and i it's easier  

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:42.080
and just this rhythm what we have to create is 
when things don't go the way you want start off  

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.720
with thanksgiving start off with thanking god 
for everything you can possibly think of and  

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.680
if you run out of things open the word of god and 
start reading scripture and start thinking for it  

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.880
and when you're done you'll probably forget 
you're complaining and i need to tell myself  

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.200
that and i hope that maybe this helps you 
because maybe you struggle with the same thing  

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:09.840
so he's saying here again um so this was 
interesting we talked about this last week verse  

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.280
17 uh two weeks ago it says so don't be 
foolish but understand the lord's will  

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:19.840
and we want to know what the lord's will is first 
thessalonians 5 18 says in everything give thanks  

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.960
for this is the will of god and so it's just 
affirming the will of god is for us to be  

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:32.800
thankful so we can't let our circumstances 
dictate how thankful we are or how joyful we are  

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.840
we need to understand that 
we can always be thankful  

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.640
and so i want to kind of finish up this way 
and today i feel like i've just been speaking  

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:50.160
a lot i'm not really preaching i don't know 
maybe i'm just not moved to preach like just  

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:56.720
crazy emotional today um but i want to share with 
you just a couple things as we kind of finish up  

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.920
today and this idea of spirit-filled relationships 
yes maybe your parents weren't this way but i  

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.880
remember my parents but was there some things 
that your parents didn't let you do as a kid  

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:10.560
like i mean like i want to go hang on with 
my friends and they're like no and i'm like  

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.200
wow like it's not good for you and you're like 
complaining and you're frustrated with it right  

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.880
and then you get older and you look back and 
especially if you have kids now you're going

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.800
thinking through that when i was looking at this 
message but if you're anything like me as a kid my  

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:37.280
parents said did not do a lot of things and i did 
it anyways and then i began to think through how  

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:42.960
that affected my life how that affected my life in 
such a negative way the paths that i went down the  

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.520
things that i saw and the things that i did were 
not valuable for me and i'm like you know i would  

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:53.520
have been good to listen to my parents it would 
have been good to not do that um so let me kind  

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.200
of share my story and then just a little bit of 
story with with the whole idea behind how it falls  

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:03.760
at 14 is when i started drinking and my brother 
was six years old um and so he thought it was cool  

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:09.200
and if i went with him he'd let me dream right 
so that's where i started um and i did that up  

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:14.640
through a little bit of my teenage years and into 
my early 20s and that was where i spent my life on  

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.520
the weekends is we were looking for a place to go 
to if we're going to go to somebody's house it's  

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.040
friday night saturday night it's i'm drinking 
right that was the whole point because that's  

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:28.320
the only thing that was fun and people liked 
me it was exciting why not go to those things  

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.200
until i found jesus um and i remember this 
i wrestled for a year with my salvation  

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.360
and and i rested for a year because there's 
a lot of things i didn't want to give up and  

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:44.320
one of those was alcohol and here's the thing 
nobody on sunday morning to give up alcohol  

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:50.960
and but it was the lord the lord told 
me that you can't follow me if that  

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.200
is what you still think you need to bring 
you joy if that's what you think you need  

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:03.520
to be liked and to have fun be exciting and 
i remember after gave my life to christ and i  

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:09.600
think we went back to one more party we walked 
away we can't do this this is not who we are  

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.960
and it was nothing against them it's just god 
had brought in our lives that was just not  

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:22.080
beneficial for us it was not valuable because it 
was reckless living and so for me i feel like that  

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:28.320
we chose and i choose to stand for my whole 
not because i have to and this is not about  

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:33.120
is drinking the same cause drinking is not a 
drunken incidence but for me i just realized i  

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.680
didn't need it the spirit of god fulfills me the 
spirit of god fulfills me and just so you know  

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.240
i struggle with other things right social media 
sometimes i just go to social media whenever i'm  

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:46.960
feeling struggling right so it's like i don't have 
other issues but just speaking to this one issue  

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.360
and i think it's one i felt like i wanted our 
whole church to understand my stance i don't train  

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.000
and it's not because i think it's 
a sin i think drunk was a sin  

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.320
but for me i just don't find value in him and 
and when i look at what paul's saying paul's  

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:05.600
saying there isn't value in drunkenness and then 
i think about this at what point do we understand  

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:11.360
what drunkenness is and i think that was my 
struggle as a believer is at what point is it a  

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.000
buzz or drunkenness and if you go to some science 
there's a buzz driving in strong driving right so  

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.640
what is the line um and i think about this quote i 
shared with you guys a couple of months ago i was  

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:27.120
praying a month again it was why resist temptation 
in the future when you eliminated today why resist  

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:32.480
impatient in the future today and just so you 
hear my arguments this is not speaking directly  

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:39.040
to alcohol as much as it's speaking to the things 
in which are reckless they're not valuable for us  

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.120
they cause us to be out of control why do 
we choose them why do we allow them to even  

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:48.000
be around for one day and entrapping us in 
sin and the things that god called us to  

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.720
so when we look at this and as paul kind of 
summarizes this paul is saying don't live a  

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.680
reckless life don't live a reckless life live 
one that is controlled by the spirit of god

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.560
and we should be controlled 
in such a way that we have joy  

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.720
and we have thankfulness and we have boldness no 
matter what the circumstance we should know about  

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.680
things in that would cause us to be distracted 
from those things and i'll be the first one to  

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:19.360
say i'm guilty of allowing that to happen and 
this is convicting to me that i need to even find  

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:24.080
some areas of my life which i'm allowing to 
control me and say it's not worth it it's reckless

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.600
so you're heavenly father let me kind of 
go back to this whole thing with my parents  

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.040
right my parents didn't let me go hang with 
friends whenever i thought i should have  

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.200
hung out with friends and all these 
things so we have a heavenly father  

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.440
that is looking out for you and he's given us 
his word and he's saying this based on all that  

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:49.280
i've done all that i've done for you that's what 
we've really based all of ephesians four and five  

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.160
off of that's all that god's done for us based on 
that we should live in a way that imitates christ  

00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:02.240
we should we should led by the spirit inside 
us rather than living with the influences of  

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.760
the world that destroys us and that causes 
us to be reckless and i just i look at this  

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.320
and i'm saying it's god our father being 
my parents back when i didn't want to  

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:18.240
listen to my parents and it's time for me to 
mature up and say this is my heavenly father  

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.600
that's speaking to me through his word 
and he's telling me quit living reckless  

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:28.160
quick it's not valuable for you it's not good for 
you i want you to go and live as a child of christ  

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.880
don't let anything distract you so if you 
want to make your life count and this is  

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.040
just a challenge to myself as i live you want 
to make your life count if you want to influence  

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:42.960
others for christ you want to change the world it 
starts with being controlled by the spirit of god  

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:48.880
the relationship with jesus i don't know where 
your relationship with jesus is right now i don't  

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:53.520
know if you're struggling i don't know what you're 
um dealing with at all but what's your response  

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.920
today that's the question what's your to that at 
the end of every message and every time you study  

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:04.960
that word you should ask this question what is god 
asking me to do what is he speaking to me about  

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:10.560
how does this apply to me what does this mean and 
so that's what we'll do so during the invitation  

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:16.560
i just want you to ask god this question god 
how does this message speak to me what in this  

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:22.320
text do i need to take home with me is it to have 
joy in all circumstances because you want to be a  

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:27.040
spiritual person be thankful in all circumstances 
and if those are the two things you wanted to be  

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:31.280
bold in your faith and those are the three things 
you want it starts with a relationship with jesus  

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:37.040
and and so if you don't have a blessing of jesus 
i want to challenge you with this it starts today  

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:43.200
today's the day of salvation if we if we think 
about what paul's all been saying here your life  

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:49.280
is short there's no guarantees for tomorrow so i 
just challenge you with this i'm gonna be up here  

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:53.040
come talk to me if it's after service come talk 
to me and say i want to know jesus i want to give  

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.080
my life to jesus because today is the day 
of salvation today is the day to make that  

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.400
right with god and begin to grow your 
relationship with him to be spirit filled  

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:08.640
but then what about the person who knows jesus how 
does this text abide maybe it's just very similar  

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:13.200
to me right his word we're living this life 
where we know there's just some things we need  

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:20.480
we need to say it's not good for us god's 
word already says that we need to come to  

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:25.600
the conclusion that our heavenly father is right 
it's just not god and we need to turn it over  

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:30.480
to him and you ask god to forgive us and you know 
what i love about our heavenly father he says okay  

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:36.240
you know he doesn't hold it over your head i like 
to hold things under people's heads because that's  

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:43.520
just sometimes my nature and it's bad but god does 
he says you are forgiven so take this time to your  

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:50.640
invitation that go before the lord says seek me 
know my heart help me turn from my wicked ways  

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.840
and surrender my life fully to 
you so that you can fill it up  

00:41:54.800 --> 00:42:00.560
spirit-filled today and every day for his glory 
for our good and so that others may know him  

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:05.440
because that's what we're here for right all 
right let's pray lord jesus we love you lord  

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:14.560
i pray lord today that your words vote for 
because um i struggle to speak lord i pray  

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:23.680
today that your will is known lord that your will 
is to be thankful in all circumstances god um

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.840
seek my heart lord during this time 
of meditation words seek my heart  

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:38.640
lord forgive me for the things in which lord are 
careless and i'm beneficial my life forward that  

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:44.800
i continue to cling on to lord thinking that that 
is more valuable than in spirit-filled life lord  

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:50.720
help me choose you every day and surrender 
myself every day lord i pray that you choose  

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.200
to help each person this room think through the 
lord in the process through their life's lord to  

00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:00.480
see what is valuable in my life to make that a 
priority to be controlled by the spirit of god  

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.880
lord i pray there's someone in this room that 
doesn't know your word they don't meet today  

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.440
before they do but if they can talk to being 
here they talk to somebody else in the room  

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:21.920
and they say hey i want to know jesus lord 
because that's the greatest relationship
