00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.280
so again one of the greatest things i think 
i should just everyone with the reason why i  

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.680
cherish you think about it with you anywhere you 
go on your phones so the holy bible is an app  

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.280
that i actually use um every day because then 
it's the easiest thing to grapple uh whenever  

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.360
i'm studying god's word so you can turn with us 
today in matthew chapter 28 verses 16 through 20.  

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.160
um this is going to be a very familiar passage 
but god just kind of gave me a word as we were  

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.040
playing a baptism celebration this text deals with 
baptism but it deals with so many other things and  

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.560
i want to spend some time talking about it but 
um i want to start off this way is uh and i think  

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.120
it's fitting for a couple of reasons one it's 
raining outside too we have badges today but how  

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.120
many of you all have had somebody dunk you in the 
pool and what i mean by dunk is they hold you down  

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.040
anybody anybody ever been held out by your friends 
or your older brother which are still bitter to  

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.160
this day because he used to hold me down and so 
it's that moment where you're held down to a point  

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.040
where you think you're never going to get another 
breath of your life and you're going to drown then  

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.200
you come up and then you breathe and suck in here 
like you haven't breathed in about a year right  

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.080
that idea behind man really when we think about 
breath we think about how precious that is and  

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.400
as we can even think about that if you actually 
go and research what you didn't even go out and  

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.720
research about anything but do you know that 
we take an average of 23 000 breaths a day  

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.240
23 000 breaths a day and if you start counting now 
you might see if that's true but for me i thought  

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.320
about maybe back to that day i probably took 
a couple of less breaths because i was holding  

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.280
the water but why am i even mentioning this this 
is this is something that again i was thinking  

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.600
why would i even mention this first of all um if 
you're being baptized today i'm not gonna hold  

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.920
you under water i promise number one number two is 
uh it's just a reminder uh the guys literally and  

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.800
it's crazy every moment we take a breath is a gift 
from god we're not guaranteed another breath yet  

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.240
god gives us one after the other the other after 
the other so that's a constant reminder of how  

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.960
much god loves you how much god cares for you how 
much god desires to know you it's a so what we're  

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.520
going to talk about today how much god is desires 
for you to know your purpose in this life and so  

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.160
um something that we talked about last week 
and this is why i felt a guy just kind of  

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.960
living in this way to talk this week is made 
this statement the two most important days  

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.600
in our lives are the moment that we 
were born and the moment we realized  

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.960
two most important days in your life and again 
i'm going to stop right there husbands if your  

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.680
wife sitting next to you probably might not like 
totally bring in native marriage as one of those  

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.400
two but let me let me get to this point here 
the two most four days your life is the moment  

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.760
you're born and the moment you realize why see i 
don't know if you're anything like me i remember  

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.840
asking this question especially as i got 
older because as a kid you just played  

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.520
but once you kind of got older you start to 
ask this question what's the purpose of life  

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.760
if there's no way i can guarantee that i'm going 
to be alive tomorrow because we know we don't  

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.200
control that then what's the purpose of life what 
why was i born and so today as we can celebrate  

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.280
five baptisms we're going to see where these 
people who would give in their lives to christ  

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.240
are really celebrating today that life that has 
changed is experiencing that second thing their  

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.960
purpose have a relationship with jesus and to help 
others know jesus so i hope you'll ask yourself  

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.920
that question like why was i maybe you already 
had that answer but if you don't hope today it'll  

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.120
either affirm the answer that you have or ever 
help you process through what that is and so  

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.760
again um matthew 28 verses 16 through 20 i'm 
going to go ahead and read those first and then  

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.480
just kind of walk through this text together so it 
says the 11 disciples traveled to galilee and to  

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.920
the mountain where jesus had directed them and 
when they saw him they worshiped but some died  

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.000
and then jesus came near and said to him all 
authority has been given to me in heaven on earth  

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.640
go therefore and make disciples of all nations 
baptizing in the name of the father and of the  

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.360
son and of the holy spirit teaching them 
to observe everything i have commanded you  

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.720
and remember i am with you always to the end 
of the age let's take some time to pray lord  

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.560
jesus thank you again for who you are lord how 
you brought us all together to celebrate lord  

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.240
life change and also celebrate who you are in our 
lives so lord i just pray that you take your word  

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.640
and then that truth lord that we hear today is 
um changes our lives no matter if we know you or  

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:40.160
we don't pray that it changes our lives and we 
leave here um following every day of our lives  

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.440
amen so let me catch you up there's there's a 
reason why we're here at the back of matthew  

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.840
28 and it's that moment where you may be like hey 
i feel like i just turned on a game that's in the  

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.200
fourth quarter and it's a tie ball game and i have 
no clue how they got there so let me just give you  

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.520
a brief kind of walk through the purpose of the 
book of matthew the book of matthew it's called  

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:09.280
the gospel's first gospel of the new testament 
and it's a story about jesus from his birth  

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.560
to the way that he lived through the way that he 
died on the cross again walking a perfect life  

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.320
the way he rose from the dead we're at this 
moment where jesus has come back to life and  

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.760
conquered death hell and grave and he's giving his 
disciples those who were his followers basically  

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.520
a last command he's felt like the greatest you 
know the greatest great commission is listed as  

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.720
the sermon normally preaching and so everything 
that happened here is i don't want to miss this is  

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.800
jesus coming to this earth which is god's son 
coming down from heaven saying hey i could have  

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.400
stayed there but i chose to come to earth to live 
amongst all of us which again that was 2000 years  

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.840
ago so if you're saying does he still live with us 
and the answer is yes through god's people sharing  

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.000
who he is and through his word but he came to this 
earth to prove to us one that he loves us that  

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.520
he chose to not leave us in our condition lost 
without a relationship with god he came to give us  

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.920
a relationship with god through his life his death 
his sacrifice on the cross and his resurrection  

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.440
proving that we can have again eternity with god 
but also a personal issue so i'm going to kind of  

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.280
move on from there but i wanted to kind of 
get just a little bit of a background kind  

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.480
of where we were with this but this last kind of 
conversation that he had with his disciples is one  

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.000
of the last conversations how many of y'all have 
had a conversation with somebody who's about to  

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.040
pass away usually some of their last dying words 
some of the most precious words because they mean  

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.200
so much because they know they have a little bit 
of time left so these are words when i hear this  

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.600
i just want to i want to listen in a little bit 
deeper because these are important words from  

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.920
jesus not just to his disciples but to every 
person that would take time to read it and so  

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.840
we see here right off the bat we talk about 
it says the 11 disciples travel to galilee  

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.240
to the mountain where jesus had directed 
him when they saw him be worshipped  

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.400
it's undoubtedly so who were the disciples 
right these were people who followed jesus  

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.840
on earth and at this point these men even after 
they followed jesus on earth at this point they  

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.240
had realized one thing right and one of the most 
important things in life that they've been born  

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.480
two they began to realize that following jesus was 
important but they were getting ready to hear the  

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.600
reason why they were going they were right here 
the reason why they were born and the reason why  

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.880
and so the way that jesus explains this is so 
cool and so i want us to look at this in verse 18  

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.600
where he starts to say this jesus came near to 
them and said he said jesus came near them and  

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.200
said so i i know this so i've actually today i was 
actually supposed to go coach a flag football team  

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.200
it's not going to happen it's raining and i'm 
kind of glad we're not doing it well the reason  

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.120
why i bring this up is i think about with my black 
world team is we're still young enough that every  

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.560
before every play i kneel down they circle around 
me and i say listen up now make sure you're paying  

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.840
attention because everybody needs to run their 
role and everybody needs to be a part of this to  

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.200
be successful today so basically i say come here 
listen right this is what jesus is doing this is  

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.200
his rally his huddle with his disciples to 
say hey listen up don't miss what i'm getting  

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:25.360
ready to tell you and this is what he says all 
authority has been given to me on heaven on earth  

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:34.320
at that moment they realized okay everything 
right all authority has been given to me  

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.120
and so when we think about this jesus is getting 
ready to tell them why they were born and they  

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.400
can't miss this number one thing that the only 
way in which they can fulfill that purpose  

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.080
why they're wrong the only way that you 
can fulfill the purpose of why you're born  

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.480
is if you understand the power and the authority 
that you go with that god gives you because if you  

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.840
try to go in your own power i've tried it before 
you're exhausted you'll fail and to be miserable  

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:08.160
but if you go in god's power and authority you'll 
be successful why because he has all power and  

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:15.280
authority over earth and for us right now the 
only thing i really have may just be with my kids  

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:23.120
that's not very much right so we look at this 
again all authority all this complete control  

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.280
has been given to jesus any and think about this 
anybody remember just if you don't think of old  

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.040
testament maybe you think about a current um 
somebody in a position maybe like a president  

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.400
is the seal of irene in the old testament 
they talk about the of the king when that  

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.240
still would be on there they could take those 
papers anywhere they went with that authority  

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.880
to accomplish the mission that the king 
had given them that's exactly what jesus  

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.680
just did he just basically put his seal 
down and said go with my hilary and power  

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.240
but i just kind of want to i want to summarize 
this before we jump in because i think it's easy  

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.880
for us to jump into okay we're going to say 
go make disciples right go make the cycles  

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.320
but really the submarine verse is before you 
go because she's saying before you go fulfill  

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:13.120
your purpose you need to know where the power 
important to go accomplish those things and  

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:20.160
the really this is saying is you need to have a 
relationship with jesus so again coming back to if  

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.080
the second most important day 
in your life is the day that you  

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:32.240
learn why you were born you need to know the 
person who tells you and shows you and gives you  

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:39.280
the greatest way to experience that second purpose 
right of why you were born you need to know him  

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.160
through a personal relationship and that's the 
part we can't miss because i think at times we we  

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.280
go into this life and we're like we're going we're 
doing well we're we're not going with jesus we're  

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.880
not going with all authority we're not going with 
all power in heaven and on earth we're just going  

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.520
with our own power trying to figure out this 
world against seeking everything in between to  

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.000
figure out what our purpose is but god is saying 
no it starts with a personal relationship with me  

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.360
again this power would come from him and so we 
we wouldn't be able to go anywhere without it  

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.160
if we're trying to accomplish again our purpose 
and so today these five people getting baptized  

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.600
here's what it just makes me think about this is 
they're getting baptized and they've begun this  

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.960
relationship with jesus they've begun the process 
of experiencing the reason why they were born and  

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.400
today they're outwardly expressing that through 
baptism publicly right this is where it's saying  

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:34.400
i'm not afraid to be on the team with jesus i'm 
not afraid to go and to live my life sold out  

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:41.200
that's why we do public baptisms why do we do that 
because it is important for us to not just say  

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.360
i'm a believer in jesus privately through a first 
relationship but i don't need to tell anybody else  

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:53.680
that no this is public this is why we do this and 
so we understand just kind of walk even so we're  

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.480
going to jump off into the next little verses 
which i think will just be eye-opening it was  

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:04.400
for even me as a pastor is this why were you born 
number one this personal issue with jesus to be  

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:12.080
a disciple you can't go and make disciples if you 
aren't a disciple number two is what verse 19 says  

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:18.080
is to go make disciples so after these disciples 
heard jesus pulled him into a huddle and said hey  

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:23.840
listen up this is important one of my last tickets 
i'm going to tell you i'm coming near to you

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:32.800
after he says those things he says go go therefore 
make disciples of all nations baptize them in the  

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:39.040
name of the father son of the holy spirit many of 
us okay i would say all of us unless you wanted  

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.880
to stay here are going to leave this facility and 
you're going to go somewhere so we all understand  

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.080
this idea of go we're going to go somewhere 
but it's what we do in the going that matters  

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.080
it's what we do in the going that matters and he 
says therefore this word therefore is always the  

00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:00.000
question why is it therefore and it's all based 
upon everything that jesus had got done living his  

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.320
life for and the last statement of all authority 
therefore since you know all this and you have  

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:13.840
received me giving your life to me now go and 
make disciples go and make disciples where  

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:20.160
that's the question where everywhere when you look 
at the word go it's really translated as you go  

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.280
so i think sometimes it's it's when we think 
about going and making disciples we leave that  

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.720
to the missionaries we leave that who to 
people who are maybe pastor somebody who  

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.600
who travels across the country or maybe somebody 
from oklahoma the movies insane kind of church  

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.960
you're maybe leading that up to us right to 
do this and the answer is jesus is not talking  

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:47.680
to the special people who are qualified to go to 
make disciples he's speaking to followers of jesus  

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.040
he's speaking to every person that has come to 
faith in him and knows why he came and knows what  

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.840
he gave them he's speaking to everybody so we go 
everywhere to make disciples that's what he says  

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.520
go to all nations and it's interesting when 
we think about nations and nations it's two  

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.640
things number one it's places but it's also 
people groups right lots of you think well  

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.600
i'm gonna go to all the nations when we think 
about nations we've got to go outside of the  

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.680
united states just to be able to fulfill 
this no you actually go to every person  

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.480
no matter a background race um economic level 
you name it doesn't matter it's for everyone  

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.000
and so the question is where do you go you already 
are processing this right if you've given your  

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.800
life to christ and he's saying go as you go go 
make the cycles where do you go where did you go  

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:38.560
so i started thinking well we all go to work and 
you don't go to work maybe you stay at home and  

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.960
work and so you still talk to people and maybe 
if you're at home you have kids and so maybe it's  

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.760
your home and so when you think about discipleship 
you can disciple your kids and you can make  

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:53.520
disciples at work well how do i do that i'm 
supposed to be working lunch breaks conversations  

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.040
praying for them meeting with them after right 
there's ways to make disciples at work what about  

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.880
the gym i mean i'm just trying to go get there and 
get my pump on right that's all that matters to me  

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.920
yes but take a little extra time to actually 
have a conversation with the person next to  

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.320
you get to know them well what about the wall 
game my son's out there playing i'm screaming  

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.920
at him because i'm sometimes that guy um yeah 
there's parents to the left and the right of me  

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.120
that i can begin to spark a conversation who's 
your son who's your child how you know how did  

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:28.240
that you guys get whatever it is right you're 
doing this as you go so the greatest we think  

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.760
about making disciples is church right well that's 
if that's true then that means if we go to church  

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.320
one and a half hours a week maybe your church 
service is shorter i don't know one half hours a  

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.920
week yet we have all the other hours of the week 
and we're dedicating only sundays we're missing  

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:51.760
we're missing now is the church a place to make 
sense absolutely and is that only my role no it's  

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.120
not it's actually our world so that means this 
in the conversations you have when you get here  

00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:00.240
on the conversations you have after you get done 
with worship service today you can make disciples  

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.560
that's what as you go you go make disciples that's 
exactly what jesus is telling his disciples so the  

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:12.880
question is then based on this text what is this 
cycle well what is the disciple he says one who  

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:18.080
believes in jesus who expresses his or her faith 
by being baptized and continues to grow in their  

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.680
faith to teach others what they know so a disciple 
is one who makes disciples so the question i ask  

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.760
myself these are questions even as a pastor i'm 
in the middle of preparing a message and i write  

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:34.240
these questions to myself and then i say is this 
true can a disciple or a follower jesus someone  

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.800
who would say i have a relationship with jesus be 
a true disciple if they're not making disciples  

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:46.160
sit on that for a second if somebody who says 
i'm a follower of jesus i believe in what jesus  

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.280
did for me i'm saved then we call themselves 
a disciple because a follower and disciple has  

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.400
the same thing in jesus eyes could you truly 
be a disciple if you're not making disciples  

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:04.800
so here's the thing that i came up with not no 
being not one who is following god's community so  

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.360
at this moment this is the guy 
because i've been in your seat  

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.680
so many times i never want to preach 
a message that makes you defeated  

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.800
like you you can't like okay i must be the worst 
christian in the world worst person in the world  

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:22.080
and not only defeated no i'm here to encourage 
you here's the reason why god doesn't want to  

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.000
defeat you god wants to encourage you sometimes if 
you're sitting here today okay i've given my life  

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.680
to christ but i don't even know what it means 
to disciple someone else i hope today that we  

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:35.040
can find some ways to start that process that's 
what jesus says he says start today don't worry  

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:40.480
about what you didn't do yesterday and what you 
didn't do this morning today he's not sitting here  

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:46.000
judging you on your past he's saying that's 
forgiven start today so if you're hearing what  

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.240
you're saying like okay well if i'm not disciple 
making disciples then i must not be a christian  

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.960
you know what you may be you just may not know 
how to do it how to go about it and again it's  

00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:01.360
as you go everywhere you go you are sharing with 
others with how to know jesus how to follow jesus  

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.440
by the way you live your life by the way you 
speak and why the way you encourage other people

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.040
so then we see right here where he talks about 
baptism he says baptize them right the name the  

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.040
father son of the holy spirit what's the purpose 
of that so i'll talk just a little bit about this  

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.520
but i want to kind of get on this today again 
because we're baptizing is we see in this text  

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:28.240
it's fulfilling the command by jesus jesus said go 
make disciples and baptize them so it's one of the  

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:34.400
greatest commands i mean if jesus is going to say 
go be baptized we should go do that we shouldn't  

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.800
not just do that because we don't want to right 
we should do it because that's what jesus tells us  

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.360
to do so number one is just to philosophy command 
number two it's a public profession of your faith  

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.240
again you're not a classic christian you're 
not one that says i gave my life to christ  

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.280
and i'm not gonna let my life shine that's 
undo it he says let your light shine so  

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:57.840
baptism is one of the first steps to be public 
about your faith number two it identifies you  

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:04.640
with jesus's death that's why you go under water 
right his death burial so you die with christ your  

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:10.240
old self your old way of life and you rise new 
right and so this is the part where sometimes it  

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.680
gets a little bit confusing and this is why i love 
being able to talk a little bit more about this  

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.840
common questions what if i was baptized 
before i gave my life to christ  

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.840
just being completely honest reading god's word if 
you're baptized before you come to faith in christ  

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:30.400
what are you really celebrating and here's 
not to be rude but it's just to say that  

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.480
we're celebrating what christ has done for 
us and so a baptism before salvation is not  

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:41.280
celebrating that now what i do understand and i've 
been enough uh around this is baby existence right  

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.320
and so those are all done with the 
right heart because we actually did a  

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.800
parent and baby dedication a couple weeks ago and 
the whole idea behind that was we're dedicating  

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.120
that child to the lord we're not saving we 
can't it's a personal relationship with jesus  

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.760
but we're dedicated the lord saying this lord 
please help us raise this child to know jesus  

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.680
right and so if you were baptized as an infant 
not after you give your life to christ is it's so  

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.160
important to know that that baptism is just really 
not on the right side of salvation it's just not  

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.960
on the word where jesus commands us so should you 
get back to us again biblically yes you should  

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.920
and that's okay to be baptized as a child and to 
be baptized again after faith in christ it's not  

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.440
a bad thing that's actually a good thing 
because it's following jesus here here's  

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.560
the other one does baptism save you i mean he 
says go baptize people so does baptism save you  

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.760
and what i would would say again from studying 
god's word is no it's faith in jesus he says  

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:37.200
those who confess jesus as lord and savior your 
life will be saved so that means i don't have  

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:42.320
to be baptized well no so baptism again is 
publicly professing your faith and if you  

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.760
don't want to identify with jesus 
are you truly willing to follow jesus  

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.560
and so this is the the other part 
right is well what if somebody can't  

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.360
what if they get a lot to christ and die five 
minutes later are they going to happen absolutely  

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.200
absolutely that that's where we have to 
understand is going back to the cross there was  

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:06.960
two other guys one to his left one to his right 
jesus one says jesus remembering me in paradise  

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.120
basically he proclaimed his faith in jesus and 
jesus said i will see you in paradise well he  

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.800
didn't take him down off the cross go baptize and 
put him back up on the cross and let him die to  

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:20.320
make sure they were saved well then again this 
is where we try to yes i'm just like you i love  

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.680
i make this statement probably way too many 
times i love that two plus two equals four  

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.800
why because it works every time i like systems 
i like to be able to work the process to make  

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:35.360
sure that i get somewhere i used to be that guy if 
i'm just good enough i'll get to heaven god takes  

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.640
all that away and says his grace which means 
that he's given us something we don't deserve  

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.760
and he's not giving us what we 
deserve which is death following  

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:48.720
and so in the the idea of salvation salvation 
comes from jesus alone and what he did on the  

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:55.360
cross and our faith in him and our faith in one 
another nothing else nothing else but baptism is  

00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:02.080
a sign a declaration of your faith and absent from 
it you're denying your public profession of him  

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.040
which really would again between you and the lord 
denies maybe your profession of your faith in him  

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.760
that's not for me to decide that's between you 
and the lord and the conviction on your heart  

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.920
in them so let's look at this last verse because 
this is this is important we're not missing the  

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:23.440
whole picture right why were we born number one 
we learned it was through a personal relationship  

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.640
with jesus right we have to know jesus has 
all authority we have to know him personally  

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.560
right then we we know his sec his second one is 
said go go make disciples where we're supposed to  

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.160
go as we go we're supposed to make disciples 
we're supposed to be a disciple and we're  

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:43.840
supposed to make disciples i love answering 
this question how do we do it i mean guys  

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:49.280
i i know you're a lot like me and if you're not 
i'll stand here and just say i struggle with this  

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.600
there's a lot of things i know i should be 
doing but i just don't know what i'm doing  

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:58.400
and i'm embarrassed to ask i'm embarrassed 
to ask and it's okay to ask questions  

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.760
it's so it's okay to ask questions i don't 
care if you've been safe for 15 years  

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.440
you haven't been making disciples and you're 
saying how do i make disciples it's okay to ask  

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.880
this is this is good to ask questions i remember 
my teacher in in college would say there's no  

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.640
stupid questions except for i asked a question 
i think he called me stupid but that's another  

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:21.920
story but truthfully there aren't when it comes to 
knowing how to follow jesus better but he lays it  

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:27.840
out here how do we make disciples how do we do it 
because i don't know how great he says in verse 20  

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:35.520
he says in teaching them to observe 
everything i command you okay so but  

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.080
i don't know everything that jesus has committed 
us to do great he's given us this word to tell us  

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.240
that's where it starts it starts 
with the personal ship of him  

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.560
and it starts with getting to know 
him through spending time his word  

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:54.000
in community this is why we're here today we have 
a community outside of this called our inspirers  

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.040
on wednesday nights spending time praying for 
encouraging walking through tough life situations  

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:07.520
that's how we learn what he's saying here as teach 
them everything that to observe everything right  

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.640
so that's the only way we're going to notice if we 
actually follow him daily it's milk and daily one  

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.320
of the greatest excuses that we tend to use is 
i don't know enough to tell people about jesus  

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.640
i don't know enough to make disciples and here's 
just an encouragement for you maybe you can just  

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:28.560
take a deep side relief if you know what say how 
jesus saved you how to come to faith in jesus you  

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.960
know enough to disciple somebody else you know 
what you do you just tell them that and if they  

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:38.480
ask you a question you don't know just go i don't 
know but i'm gonna write it down i'm gonna go  

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.880
pray i'm gonna look at the word i'm gonna contact 
my small group leader i'm gonna i'm gonna contact  

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.840
my pastor pastor can you help me i don't answer 
this question i just told him about jesus and i'll  

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.800
say you're making disciples the word says you're 
making disciples if you tell them what you do know  

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.200
and you grow in your knowledge to tell them 
more right all the things he says observe not  

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.760
just tell them he says he says teach them 
to observe or to walk in so discipleship  

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.320
is really just teaching them to walk in it and 
to model it and help them walk in that process  

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.280
so it's so important for us not to neglect 
the word of god it's so important for us  

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.440
to not neglect the gathering of believers to 
ask the tough questions or ask the questions  

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.200
this is a safe place to be like i don't know and 
we can all say hey we're struggling too we're  

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.360
trying to figure it out let's work together and 
figure this out but he says teach them right so  

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:31.120
how do we make disciples we teach them and here's 
the great part number one and he i thought like  

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.720
he look into this right it starts off it says 
authority in heaven and earth is mine right  

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:43.760
all authority has been given to jesus so that 
gives me the confidence to go make disciples  

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.080
feeling a little bit clueless because i know 
that he has the power and authority to help me  

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.720
fulfill that but then he ends this with an 
important statement he says again teaching  

00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:00.000
them to observe everything i'm commanding you 
and remember remember such an important word  

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.200
i am with you always till the end of the age jesus 
is with you every step of the way he's with you  

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:12.080
every step of the way see when we talk 
about as we give our lives to christ it says  

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.000
the bible talks about that jesus lives 
inside of us right and it's that moment that  

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.480
we understand when we're struggling we ask god 
to help us give us the words to say help us know  

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:29.200
what your word says to be able to make disciples 
so we are not alone we are not alone in this so  

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:35.760
just finishing up to today is getting this this 
thought that challenged me last week the two most  

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.240
important days in our life is the day that we're 
born and the day we realized why we're moving  

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.200
i'm telling you guys i wrestled with that so much 
in my adult life and the reason why i grew up in  

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.080
a home that was four we just moved forward and i 
didn't realize probably before until it came out  

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.880
of order right and i remember as a kid and all 
of my siblings and we just said we're never  

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.080
going to be poor we're going to work we're 
going to go to college we're going to make  

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.720
all the money in the world we're going to have 
things guys i i'm telling you i told people i'm  

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.520
never going to fix my my dishwasher i'm not 
going to know my lawn i want all that paper  

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:14.080
i don't want to do anything i know it sounds 
lazy that's just me those were my goals in  

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.920
life because i thought that was going to fulfill 
me and i just found the more that i pursued it  

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:22.320
the less i had the less i had the ability to 
accomplish those things and i realized that  

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:27.360
those things were fleeting i realized those things 
were fleeting so that wasn't my purpose until god  

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.080
got a hold of me and took about a year i spent a 
year in church listening to god's word and going  

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:40.080
i am nothing like this but there's something that 
is drawing me in but i like doing things i like  

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.080
being able to accomplish it on my own i couldn't 
do it i couldn't fulfill my life through what i  

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:49.520
could do so finally i just turned my life to jesus 
and i said please help me and it's been about 11  

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.480
years that god has brought me to this point and 
another state i never thought i'd see myself in  

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.280
to be able to share the holy love of jesus that 
i've experienced life change man god has changed  

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.160
me so much through a personal relationship with 
him every day i ask him how can i make disciples  

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.400
how can i know you can be a disciple and how can 
i make disciples i want to fulfill my purpose  

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:15.920
what's your purpose what's your purpose your 
purpose is to be a disciple follow jesus to know  

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:23.040
jesus as a personal savior savior you need to also 
as you know jesus share that with other people and  

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.000
help make disciples other people who know jesus 
and follow jesus so why is this so important  

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:34.720
because someone else's eternity depends upon 
it so again i'll kind of lay it out this way is  

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.000
if we are in this room and something you 
know jesus and you're not making disciples  

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.880
there's someone waiting on you there's someone 
waiting on the other side of your obedience  

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.320
to come to faith in jesus and you're like 
what but god's sovereignty you're right  

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:57.840
he saved you and if you're not in heaven 
right now you're still here to be used  

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.600
i remember talking to my grandma um 
i lost my grandpa a couple years ago  

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.600
i think it was it was tough 
for us and tough for her and  

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.920
i remember her saying um what's what's my 
purpose what's my man are we talking about  

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.040
what's my purpose what what am i going to do now 
and she doesn't have to take care of everyone

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.160
i said if you're still breathing and you're 
still here today you still have a purpose  

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.920
and i'm beginning to share and you know what 
i've pointed out to you i wonder through the  

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.560
word of god and she started studying the word of 
god and you know she supports us financially here  

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:37.920
to be able to help plant this church and she prays 
for us and you know every time i talk to your mom  

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.400
maybe you're fulfilling your purpose and she she 
stays at home most times again she's been very  

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:47.120
leery of her artists and all these things what's 
my purpose she's just done she's helping us make  

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:53.360
disciples see that that's what we we understand is 
all of us desire to be used by god we wonder why  

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.760
are we still here what god what does god want to 
do with us he wants to change the world from you  

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:06.640
through you wow like you yeah even you if you're 
wondering that right you and me and everyone  

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.520
and i remember hearing this statement um when 
we talk about living for ourselves we're living  

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.640
forward for god c.s lewis said this aim 
at heaven and you'll get earth thrown in  

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.720
aim at earth and you'll give me too many times 
we're living for this world when this world was  

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.080
not our home we were designed to live in 
heaven and a perfect relationship with god  

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:33.200
for eternity so today as we celebrate the five 
people who have given their lives to christ  

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:39.360
and through baptism and celebrating that 
again they're taking their first steps towards  

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:44.880
discovering that purpose and i'm so proud of them 
i'm so excited for them but what about you have  

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:52.080
you experienced that second understanding of why 
you're born can you experience that and if you  

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.320
have it today i just want to extend the offer 
it's nothing that i can do it's only what jesus  

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:01.920
can do is that jesus the son of god loves you 
god loves you so much that he sent his son jesus  

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:08.960
the perfect life that we can't walk he walked 
it for a reason to do a couple of things one to  

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.640
show us how to live and have a relationship with 
god and if you study god's word enough you'll see  

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:20.880
that jesus even spent tons of time away from his 
disciples and a relationship with god but two he  

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.720
walked the life we couldn't walk so that we could 
experience a relationship with god we couldn't  

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.040
have had apartheid so you're wondering today well 
how do i get my life to jesus how do i begin to  

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.040
even explore maybe a next step you're not ready 
to give your life to jesus it's just questions  

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.920
you know one is just to ask those questions for 
me i'm going to be here after service i'd love to  

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.800
talk to you again i'm not here to um i don't force 
things i don't want to be enforcer right that's  

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.840
god god's going to be the one that shares that 
with you but i want to be able to talk with you  

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.920
and answer any questions you have but if you want 
to give your life to jesus it's through faith  

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.760
through faith alone and what he did on the cross 
and then you begin that relationship and so i'm  

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.800
going to be standing back here we're going to 
invitation here just a second let me tell you what  

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:03.040
invitations sport so many times church said these 
invitations and people like they're singing what's  

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.880
the purpose it's for you to just ask god this 
question i don't care where you're at relationship  

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:13.200
god what's my next step am i making disciples and 
if i am please help me know that and affirm that  

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.440
if i'm not making disciples how do i begin making 
cycles maybe it's for you it's that next step  

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.680
towards jesus and you need to give your life to 
jesus so i'm going to stay in the back today as as  

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.160
