00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.330
Maybe there's a chance I get you outta
here before the rain starts pouring down.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.390
You guys can be a little
bit drier, maybe not.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.970
I'm not promising that,
not promising that.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.060
Um, so we are continuing our
series, um, over next steps.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.470
Um, and so, uh, you guys can go
ahead and turn to Matthew chapter 20.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.470
We're gonna be covering
verses 24 through 28.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.990
We're gonna be covering
also John chapter 13.

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:31.455
Um, I'm not gonna preach through
every aspect of it, but it's, it's

00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:34.905
two texts that really speak to
what we're talking about today.

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:38.985
So Matthew 20 versus 24 through 20
eights, what our main text of what

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:40.355
we'll be walking through today.

00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:43.965
Um, and as we've been talking about,
uh, the last couple weeks, if you've

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:47.685
missed any of the messages over
the last two weeks, either through

00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:53.265
serving or just not able to be
here, um, go back and watch online.

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:56.475
It's important for us all to be on
the same page, to be able to hear

00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:58.065
everything that we've been talking about.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.770
So we've been talking about the last
two weeks following Jesus and why we

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.099
make that a priority in our church and
why that's the first thing we make a

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:09.360
priority because everything we do flows
out of that relationship with Jesus.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.260
Then last week we talked about living
in community and how that community

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.390
is so important for us to develop
and to grow our faith in Christ.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.210
And when we even think about
living in community, how

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.585
important it is, For one another.

00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:23.795
Right?

00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:27.665
A lot of times we think of community as
what do I get out of it, but many times

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:29.585
community is how you can give back.

00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:30.765
To someone.

00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:32.595
And so we've talked about
those two things, right?

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:36.615
And we really believe that as we continue
through, uh, talking about our strategy

00:01:36.615 --> 00:01:38.025
of fulfilling our mission, right?

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:42.015
Our mission is to inspire hope by helping
people discover God's purpose for their

00:01:42.015 --> 00:01:43.425
life, through a relationship with Jesus.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:46.665
We really believe that as we talk
through the strategy, as we begin to.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.780
Live out this strategy that God has
given us to follow Jesus, live in

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.259
community, serve those around us
and expand God's kingdom, that we

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.020
will be able to fulfill that mission
that God has given us as a church.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.990
Um, and, and one of the things I
think that's so interesting with

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.869
this is, um, I I'm really good.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.520
I used to, uh, in college, I was
really good at listening to the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.359
professor and going like that's
great information, but you know what?

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.310
One of the things that typically
was the hardest thing for.

00:02:13.935 --> 00:02:17.295
Was when I walked out the door, it was
almost as though I forgot everything.

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:21.765
So that's so important for us that we
are walking out the door with something.

00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:25.155
And so that's my hope each week is
that you're able to take something

00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:29.024
to think through how I can take
a next step in my faith with

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:31.304
Christ in these different areas.

00:02:31.635 --> 00:02:35.475
Um, and so, um, one of the things I wanna
share with you guys, just a couple of

00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:36.614
things we've beginning to think through.

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:37.545
I actually asked a couple of.

00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:42.615
Uh, members this question, I
said, how have we really fulfilled

00:02:42.615 --> 00:02:44.895
our mission using our strategy?

00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:48.165
And I wanted to kind of talk through
a couple of the wins over the last,

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:50.025
um, year, year and a half for us.

00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:53.805
And here's the reason why, if
you don't celebrate the wins.

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:59.325
You'll get defeated because a lot of times
we're always looking for the next thing.

00:02:59.475 --> 00:03:01.515
And so some of the wins that
we've had in fallen Jesus, I

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:02.535
was, I was counting this up.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.735
I think it's somewhere between 11 and 12
people between kids and adults have given

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:08.595
their lives to Christ since being here.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:11.745
Um, since inspiring hope has
started, we've seen, uh, several of

00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:14.445
them fall through baptism and some
kids that are actually considering

00:03:14.445 --> 00:03:16.275
falling through baptism soon.

00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:18.375
Um, we've been talking
about living in community.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.380
One of the cool parts of that is our
community started in an inspire group.

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.649
Um, and last year we started a second
inspire group and then this year

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:26.820
we're starting a third inspire group.

00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:28.950
So if we look at living in
community, we've expanded that

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.200
community and living together.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.130
Um, and something that we're gonna talk
about today is serving those around us.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.730
Cuz I could give you a laundry list of
ways in which we've served our community.

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:43.225
And serve those around us, um, through
our schools, through outreach events,

00:03:43.225 --> 00:03:45.895
through our mission teams coming
in through vacation Bible school,

00:03:45.895 --> 00:03:49.735
port sports camps, um, Christmas
presents for kids, you name it.

00:03:49.735 --> 00:03:52.975
We have done so much as a church and
I list just a couple of these, because

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.785
again, I could probably go on and on
and on about all the wins, all the ways

00:03:56.785 --> 00:04:00.145
in which as a church we've, we've taken
next steps to follow Jesus as we've

00:04:00.145 --> 00:04:03.805
taken next steps to live in community
as we've taken next steps, as we'll talk

00:04:03.805 --> 00:04:05.395
about today to serve those around us.

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:08.215
But here's the thing we're not done.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.020
That's one of the things that I am
encouraged by is that we can look

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.829
and celebrate all that God has done,
but God has not done with you yet.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.380
And it, most of you may not
know how to take a pulse.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.170
So if you take a pulse here or here,
if you will take a pulse, you'll

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.400
start feeling your heart beating.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.690
If your heart is beating, that
means God is not done with you yet.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.880
And I think this way, as a church,
collectively, our hearts are beating

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.930
together and as our hearts are
beating together, we're not done.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.110
We still have more that got
us called us to fulfill.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.730
And I'm excited about that.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.710
I don't know about you guys,
but I wanna be a part of that.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.260
I believe many of you are here
today because you're saying

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.280
you wanna be a part of that.

00:04:47.285 --> 00:04:47.670
Right?

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.450
So what's it gonna take, it's
gonna take sacrifice of our time,

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.780
talents and treasures to fulfill
the mission that God us called us.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.460
And so here's the question.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.070
Why as a church, would we do this?

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.410
Why do we want to continue to see.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.620
God move in our lives,
in our church's life.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.560
And if we talk about specifically
today, why do we want to focus

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.970
on serving those around us?

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.700
Because that's exactly what Jesus did.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.720
Jesus has changed our life and we
look to Jesus to model our life

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.760
after and specifically in the area of
serving Jesus ultimately served us by

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.070
coming and dying for us in our place.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.700
Right.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.730
To give us a new life, a new S.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.830
To give us freedom from our sins and
to give us a hope and a peace and a

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.690
community of people to do life with.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.960
Those are things that I think through
all that God has given me, as I

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.500
begin to look at Christ's life,
I wanna follow after his life.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.340
So let's talk specifically
about service or serving.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.770
Whenever I think about serving,
I tend to always think about,

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.900
um, a waitress or a waiter.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.080
So who here likes to go to a restaurant
and have a waitress or waiter serve them?

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.350
Well, I mean like you, you
guys may not be like me.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.700
I'm sitting here thinking in my mind.

00:05:57.295 --> 00:05:59.415
Your tip depends on how well you do now.

00:05:59.415 --> 00:06:00.765
Some of you are just so generous.

00:06:00.765 --> 00:06:02.475
You don't care if they do a
good job, you're gonna tip 'em.

00:06:02.475 --> 00:06:06.885
Well, I tip 'em as well guys, but
I love a good service, not the one

00:06:06.885 --> 00:06:09.465
where they're, they're checking
on me every like three seconds.

00:06:09.645 --> 00:06:12.795
But the one, it seems like they're
always just at there at the right time.

00:06:13.815 --> 00:06:16.305
And, and, you know, you may
not experience that often.

00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:16.635
Right.

00:06:16.845 --> 00:06:18.765
But I enjoy whenever people serve me.

00:06:18.765 --> 00:06:21.225
Well, let, let me give you
a another great example.

00:06:22.065 --> 00:06:24.495
I loved, I mean, my, my wife's
such a good job at this.

00:06:24.495 --> 00:06:25.605
My kids are such a good job at this.

00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:26.895
They care take care of the home.

00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:30.885
Like nowadays the age of my kids, like I
don't do much around the house anymore.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.555
Used to, I was doing all these
things, but the kids do dishes and

00:06:33.555 --> 00:06:36.195
laundry and Brittany takes care of
the kids and does all these things.

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:39.165
And I enjoy coming home
and not having to do much.

00:06:39.555 --> 00:06:39.765
Right.

00:06:39.765 --> 00:06:41.505
I enjoy being served well.

00:06:42.405 --> 00:06:47.355
But let let's think about this
when it now is my turn at times.

00:06:47.355 --> 00:06:49.185
Let let's just say this,
cuz it's happened before.

00:06:49.185 --> 00:06:51.405
Well, Britney gets busy and
I've gotta take on some of

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.365
the responsibilities at home.

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:54.285
I kind of think it stinks.

00:06:54.825 --> 00:06:56.625
I don't like folded laundry.

00:06:57.045 --> 00:07:01.065
I don't wanna cook dinner and I, I, I
think it stinks because you know what

00:07:01.065 --> 00:07:02.805
it's it's on me, but I like being served.

00:07:03.225 --> 00:07:05.955
I mean, you guys like being served, but
at times whenever you are in someone

00:07:05.955 --> 00:07:08.835
else's shoes, eh, you're okay with it.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.140
Maybe not.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.500
I also think about this a lot of times
when we put ourselves in someone else's

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.810
shoes, we begin to appreciate them
more and more guys, when we serve those

00:07:18.815 --> 00:07:24.240
around us, we're putting ourselves in
Jesus' feet and we begin to realize

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:30.270
the sacrifice and effort it takes
to serve someone, especially someone

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.920
who's hard and difficult to serve.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.540
Maybe even your enemies.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.680
It is hard to do.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.060
And you begin to realize
this is what Jesus.

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:40.349
And so, I don't know, I just started
thinking through a couple of ways that

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:44.070
we tend to be served and, and how I,
at times do not like to be served.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.469
And I wanna give you a great
practical example for me.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.680
So I always go to things in my
life that I'm doing consistently.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.979
And so as I coach CrossFit, we've
started doing a nine 15 class.

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:55.620
I used to coach a noon class
and I do a 9:15 AM class.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.370
And it tends to be this class
of moms with lots of kids.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.000
See if I wanted to be around
a ton of kids, I'd go home.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.880
And so at the gym it's been difficult
cuz it's like all these kids

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.080
running around and I'm going, man.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.310
And again, I'm being selfish.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.280
Like man, it's a little noisy in
here and all of a sudden, the Lord

00:08:10.285 --> 00:08:14.090
convicted me and he goes, you know,
these moms are here because they're

00:08:14.095 --> 00:08:17.660
trying to do something for themselves
and I've changed my perspective.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.300
And so last week, this
is what I've turned into.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.480
Now I'm a coach slash like
childcare professional.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:29.330
I'm pushing a kid in a stroller
while yelling at the mom go.

00:08:30.255 --> 00:08:32.625
Lift faster, go faster.

00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:35.715
And you don't wanna know what the
coolest part in that same experience

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:40.095
while serving as a coach and as a
part-time, whatever you wanna call

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.545
me, child caretaker, the kid falls
asleep while I'm pushing him around.

00:08:43.605 --> 00:08:45.525
And the mom, you can see it.

00:08:45.795 --> 00:08:48.975
That's the first break she's had of
her three kids in the last three days.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.065
She's like, oh my gosh,
like, thank you so much.

00:08:52.185 --> 00:08:56.655
I actually got to work out without having
chase after my kid or push my kid around.

00:08:57.375 --> 00:09:00.825
And in that moment, I felt
this sense of fulfillment.

00:09:01.185 --> 00:09:03.885
See, we don't serve because it's easy.

00:09:03.885 --> 00:09:09.405
We serve because we see the value and
the opportunity of building back into

00:09:09.405 --> 00:09:14.295
someone's life and see Jesus served
us because here's the, the point Jesus

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:19.365
served us so well that when he served,
he saw the life change in our lives and

00:09:19.365 --> 00:09:21.555
you go, wait, Jesus lived 2000 years ago.

00:09:21.765 --> 00:09:22.575
What do you mean?

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:24.465
Jesus could see.

00:09:24.945 --> 00:09:27.645
Everything his, his
perspective was not limited.

00:09:27.825 --> 00:09:33.075
And so when he served by coming right,
and he began to give up his life

00:09:33.075 --> 00:09:34.725
and live the life we couldn't live.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.935
And the way in which he served
his disciples, man, he did that

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.895
because he knew the investment
he was making in each one of us.

00:09:42.195 --> 00:09:43.965
See, that motivates me.

00:09:44.325 --> 00:09:45.675
That encourages me.

00:09:46.305 --> 00:09:49.695
So at times whenever I wanna be
selfish at times when I want to not.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.910
That I choose to serve because
it allows me to show the love

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.620
of Jesus to those around us.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.660
So why as Christ followers, is it
important for us to serve those around us?

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.750
Because we want other people to
experience the love, the hope, the,

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:11.760
the compassion of Jesus that maybe
other people aren't experiencing.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.850
And I started thinking through
this guys, we are the physical

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:20.640
representation of Christ to those
around us, with God has chose to use

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.090
each one of us to fulfill his mission.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.050
And when we recognize that
we are the centerpiece of

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.360
serving everybody around us.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.710
So that's what Jesus did
when he was on earth.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.590
But when he left, he let that
responsibility with us guys.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.530
Now he's given us the ability
to be the physical presence of

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.070
Christ in people's life and how
it looks to serve those around.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.939
And I love using these experiences,
but I want you to think about this.

00:10:44.939 --> 00:10:49.170
There is someone around you today,
tomorrow that's waiting on you

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.699
to serve them well so that they
can experience who Jesus is.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.800
So you're wondering, okay, when
are we gonna get in the text?

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.660
We're jumping into the text
now, but I wanna set this up.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.870
Matthew 20 versus 24 through 28.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.370
What happened before then?

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.670
Jesus just got done telling his
disciples for the third time.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.160
Hey, I'm getting ready to die.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.620
I'm getting ready to go
to the cross and die.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.750
And it's so interesting.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.740
What happens next?

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.390
As soon as he gets ready to tell, or he
tells his disciples, this statement, two

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:23.220
of the disciples mother, which it's John
and James, they, she comes to Jesus.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:23.970
And this is what she says.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:24.660
I'm gonna read this.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:29.130
It's not up on the screen, but it says
here, um, in verse 20, it says then

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.440
the mother of Zeb sons approach him.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.440
Speaking of Jesus, this is right after
he just said, Hey, I'm getting ready to

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.570
die on the cross and be raised again.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.700
She nailed down and asked for something.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.350
He says, what do you want?

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.250
Here's the cool part.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.490
Jesus literally just lays out his
heart about what he's gonna do.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.360
And somebody has a need and wants
asked a question and he doesn't

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.220
just like, say, no, I'm too busy.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.270
I'm getting ready to go die for you.

00:11:51.275 --> 00:11:52.560
He says, no, what's your question.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.250
And so this is why she
says, um, she says promise.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:00.240
She said to him that these two sons
of mine may sit at one at your right

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.880
and one at your left in your kingdom.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.200
And Jesus answered.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.850
You don't know what you're asking.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.860
Are you able to drink the
cup that I'm about to.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.390
The two boys or the two, not boys,
but the two men said we are able,

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.290
they said to him, and so he told
them, you will indeed drink my cup,

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.570
but to sit at my right into my left.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.100
Uh, to give is instead is not,
oh, I'm gonna say this better.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.120
You will indeed drink my cup, but to
sit at my right and left is not mine

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.170
to give instead, it is those for whom
and has been prepared for by my father.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:35.190
So we see these two brothers
wanting to sit at the right and

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.140
the left of Jesus and his kingdom.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:43.620
They are more worried about themselves and
their position than they are about what

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.300
Jesus was getting ready to go do to them.

00:12:46.305 --> 00:12:47.595
This is where we pick up on the story.

00:12:47.595 --> 00:12:49.275
So this is the part you'll
see up on the screen.

00:12:49.545 --> 00:12:52.695
So in verses 24, and on, we're
gonna read here, it says when the 10

00:12:52.695 --> 00:12:54.675
disciples, cuz there was 12 of 'em.

00:12:54.675 --> 00:13:00.615
So the other 10 heard this, they became
indignant with the two brothers and

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.825
Jesus called them over and said, you
know that the rulers of the Gentiles

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:07.515
lorded over them and those in high
positions act as Tyran over them.

00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:11.595
It must not be like this
among you on the contrary.

00:13:11.655 --> 00:13:14.535
Whoever wants to be great
among you must be your.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.320
whoever wants to be first
among you must be your slave.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.070
Just that the son of man did not come
to be served, but to serve and to

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.410
give his life as a ransom for many.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.750
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.630
We pray Lord that our hearts
are open a Lord to your word.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.800
I pray that each one of us leaves outta
here challenged and changed Lord in the

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.210
area of serving those around us Lord,
because you modeled what that looks like,

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.740
and you've challenged us to continue that
on today, uh, with everyone around us.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.150
And so we just pray this
in your heavily name.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:45.900
Amen.

00:13:46.695 --> 00:13:49.575
So the first thing we see
here is, uh, something that

00:13:49.575 --> 00:13:51.045
I think we can all relate to.

00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:55.695
The reason why we typically struggle
to serve those around us is the

00:13:55.695 --> 00:14:00.645
same reason why the disciples
struggled, selfishness, selfishness.

00:14:01.319 --> 00:14:04.410
You, if you look at this text, you
might actually see the disciples.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.530
It says that they, they become
indignant over the two brothers.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.000
Basically they become angry.

00:14:09.209 --> 00:14:13.170
You may think they're becoming righteously
angry because they're, they're angry

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.530
because the two guys even wanted to sit
at the side of Jesus and that they would

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.459
even ask them that after what Jesus said,
we wanna assume that they they're just

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:23.640
trying to be good Christians and really
get on the two brothers for asking that.

00:14:25.095 --> 00:14:28.305
But Jesus knew more than that because
he wasn't just addressing the two when

00:14:28.305 --> 00:14:31.275
he goes on, he's actually addressing
the 12 people's hearts because

00:14:31.275 --> 00:14:34.335
these men were frustrated that they
didn't get the chance to ask first.

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:37.995
You may say, well, how do you know that
it doesn't exactly say that in the text.

00:14:38.175 --> 00:14:40.305
What we do know is we begin to
look at the disciples every time

00:14:40.305 --> 00:14:43.785
that they spent with Jesus, they
tend to always ask this question.

00:14:43.845 --> 00:14:45.825
Who's gonna be the greatest
in the kingdom of God.

00:14:46.515 --> 00:14:48.755
They, they always wanted the
best positions at the table.

00:14:49.605 --> 00:14:53.175
They wanted to, to be in, they
wanted, they weren't worried about

00:14:53.175 --> 00:14:55.005
themselves in their position.

00:14:55.455 --> 00:14:57.525
And so we see that there for them.

00:14:57.525 --> 00:15:00.045
And as you guys even heard me talk
about when it comes to serving,

00:15:00.405 --> 00:15:04.605
typically I, I want, I wanna be served
well, I, I, I, I care about if I'm

00:15:04.605 --> 00:15:08.025
sitting up front or if I'm in the most
comfortable chair, do I get the best

00:15:08.055 --> 00:15:09.225
meal or do I get the best service?

00:15:09.345 --> 00:15:11.355
It tends to be more about me.

00:15:11.355 --> 00:15:15.165
And so when I look at this, I
see myself in the disciples feet.

00:15:16.035 --> 00:15:16.845
Going man.

00:15:17.445 --> 00:15:18.525
Why did they ask first?

00:15:18.525 --> 00:15:21.375
I, I should have been there and
you know, I'm a little bit jealous.

00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:26.265
And so anybody here ever been jealous
over somebody's position or relationship

00:15:26.265 --> 00:15:29.295
or income status or social media status?

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:32.295
I mean, I can't tweet like some people,
I don't even know if Twitter's out

00:15:32.295 --> 00:15:36.945
there anymore, but some of us think
that we're, we're better than ourselves.

00:15:37.245 --> 00:15:42.135
And I started thinking about this,
these disciples when Jesus exonerated

00:15:42.135 --> 00:15:44.655
die is more worried about themselves.

00:15:45.465 --> 00:15:49.365
They're thinking inwardly about where's my
position gonna be in the kingdom of God.

00:15:50.025 --> 00:15:53.235
And they weren't even thinking outside of
themselves about where's everybody else's

00:15:53.235 --> 00:15:54.735
position gonna be in the kingdom of God.

00:15:55.545 --> 00:16:02.324
See, I, I started thinking as Christians
today, at times we catch ourselves just

00:16:02.324 --> 00:16:07.045
like the disciples where we think we are
better than those who don't know Christ.

00:16:07.145 --> 00:16:10.125
Now, now I wanna actually
lay this out in some forms.

00:16:10.305 --> 00:16:11.865
We're in a better position.

00:16:12.435 --> 00:16:14.595
Meaning that we have a relationship
with Christ that we're, we're gonna

00:16:14.595 --> 00:16:19.125
spend an eternity in heaven, but we
are not better in terms of our lives.

00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:20.775
We are all sinners.

00:16:21.975 --> 00:16:22.965
We're all sinners.

00:16:23.175 --> 00:16:26.595
We're all in need of
God's grace and mercy.

00:16:26.895 --> 00:16:30.165
But at times I know this whenever
I was lost, whenever I didn't

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.665
know Christ, I struggled with
Christians who seemed to have.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:39.780
this air about them, that they were better
than me, that they knew more than me.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.360
And they wanted to show me that.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.050
And that just turned me totally off
because if that's what a Christ follower's

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.000
gonna be, I don't wanna be a part of this.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.970
And I I'm looking at this with these
guys and I'm kind of struggling with the

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.329
same thing and going man, if, if they
all they care about is their position.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.220
And then I started looking at myself.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:02.189
If all I care about is how well I'm
served, then I need to check my heart.

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:06.075
So again, the reason why we don't
like serving those around us is

00:17:06.075 --> 00:17:08.145
because it's typically selfishness.

00:17:08.415 --> 00:17:11.595
We're, how's this gonna affect
me more than how's it going

00:17:11.595 --> 00:17:13.155
to benefit someone else?

00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:16.815
Well, let, let's continue to see this,
that Jesus confronts his disciples

00:17:17.655 --> 00:17:20.595
in the way in which we, we would
perceive that they are more concerned

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.985
about themselves than anyone else.

00:17:23.185 --> 00:17:26.204
And so he says this, he says, you
know, that the rulers of the Gentiles

00:17:26.204 --> 00:17:30.015
lorded over them and those in high
positions act as tyrants over.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.500
And he says, it must not
be like this among you.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.000
So let's just start there.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.570
Basically what Jesus is telling us
disciples is those who don't know

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:46.200
Christ, they're acting basically that
they are more important in this world.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.880
Than than anybody else.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.740
And so we think about
leaders, we think about Kings.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.760
They're more important.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.540
It's all about them.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.980
It's about how they get served.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.630
That's what the world does.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.900
That's what, that's what the,
the, the world wants you to do is

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.610
they, they want to have position.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:00.450
They wanna have stature.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.920
They wanna receive specialist treatment.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:08.010
It's all about them, but Jesus says
it must not be like this among you.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.330
Among you.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.320
So as we think about this, Jesus is
saying if we want, and if he goes

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.560
on or he says that this, this, it
must not be like this among you.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.390
And he says on the contrary, whoever
wants to become great among you.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:24.900
You must be a servant.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.310
So if you don't hear that second
part, I mean, anybody like

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.390
me, do you wanna become great?

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:31.110
Yes.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.540
Do you wanna become great now, some of
you are just humble and you're like,

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.360
no, I just wanna be the worst, you
know, Christ fall or ever, because

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.400
I wanna be humble, but like I, okay.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:39.450
Overal wants to be great.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:39.720
Good.

00:18:39.725 --> 00:18:40.770
Somebody else is with me.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.160
Okay.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.750
We typically wanna be great.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.810
And we're gonna see here in a moment,
we typically wanna be first, like.

00:18:46.379 --> 00:18:50.310
I mean, you guys ever seen kids
like waiting around and all of a

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.750
sudden they say, okay, food's ready.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.219
And like, they run to
the front of the line.

00:18:53.219 --> 00:18:53.490
Why?

00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:56.490
Because they want the
best they wanna be first.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.030
Right.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.139
They wanna be great.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:02.070
And I would say this deep down
inside all of us wanna be great.

00:19:02.669 --> 00:19:03.780
We wanna be great at what we do.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.189
We wanna be great as a Christ follower.

00:19:05.189 --> 00:19:07.080
We wanna be great in, in these things.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:12.320
And he says this, if we wanna be
great, then we are to become a servant.

00:19:13.335 --> 00:19:15.735
I begin to look at this UK Jers out there.

00:19:15.735 --> 00:19:17.115
I started looking at
different translation.

00:19:17.235 --> 00:19:18.105
Here's what it says.

00:19:18.105 --> 00:19:20.925
Another translation is that
you must become a minister.

00:19:21.945 --> 00:19:23.295
You must become a minister.

00:19:24.735 --> 00:19:27.735
So to become a minister is to,
to minister to one another.

00:19:27.735 --> 00:19:28.005
Right?

00:19:28.005 --> 00:19:32.355
And really the translation with this
is one who executes the commands

00:19:32.355 --> 00:19:34.995
of another, the servant of a king.

00:19:35.055 --> 00:19:39.885
Or if we go back to a waiter or a waitress
to serve someone's needs above our own.

00:19:39.885 --> 00:19:41.355
So if we wanna become great.

00:19:42.435 --> 00:19:47.175
as a church, as a group of people,
then we will begin to place

00:19:47.735 --> 00:19:49.365
everyone else's needs above our own.

00:19:49.905 --> 00:19:51.405
See, that's a challenging statement.

00:19:51.405 --> 00:19:55.185
As I begin to reflect and ask
this question as a church, are

00:19:55.185 --> 00:19:56.895
we committing to serve others?

00:19:56.955 --> 00:19:59.355
Are we committing to place
their needs above our own?

00:20:01.274 --> 00:20:02.024
I would say.

00:20:02.775 --> 00:20:03.615
At times we do.

00:20:03.615 --> 00:20:04.335
Absolutely.

00:20:04.605 --> 00:20:06.375
But as individuals, we're
not with each other.

00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:06.795
Right?

00:20:07.245 --> 00:20:10.395
So as we begin to reflect on our
lives, are we in our everyday life?

00:20:10.425 --> 00:20:10.605
Right?

00:20:10.605 --> 00:20:12.885
As a collective group, as
a church, maybe we are.

00:20:13.095 --> 00:20:17.565
But as our everyday life are, we placing
other people's needs above our own.

00:20:17.625 --> 00:20:21.255
Well, he says, if we wanna become
great, then that's what we should do.

00:20:22.755 --> 00:20:25.425
And then he goes on in verse 27 and
he says, and whoever wants to be

00:20:25.425 --> 00:20:28.095
first among you must become a slave.

00:20:28.815 --> 00:20:29.055
Right.

00:20:29.055 --> 00:20:32.774
And to be a slave is to disregard
of one's own interests in

00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:34.395
the sake of another person's.

00:20:36.585 --> 00:20:39.045
So if you ever wanna know if you've
ever been around me whenever there's

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.774
food, I typically eat last because
I wanna be first cuz it says those

00:20:41.774 --> 00:20:44.595
who are first will be last and
those will be last to be first.

00:20:44.595 --> 00:20:44.925
Right.

00:20:45.465 --> 00:20:48.405
So I've just lost my whole reward because
that's my whole intention behind it.

00:20:48.405 --> 00:20:49.754
Cuz I'm trying to be self-serving in that.

00:20:49.905 --> 00:20:52.185
See that's the craziest part
about the Christian walk

00:20:52.425 --> 00:20:53.595
you ever find yourself want.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.629
To like be last because you're
really trying to like honor the

00:20:57.629 --> 00:21:00.870
Lord, but then in there's some
sort of like ego in it to be last.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:05.129
You're like, uh, maybe you're not like
me, but that's how I I'm telling you.

00:21:05.429 --> 00:21:06.000
I do that.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.189
And then there's conviction and I'm
like, should I eat in the middle

00:21:08.189 --> 00:21:09.659
just to kind of throw it off?

00:21:09.689 --> 00:21:10.740
Like, I don't know.

00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:13.560
I don't think that's where
God's getting at guys.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.219
I really don't.

00:21:14.219 --> 00:21:16.620
I think what he's trying to say here is.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.570
The way in which we serve.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:23.220
I, I wanna get to more of this later,
the way in which we serve is a reflection

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.820
of who Jesus is and how Jesus served.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.240
And on the way out, Jesus served us.

00:21:30.245 --> 00:21:34.830
Well, there wasn't anything he
withheld to serve our needs.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.620
Our greatest needs to
be forgiven of our sins.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.500
So when we look at this, Jesus
seems to flip the script when it

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.930
comes to what the world tells us.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.740
I'll just tell you this.

00:21:45.945 --> 00:21:47.205
Before I gave my life to Christ.

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:52.935
You don't wanna know some of the most
aspiring goals I had was to get rich, have

00:21:52.935 --> 00:21:55.605
lots of things and do lots of fun stuff.

00:21:55.935 --> 00:21:58.155
And I didn't really care what it took.

00:21:58.605 --> 00:21:59.595
It was all about me.

00:22:00.855 --> 00:22:05.085
It was all about me, but Jesus is, is
consistently telling us after we come to

00:22:05.085 --> 00:22:10.335
Christ that it's, it's, it's not all about
me because Jesus made it all about us.

00:22:10.365 --> 00:22:13.035
And when he made it all about us
and I received the greatest thing,

00:22:13.035 --> 00:22:17.895
the gift of salvation that now it
is about everyone else's needs.

00:22:18.105 --> 00:22:21.615
See that that's the craziest
part is that we've received.

00:22:21.615 --> 00:22:23.505
If you've given your left card,
you've received the greatest

00:22:23.505 --> 00:22:24.915
gift you can ever receive.

00:22:25.365 --> 00:22:25.995
And that's enough.

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:33.419
But what about those that haven't received
that see, because they're waiting for

00:22:33.419 --> 00:22:39.240
someone to tell them, to show them by
serving them well, and like, that should

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.560
be an aspiring goal for us as individuals
to go out and serve in such a way that

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.480
it points people to Christ and they go,
why are you placing my needs above yours?

00:22:49.199 --> 00:22:52.770
And you can go because Jesus
placed his needs above mine.

00:22:52.774 --> 00:22:53.310
First.

00:22:54.659 --> 00:22:55.370
See that.

00:22:56.925 --> 00:23:01.485
Is why we are motivated to live
the life that we live and to,

00:23:01.605 --> 00:23:04.965
to be a part of a church that
tries to prioritize those things.

00:23:06.705 --> 00:23:10.274
I started thinking through this when
it comes to being generous, right?

00:23:10.274 --> 00:23:13.785
Because again, when we think about
generosity as the opposite of greed,

00:23:14.024 --> 00:23:16.725
right, when it comes to being generous,
we tend to only think about the

00:23:16.725 --> 00:23:19.965
negative aspect of being generous.

00:23:20.115 --> 00:23:20.805
What if I don't have.

00:23:22.574 --> 00:23:25.365
What if I don't have it, what if the
money I give away or the time I give

00:23:25.365 --> 00:23:26.895
away or the resources I give away?

00:23:27.105 --> 00:23:29.504
What if I don't have enough?

00:23:30.435 --> 00:23:33.645
Let me just tell you right
now, you'll never have enough.

00:23:34.485 --> 00:23:36.105
I I've, I've learned this.

00:23:36.105 --> 00:23:38.264
I've I've been married
now, way too many years.

00:23:38.264 --> 00:23:38.475
What?

00:23:38.475 --> 00:23:41.774
17, 18, too many, too many to count.

00:23:42.465 --> 00:23:46.274
It's not what I meant too many to
count my point in that I remember

00:23:46.274 --> 00:23:50.235
thinking when we first got married,
if I could just get this promotion.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:55.800
If I could just get this race, if I could
just get this house, we would have enough.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.530
If we'd just stop, having
kids we'd have enough.

00:23:58.535 --> 00:23:58.830
Right.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.540
All those things.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.160
And here was the truth of it.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:08.130
I have as much as I need, because
that's what God has given me.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.010
So when we think about being
generous, so, you know, this is time

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:13.320
when I thinking about time talents
and treasures of serving people.

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:15.990
Generosity is a part of that
when it comes to being generous,

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.910
you know that to be generous.

00:24:18.544 --> 00:24:20.175
It takes just generosity.

00:24:20.355 --> 00:24:21.225
It doesn't take money.

00:24:22.455 --> 00:24:24.885
It doesn't take all this extra time
that you just have sitting there

00:24:24.885 --> 00:24:27.044
that you wanna give away, or all
this extra money is just sitting

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.635
in the savings account to dig away.

00:24:28.754 --> 00:24:32.115
Do you know, to be generous is,
is just an act of being generous.

00:24:32.415 --> 00:24:37.064
It, it's literally just giving of
what you have to those around you.

00:24:38.715 --> 00:24:42.435
Maybe that seems too simple to
you, but I'm challenged with this

00:24:42.435 --> 00:24:46.064
idea of our time, talents and
treasures to serve those around.

00:24:46.935 --> 00:24:48.375
It's usually it's not money.

00:24:48.375 --> 00:24:49.215
That's holding this back.

00:24:49.215 --> 00:24:51.225
It's not extra time holding this back.

00:24:51.495 --> 00:24:57.645
It's us choosing other things as
more important than those things,

00:24:58.725 --> 00:25:00.195
more important than those things.

00:25:00.495 --> 00:25:01.155
I'll just tell you this.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.245
We all have the same amount of time
and we all can choose how we use it.

00:25:05.755 --> 00:25:10.575
And just so you know, at times I choose
selfish things over things that would

00:25:10.995 --> 00:25:12.765
be, be more beneficial for others.

00:25:14.865 --> 00:25:16.275
Because I like serving myself.

00:25:17.055 --> 00:25:17.475
Why?

00:25:18.165 --> 00:25:20.565
Because that's, our
nature is a sinful nature.

00:25:20.835 --> 00:25:24.375
When I look at God's word, I'm reminded
that God has given me time, talents

00:25:24.375 --> 00:25:27.045
and treasures to serve those around us.

00:25:27.945 --> 00:25:31.965
This is tough, but I, I just go back
and read over these statements if we

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.825
wanna be great, if we wanna be first.

00:25:34.035 --> 00:25:36.345
And, and just so you know,
that's not a bad thing.

00:25:36.345 --> 00:25:40.395
If we wanna be great in God's kingdom
to serve the greatest needs, if we wanna

00:25:40.395 --> 00:25:42.585
be first, which means if we want to be.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.890
From a standpoint of what God
would call a godly person, someone

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:48.090
that is after God's own heart.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:55.170
If we wanna be that we have to stop
having excuses, why we don't have enough

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:59.040
to give we all do no matter what it is.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.610
I reminded myself of this
and it it's challenged me.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:08.520
Um, is this idea behind if
there's more on your list to do

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.460
than once you have time to do.

00:26:10.935 --> 00:26:13.095
There's something on your list
that God didn't put there.

00:26:14.645 --> 00:26:18.284
I, I, I probably realize this and
you guys have the same conversation.

00:26:18.284 --> 00:26:19.455
Usually you'll ask this question.

00:26:19.665 --> 00:26:20.895
How was your week, Joe?

00:26:20.895 --> 00:26:22.725
We had this conversation,
Joe, how was your week?

00:26:22.725 --> 00:26:25.425
He says, if it was busy, you know, if
Joe would've asked me the same question,

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.685
I would've said, man, it was busy.

00:26:27.615 --> 00:26:28.774
We all have busy weeks.

00:26:29.805 --> 00:26:34.305
We all have busy weeks, but when we
look at our life and when we evaluate.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.910
is, are we busy about doing the
Lord's work that he's called us

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.130
to do to serve those around us?

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.830
Like Jesus is challenging
us to, in this statement,

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.110
it's a tough statement, but
I think it's something that

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.640
Jesus modeled for us, right.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:51.870
He modeled for us.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:53.500
And that's what we see
in this last example.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.190
Jesus sets the example in verse 28.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.640
He says just as the son, a man
did not come to be served, but to

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.280
serve and give his life as a ran.

00:27:03.465 --> 00:27:09.885
I think anything that seems difficult and
impossible, we wanna look for a way out.

00:27:10.065 --> 00:27:13.665
We wanna look for a reason why
we don't do it because you know,

00:27:14.385 --> 00:27:15.735
again, I'm not gifted enough.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:16.785
I don't have enough time.

00:27:16.785 --> 00:27:17.535
I don't have the right job.

00:27:17.535 --> 00:27:21.435
I don't have the right resources, whatever
it is, but Jesus sets the example.

00:27:21.885 --> 00:27:25.725
And the one thing I noticed about Jesus'
life, as I begin to look at, it was just

00:27:25.725 --> 00:27:27.105
let's let's walk through this together.

00:27:27.555 --> 00:27:30.615
Did Jesus have a ton
of financial resources?

00:27:30.825 --> 00:27:31.545
Was he rich?

00:27:32.715 --> 00:27:33.915
He was one of the most generous people.

00:27:33.915 --> 00:27:34.275
I know.

00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:42.105
I mean, Jesus lived on earth to fulfill
God's perfect plan of him dying on the

00:27:42.105 --> 00:27:45.765
cross for our sins and to train up these
disciples, he had plenty of things to do.

00:27:45.765 --> 00:27:51.015
Jesus was busy, but did it seem
like Jesus ever rushed anywhere?

00:27:52.665 --> 00:27:53.985
He, he walked everywhere.

00:27:54.285 --> 00:27:56.565
Did it seem like he was ever
interrupted by a person who

00:27:56.565 --> 00:27:58.305
was trying to touch his cloak?

00:27:58.305 --> 00:27:58.815
Just to be heal?

00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:03.449
Or in this instance, right after he
just said that he was going to, to

00:28:03.455 --> 00:28:06.810
die on the cross and be crucified
and to be raised again, that a mother

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.240
would come up and ask a question
and he says, what's your question?

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.340
Jesus had enough time.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:13.980
Jesus had enough resources.

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.500
Jesus was generous with what he had.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.250
See, that's what challenges me because
I look and I say, I don't have enough.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.230
I have too much, too much to do too many
things to spend money on and pay for.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.700
God's telling me over and over again that
he set the example through Jesus who had

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:35.070
less than I had in resources and probably
more of a bigger task to, to fulfill.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.260
And he seemed to have more
time than I have right now.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.710
So we see this, that Jesus came to
earth, not to just serve himself,

00:28:43.715 --> 00:28:46.530
but to serve us if he wanted to
serve himself, wanted it to be easy.

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.840
He could have just stayed
up in heaven, but he didn't.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.970
He said the example by laying down his.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:53.460
In giving us a new life.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.620
I want you to turn to John chapter 13,
we're gonna read verses one through 17.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:03.630
You would've heard me preach through
this when we did communion, but I wanna

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:07.920
read through it, touch a couple of
highlights and then we will close today.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.900
So John chapter 13, I'm gonna
read verses one through 17.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.520
I think that they'll be
up here on the screen as.

00:29:15.794 --> 00:29:16.574
But here's what it says.

00:29:16.574 --> 00:29:20.054
It says before the Passover
festival, Jesus knew that his

00:29:20.054 --> 00:29:23.925
hour had come to depart from this
world to the father, having loved

00:29:23.925 --> 00:29:25.365
his own, who were in the world.

00:29:25.365 --> 00:29:26.835
He loved them to the end.

00:29:27.855 --> 00:29:31.574
Now, when it was time for supper,
the devil had already put into

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:36.975
his heart into the heart of Judas
Simon's Iscariots son to betray him.

00:29:37.814 --> 00:29:40.695
Jesus knew that the father had
given everything into his hands

00:29:40.965 --> 00:29:43.125
and that he had come from God
and that he was going back to.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.720
And so he got up from the supper table
and laid at his outer clothing and took

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.340
a towel and tied it around himself.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.960
And next he poured water into a basin and
began to wash a disciple's feet and to

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.000
dry them with a towel tied around them.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.830
And it came to Simon, Peter who asked
him, Lord, are you going to wash my feet?

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.210
And Jesus answered him.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.440
What I'm doing.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.320
You don't realize now, but
afterwards you will understand,

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.180
you will never wash my feet, Peter.

00:30:09.955 --> 00:30:11.125
And Jesus replied.

00:30:11.125 --> 00:30:13.105
If I do not wash you,
you have no part with me.

00:30:13.555 --> 00:30:16.615
And so Simon Peter said to him,
Lord, only my F uh, not only my

00:30:16.615 --> 00:30:18.445
feet, but also my hands in my head.

00:30:18.895 --> 00:30:22.675
One who has Beed, Jesus told him does
not need to wash anything except his

00:30:22.675 --> 00:30:24.895
feet, but he has completely clean.

00:30:25.225 --> 00:30:29.095
You are clean, but not all of you
for he knew who would betray him.

00:30:29.185 --> 00:30:31.435
And this is why he said
not all of you're clean.

00:30:31.855 --> 00:30:34.735
And when Jesus had washed their feet
and put on their outer clothing,

00:30:34.885 --> 00:30:38.515
he reclined again and said to them,
do you know what I have done for.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.370
You call me teacher and Lord.

00:30:41.879 --> 00:30:44.370
And you were speaking rightly
since that's what I am.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:50.220
So if I, or Lord and teacher have washed
your feet, you also ought to wash one

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:54.210
another's feet where I have given you
an example that you also should do as I

00:30:54.215 --> 00:30:59.879
have done for you also, truly I tell you
a servant is not greater than his master.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:03.330
A messenger is not greater
than the one who sent him.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.689
If you know these things, you are blessed.

00:31:06.689 --> 00:31:07.280
If you do.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:11.639
If you hear this text, you see
how it's connected to everything

00:31:11.639 --> 00:31:12.629
we're talking about today.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:18.240
Jesus was heading towards the
cross to suffer for our sins and

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.160
he chose to serve his disciples.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:20.850
First.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.700
I'm just telling you
if I'm on my deathbed.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:28.950
If I know I'm getting ready to go
die, I'm probably asking for a steak

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.110
dinner and hang out with my family.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.410
I, I, there's a good chance.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:34.980
I'm not gonna tell you.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:35.850
Take off your shoes.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:36.000
Let.

00:31:36.735 --> 00:31:37.095
Get a TA.

00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:43.185
I'm just telling you that's me because
I tend to lean towards what serves me,

00:31:43.395 --> 00:31:46.155
but Jesus modeled at the end of his life.

00:31:46.335 --> 00:31:48.645
What it looks like to
serve those around him.

00:31:50.775 --> 00:31:52.365
Here's the, here's the interesting part.

00:31:52.515 --> 00:31:54.285
I just wanna walk through
this real quickly.

00:31:55.125 --> 00:31:56.295
Do you know who Jesus served?

00:31:57.015 --> 00:31:59.325
Not the easy people, the difficult people.

00:31:59.325 --> 00:32:00.615
Peter was difficult.

00:32:01.065 --> 00:32:04.275
If you know Peter, he seemed to
always push back against the plan.

00:32:04.275 --> 00:32:05.475
He tried to do it differently.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.639
And yeah, in the end, Peter said, yes.

00:32:08.639 --> 00:32:11.520
And in the end, even though Peter
rejected him, Peter came back to

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.560
him, but he was a difficult disciple.

00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:15.540
And I'm just telling you,
God probably looks at me and

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.770
says, you're a lot like Peter.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:18.720
And he still served me.

00:32:19.139 --> 00:32:19.470
And you know what?

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.150
That challenges me to do that.

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:22.980
Sometimes it's difficult
to serve those around you.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.780
It is difficult, but Jesus
modeled how we can overcome that

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.270
difficulty because he did not.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:34.410
Say, Hey everybody, but you, or if
you're not good enough, or if you

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.560
have the right, you know, heart,
no, he says I'm gonna serve you.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.550
And here's the second part.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.620
Jesus served even his own enemies.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:45.090
So not just the difficult people he's
talking about, the people who wanted

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:48.570
to kill him, that literally led to
his, if like he still served them.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:51.330
Like guys that is difficult to
say, let's take off your shoes

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:53.070
and wash your dirty, nasty feet.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.580
That is difficult, but Jesus modeled.

00:32:57.524 --> 00:33:01.575
Jesus the savior of the world, son
of God, humbled himself to serve his

00:33:01.575 --> 00:33:07.965
disciples and us because Jesus did more
than take off our shoes to wash our feet.

00:33:08.685 --> 00:33:13.215
He suffered on a cross because of all
the sins of our life and in our life and

00:33:13.215 --> 00:33:15.375
everything that has, we have fallen short.

00:33:15.495 --> 00:33:19.514
God has washed that away through
his son's death on the cross.

00:33:20.805 --> 00:33:28.155
So when we look to serving those around
us, As below us, or they're not good

00:33:28.155 --> 00:33:29.955
enough, or they're too difficult.

00:33:30.345 --> 00:33:32.745
We are saying that we are
greater than Jesus himself.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.455
And where are you seeing
this been in verse 16?

00:33:34.695 --> 00:33:38.564
He says, truly I tell you a servant
is not greater than his master.

00:33:38.655 --> 00:33:42.345
And everybody that has given their lives
to Christ has become a servant of Christ.

00:33:42.554 --> 00:33:46.245
And when we refuse to serve
those around us, we are refusing.

00:33:46.455 --> 00:33:49.155
We are actually making a statement
that we are better than Jesus.

00:33:50.855 --> 00:33:54.705
I just, I'm telling you right now that
I ask God to continue to help me to

00:33:54.705 --> 00:34:01.035
never say that I am better than Jesus,
because I am not, I am better because

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.525
of Jesus, but I'm not better than Jesus.

00:34:03.855 --> 00:34:05.415
The one who served me first.

00:34:06.915 --> 00:34:10.485
So as we, we conclude and as we
finish up today, and as we think

00:34:10.485 --> 00:34:15.255
through our mission as a church to
inspire hope and help people discover

00:34:15.255 --> 00:34:16.965
their purpose, every single person.

00:34:17.565 --> 00:34:22.725
Has a next step to following Jesus and
having a relationship with Jesus guys.

00:34:22.725 --> 00:34:25.095
We can't miss this important part.

00:34:25.425 --> 00:34:28.605
I, I, I we're walking through
this and this is the important

00:34:28.605 --> 00:34:31.635
part you're connected to a church.

00:34:31.635 --> 00:34:33.405
Not because that's what you have to do.

00:34:33.855 --> 00:34:36.255
Not because we're just some
random church on the corner

00:34:36.255 --> 00:34:37.305
that you're just gonna go to.

00:34:37.514 --> 00:34:41.565
But because you believe in the
mission and fulfilling that mission

00:34:41.775 --> 00:34:45.795
by following Jesus, living in
community, serving those around you.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:48.540
And expanding God's kingdom,
which we'll talk about in a couple

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:52.259
of weeks as we don't do that,
because it's a cool statement.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.299
We do it because that's what Jesus did.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:58.830
We don't serve those around us because
it, it benefits us and that's gonna get

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.680
us somewhere further in the kingdom of
God, or God's looking at us and saying,

00:35:01.685 --> 00:35:03.060
okay, you can get in because you serve.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.140
No, we serve because we were served first.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.680
I think it's easy after looking, I say
easy but easy after reading these two.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:16.410
That as a church, it's logical for us as a
church to, to continue to take next steps

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:18.030
in the area of serving those around us.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.160
I want you during this time of invitation,
I want you to think, what does it look

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.400
like in my life to serve those around me?

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.580
Let me just give you some examples.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:33.600
Some things you can pray over to take
a next step in for some of you that

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.140
first step could just be in a part of
our church and serving in our church.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.380
You know, you may think, but
that's what everybody else does.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.150
It's not easy for me, but for you, maybe
it's for you to, to be a part of one of

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.960
our ministry teams to be a part of kids or
students or greeting or cafe or music to

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.850
serve those around you in that capacity.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.190
If you're not doing it,
that's a great next step.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.620
Maybe it's to be a part of surf Sunday.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.360
So next week is surf Sunday.

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.100
I think this sets up perfect guys.

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:03.300
Next week, surf Sunday, don't
look at it as I'll let the rest

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:07.680
of the church do that while I get
to sleep in for once whyt come.

00:36:08.715 --> 00:36:13.965
And help us serve our teachers by putting
together these gifts and making these

00:36:13.965 --> 00:36:16.395
posters and, and praying over them.

00:36:16.635 --> 00:36:17.715
And here's the cool part.

00:36:17.895 --> 00:36:20.325
You can be a part of that by, we're
gonna talk about this a little bit

00:36:20.325 --> 00:36:23.805
later, but you can bring pastries next
week or something for breakfast that,

00:36:24.105 --> 00:36:25.815
that can basically go on a fridge.

00:36:25.815 --> 00:36:28.005
Or if it doesn't have to go on a fridge,
we're gonna give those to teachers

00:36:28.215 --> 00:36:31.245
a week from tomorrow, um, to them.

00:36:31.545 --> 00:36:33.855
So you can help us serve our
community by serving on Sunday.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.440
Here's something just giving
you another practical.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.530
In, in September, we're doing something
called shoes for the shoeless.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.810
At Riverview elementary,
we're partnering with them.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:45.570
We need people to go with us to
the school and help put shoes on

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:49.200
kids and give them shoes for you.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.060
It could be serving your neighbors.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:55.740
You know, what you could do if their
grass is long, don't just call the

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.510
HOA and complain about 'em go mow it.

00:37:02.475 --> 00:37:03.495
Bring them cookies.

00:37:03.825 --> 00:37:07.095
You don't make good cookies, go to
Walmart, buy 'em, knock on the door

00:37:07.095 --> 00:37:10.665
and say, I wanted to serve you today
because God has so changed my life.

00:37:10.725 --> 00:37:11.775
And I hope you're having a good day.

00:37:12.765 --> 00:37:15.855
Like those are small
things to be like Christ.

00:37:17.325 --> 00:37:17.895
You know what you can do?

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.275
You can, you can go to inspire group.

00:37:20.235 --> 00:37:21.435
You know, I gave out cards last week.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.025
If you didn't get a card, you can
go back to the next steps table.

00:37:23.025 --> 00:37:26.115
I gave out a card for you to circle
a night or a day in which you could

00:37:26.115 --> 00:37:27.285
be a part of an inspire group.

00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:29.175
You know that one of the
greatest ways that you can serve

00:37:29.175 --> 00:37:30.075
is be a part of an inspire.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.839
Participate and get involved
with what they're doing.

00:37:34.799 --> 00:37:37.049
Something you heard me talk
about earlier generosity.

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:41.430
You know, how you could start serving as
a, as a church start giving consistently,

00:37:42.029 --> 00:37:46.080
you know that as you give, we actually
go out and give back to our community.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:50.640
And right now, as a church we're year
and a half in and 40% of our budget

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.259
is funded by our current membership.

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:55.080
The other 60% is outside
people that are from different

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.040
states that are funding our.

00:37:57.105 --> 00:37:58.575
That's gonna go away at one point.

00:37:59.265 --> 00:38:03.045
And that means we, all of us
can take a responsibility to say

00:38:03.045 --> 00:38:04.365
we wanna serve our community.

00:38:04.365 --> 00:38:07.965
Well, continue to serve our community
well, by giving consistently

00:38:08.475 --> 00:38:11.475
greatest way to give consistently
is set it up online, give each week.

00:38:11.895 --> 00:38:13.905
That's a great way that you
can serve those around you.

00:38:14.715 --> 00:38:15.975
But why do we do this guys?

00:38:15.975 --> 00:38:16.575
I'll just tell you this.

00:38:16.575 --> 00:38:17.715
It goes back to this.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:22.770
I only do things when I
think they're valuable.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.880
When I see the difference, it
makes in someone else's life.

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:29.670
We are doing this because
we know that we are pointing

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:31.589
people to Jesus by how we serve.

00:38:32.415 --> 00:38:32.835
Jesus.

00:38:32.835 --> 00:38:36.825
Didn't die for people to just get great
things and, you know, get served, but

00:38:36.825 --> 00:38:39.585
he died so that people could experience
a personal relationship with him.

00:38:40.004 --> 00:38:43.544
So whatever next step that God is
calling you to take it today during

00:38:43.544 --> 00:38:46.875
this time of invitation, pray and
ask God how you take a next step in

00:38:46.875 --> 00:38:48.315
the area of serving those around you.

00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:52.544
If you haven't given your life to Jesus,
if that's your next step, if you're

00:38:52.544 --> 00:38:54.825
sitting here thinking I can't even serve
anybody around me because I haven't

00:38:54.825 --> 00:38:58.575
got my relationship where I with the
Lord today is the day of salvation.

00:38:59.115 --> 00:39:00.615
You can give your life to Jesus.

00:39:00.975 --> 00:39:06.525
You can say, I repented my sins and I
turn to you Lord, during invitation.

00:39:06.525 --> 00:39:08.115
I'm always in the back
there to talk with you.

00:39:08.115 --> 00:39:11.295
If you have questions about that, if
you have questions about, you know,

00:39:11.295 --> 00:39:18.165
needing prayer, just come talk to me,
but I know this, you consistently, we

00:39:18.165 --> 00:39:19.665
all need to ask ourselves this question.

00:39:19.695 --> 00:39:22.095
What is stopping us from
taking the next step?

00:39:22.395 --> 00:39:25.485
And if I can challenge you on
the back end of this, you wanna

00:39:25.485 --> 00:39:26.295
know what's gonna stop you.

00:39:26.295 --> 00:39:28.095
It's the same way it's
gonna stop me selfish.

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.780
You're gonna walk outta here and
you're gonna go, you know what?

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:34.260
I don't have to do that to be
saved and maybe you're right.

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:41.610
But I would say this, that if, if you're
having that heart, because of selfishness

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.460
that I believe the Lord's gonna convict
you because we can't stay in that place.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.100
We can't stay where we are.

00:39:49.395 --> 00:39:52.815
And just rest on what we did in the past,
but God is calling us to take a next step.

00:39:53.024 --> 00:39:53.565
What is it?

00:39:54.524 --> 00:39:56.444
You pray and ask the Lord
during this time of invitation.

00:39:56.774 --> 00:39:57.345
Lord Jesus.

00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:57.825
We love you.

00:39:57.825 --> 00:40:02.835
And we pray Lord that you help
us Lord get outta the way.

00:40:04.634 --> 00:40:13.815
Lord, may I, as, as, um, the pastor, Lord
be a model in this, may I take a next.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.799
In the area of serving Lord,
will you convict my heart?

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:23.130
Will you clearly give me
direction on how I can serve?

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:26.490
Not only our church better, but our
community better those around me at

00:40:26.495 --> 00:40:29.100
the gym or in my home or at the store.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:35.880
Lord help me because I wanna be a
part of seeing your kingdom expanded.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.509
I wanna be a part of seeing more
and more people come to faith in

00:40:39.509 --> 00:40:41.140
you because of the way that I.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.310
Not for my glory, but yours, Lord.

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:45.960
I know I'm not the only one in this room.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.910
That's thinking that same thing,
Lord, I pray that every person that

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:53.399
is hearing this today, every person
that will watch this later this

00:40:53.404 --> 00:40:55.500
week, because they were serving or
they couldn't make it to church.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:00.540
Lord, I pray that you are giving them
direction right now on how they can take

00:41:00.544 --> 00:41:02.149
a next step to serve those around them.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.029
Lord, just pray this in your heaven name.

00:41:06.359 --> 00:41:06.690
Amen.
