00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.900
Hey, look Dad, there's some footage
with you in it, which is pretty rare

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.820
since you like to be behind the camera.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.990
There you are feeding me some ice
cream while something is definitely

00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:20.430
going on with that shirt collar.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.210
Hey, remember that time that you
were filming us and Missy hit

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.590
me with that jump rope thingy?

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:26.565
See, watch.

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:29.055
Here she goes, 3, 2, 1.

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:29.655
Boom.

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:34.275
I doubt it really hurt, but I
cried and said, Missy, hit me.

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:35.925
See, watch my lips.

00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:39.345
Missy hit me.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:40.785
What did you do?

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:42.975
You pointed and said,
go hit her right back.

00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:44.565
So I did.

00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:49.065
Look, it wasn't your best
advice, and that's okay.

00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:51.195
And now she's coming after me.

00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:51.825
Oh, okay.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:52.394
Okay.

00:00:52.905 --> 00:00:53.925
Well look, let's face it.

00:00:54.434 --> 00:00:59.955
You were balancing a career, a marriage,
and the most time consuming of all being a

00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:02.324
dad, and we knew how to push your buttons.

00:01:02.775 --> 00:01:07.425
We were experts at crying for
no reason in the same way.

00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:09.884
There's no reason to
spin that in front of me.

00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:12.495
It will make me come after you, sis.

00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:16.845
Anyway, I'm thankful that you
stuck with us and didn't stop.

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:19.215
You didn't stop showing grace.

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.854
You didn't stop loving us where we were.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.370
You didn't stop filming your son when he
basically curled up into a ball of tears,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.160
but you honored the Sacred Dad rule.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.350
Keep the camera rolling
to all the dads out there.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.910
Happy Father's Day.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.370
Thanks for letting us have a good
cry for no reason, and then off.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.120
All right, well, welcome back everybody.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.280
Um, hoping that you guys all
have some amazing plans today.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.920
I got asked the question, what
am I doing for Father's Day?

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:03.390
I'm taking a nap.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.400
That's success for me because I feel
guilty every other day of the year when

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.250
I go home and take a nap on Father's
Day, I'm like, this is something I've

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.340
earned all year, so I'm gonna sleep good.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.990
Don't text me between one and three.

00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:18.555
Yes, I do sleep for two hours.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:19.395
That does happen.

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:22.395
Um, if you're anything like me, you
don't go to take naps in the bed.

00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:24.165
If you do that, you won't
wake up till the next day.

00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:28.485
I do it in the living room so that at
some point the kids annoy me enough that

00:02:28.485 --> 00:02:30.915
I get up and then I don't sleep all night.

00:02:30.975 --> 00:02:34.665
So anyways, hey, happy Father's Day.

00:02:34.665 --> 00:02:37.305
I know I've already said that
before, but um, you know, whenever

00:02:37.305 --> 00:02:40.755
we started thinking about Father's
Day, and you know, sometimes whenever

00:02:40.755 --> 00:02:42.135
we have special days like this, we.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.020
Do a theme Father's Day where we
take a message and we jump in, and

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.060
sometimes we're just gonna continue
on the series that we're in.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.630
Well, last week we actually finished up
our series, so this is a great opportunity

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.730
to jump into a Father's Day message.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.910
And so I wanna start off by
saying, number one, if you're

00:02:56.915 --> 00:02:58.080
sitting in this room and going.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.185
But I'm not a father.

00:03:00.265 --> 00:03:01.345
Um, hey, it's okay.

00:03:01.345 --> 00:03:03.535
This message will still speak to
you, and so I'll give you kind

00:03:03.535 --> 00:03:04.375
of a couple of different levels.

00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:08.424
Number one, this message will
speak to fathers, aspiring fathers,

00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:12.295
speak to parents, aspiring parents,
and if you're a kid in the room,

00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:14.245
this'll just, it'll be good.

00:03:14.484 --> 00:03:14.635
Okay?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.114
It'll be good.

00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:18.475
It's, it's, it's actually what I would
say this is if you are a kid in the

00:03:18.475 --> 00:03:21.174
room and you're saying, man, what?

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.549
As a godly parent today, I hope that
you'll learn what that is, and hopefully

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.060
you see that in your parents, and
if you don't, don't call 'em out.

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.899
Encourage them.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.190
Okay, encourage them.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.650
Um, so I hope that it
really encourages you today.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.520
I know it did for me.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.550
So we're gonna be in Deuteronomy
chapter six and we're gonna go

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.770
through verses one through nine today.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.950
Um, and, uh, we'll, we'll talk a
little bit more about that, but I

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.120
wanna talk about the idea behind
fathers have one of the greatest

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.070
influences on their children's lives.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.910
And you know, most of us say, well,
duh, I believe fathers actually have

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.490
the ability to have the greatest
influence on their children.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.840
That's not a knock towards mom.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.820
So if you're in this room,
don't throw trash at me.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.510
Mothers make an amazing difference
in their children's lives.

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.630
Well, when we begin to think about,
even statistics will tell you this.

00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:09.645
That fathers make some
of the greatest impacts.

00:04:09.855 --> 00:04:13.185
Um, and so I was just doing a little
bit of research in national centers

00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:17.835
for fathering says this, that children
from fatherless homes are more likely

00:04:17.835 --> 00:04:22.425
to be poor, become involved in drug and
alcohol abuse, drop out of school, suffer

00:04:22.425 --> 00:04:24.075
from health and emotional problems.

00:04:24.435 --> 00:04:28.005
Boys are more likely to become
involved in crime and girls are more

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:30.555
likely to become pregnant as teens.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.750
And then I just begin to do a little bit
more reading that 25% of homes that have

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.180
children in them have absent fathers.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.409
And then if you even begin to
look into, um, basically people

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.099
that are incarcerated, over 85% of
the people that are incarcerated

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.200
grew up in non father homes.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.090
And so we find that, that that
statistic begins to be a big deal

00:04:52.094 --> 00:04:53.469
that fathers do make a difference.

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:56.380
And in that same article that I
was reading, they said that there

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.020
was a ministry that was actually
ministering to this prison.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.230
And there was over a thousand inmates.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.680
And what they would do is on Mother's
Day, they would offer up the opportunity

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.880
that they could write Mother's Day cards.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.990
They would give 'em cards to write.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.900
And about a, you know, I think
it was about three quarters of

00:05:09.905 --> 00:05:13.080
the people requested Mother's Day
cards when it came to Father's Day.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.280
Three people.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.159
And that same a thousand, uh, room
prison requested Father's Day cards.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.849
And so what we see is that fathers
can make either a positive.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.560
Or a negative impact.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.940
And so fathers, hopefully that
encourages you, not discourages

00:05:29.945 --> 00:05:31.920
you of the importance of your role.

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.150
And my hope today is that through the
word of God, that we'll learn how to

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.040
play an important role in our children's
lives, um, and not look at it as a burden.

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.190
And so fathers set the example, and I
want you to leave with that thought.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.719
Father, set the example.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.349
And again, if you're not a father in this
room, Parents set the example, or I wanna

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:58.539
make this one statement, aspiring fathers
or parents, don't wait until you have kids

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:02.020
to start working on being a good parent.

00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:06.159
Don't wait until you have kids to
start working on being a good parent.

00:06:06.164 --> 00:06:09.250
You can actually prepare now and
we'll talk about how that works.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.370
And then the reason why I even say that,
I'd say that from experience because

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.229
it took us having our first child.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.200
And Brittany looking at me and saying,
Hey, we gotta get this, um, you

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.490
know, spiritual thing figured out.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.930
And I was like, well, what do you mean?

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.640
She's like, I wanna raise
my kids in the church.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.560
And I'm like, okay.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.780
And she's like, but I want
you to lead us to do that.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.460
I'm like, okay.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.610
And it took me a little over a
year to figure out how to do that

00:06:32.615 --> 00:06:35.490
and coming to faith in Christ and
trying to figure those things out.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.620
And I just think, man, if I could
have figured that out earlier.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.230
So that's just hopefully
an encouragement to you.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.330
Um, but it has been said that.

00:06:42.825 --> 00:06:45.465
It only takes a few minutes to
become a father, but it takes

00:06:45.465 --> 00:06:47.175
a lifetime to become a dad.

00:06:47.175 --> 00:06:50.475
And I think that's something that
I've learned that, um, after four

00:06:50.475 --> 00:06:53.685
kids, um, that I didn't really
get it right with the first one.

00:06:54.165 --> 00:06:56.565
Got a little bit better with the second
one, and by the fourth one, he's just

00:06:56.565 --> 00:06:58.545
spoiled and I'm always Got it right.

00:06:58.545 --> 00:06:58.785
Right.

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:00.015
Because he just gets whatever he wants.

00:07:00.015 --> 00:07:03.045
But it seems like we're
always trying to get better.

00:07:03.135 --> 00:07:05.235
We're wanting to be a better
father, better parent.

00:07:05.505 --> 00:07:09.615
Um, we're wanting to be better and
uh, I think that the Lord guides

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.935
us through that in his word.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.555
And whenever I begin to think about.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.680
A list of things that
fathers teach their children.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.490
I think of fathers are responsible in
teaching their children to follow Jesus.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.000
I think of fathers teaching their
children how to respect their mother,

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:27.160
um, to respect other people, uh, to be
responsible, have a good work ethic.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.070
And that list could go
over and on and on and on.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.330
But when I think about our kids and we
think about the influence that we have,

00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:38.415
We set the example and I want you guys to
see this quick video that actually Peyton

00:07:38.415 --> 00:07:44.175
sent me this past week of a funny, uh, way
that a, a father, um, impacts his kids.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.425
And so see if they can play
that video and see if it works.

00:07:47.595 --> 00:07:50.415
You may have seen this one
before, watching a football game.

00:07:51.825 --> 00:07:56.715
Kids super happy Dad's not
sees his dad not happy and

00:07:56.715 --> 00:07:58.095
he follows after his example.

00:07:58.185 --> 00:07:59.625
Is this not reality?

00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:03.225
Our kids are always watches and
I think that's so funny because.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.650
That's what they do.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.800
I remember, and I should have showed
the video of Chaney whenever he was

00:08:07.805 --> 00:08:11.640
younger, he was in, again, forgive me,
I know we're not in Sooner country,

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.330
but we are fans of Oklahoma Sooners
and he was wearing his Sooners little

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.290
onesie and he could barely speak and
I had taught him how to say football.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.400
And so I would say it and he
would say football, and that's

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.479
about the only thing he could say.

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:24.500
And we recorded that.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.929
And the thing was is that
he was modeling after me.

00:08:26.929 --> 00:08:29.419
I was teaching him, I
was setting the example.

00:08:29.424 --> 00:08:33.409
And to this day, my son's a huge
OU fan in Ohio, which is crazy.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.390
Um, and so, I look at this saying,
we all set the example in this

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.770
and what we teach our kids.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.380
Um, and so I wanna dive into this
today, but I really wanna give

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.800
you some background in Deuteronomy
before we jump into reading the text.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.760
Um, but with Deuteronomy, this
is the fifth book of the law.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.720
And so the first five books of the Bible
are called the Torah, uh, or the Law.

00:08:52.725 --> 00:08:55.990
And this is where we learned
Moses was most likely the writer

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:57.400
of these first five books.

00:08:57.584 --> 00:09:00.915
And he had already shared
the law, what God had given

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.295
him to share with the people.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:05.744
And the first thing that he
gave the law to the people they

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.944
rebelled, they did not obey the
law and what their consequence was.

00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:13.574
If you remember with Moses, Moses
led the people out of Egypt.

00:09:13.995 --> 00:09:15.075
They were enslaved in Egypt.

00:09:15.075 --> 00:09:16.185
He led them out of Egypt.

00:09:16.185 --> 00:09:17.865
He was leaving them to the Promised Land.

00:09:18.135 --> 00:09:19.275
He gave them the law.

00:09:19.545 --> 00:09:23.295
They decided to reject the law and
to reject really trusting the Lord.

00:09:23.295 --> 00:09:26.925
And so their punishment was they
would never inherit the promised land.

00:09:27.225 --> 00:09:30.915
And then Moses did something that
didn't allow him to inherit the promised

00:09:30.915 --> 00:09:34.275
land, but he had a responsibility
to teach the next generation that

00:09:34.275 --> 00:09:35.415
was gonna go into the promised land.

00:09:35.415 --> 00:09:36.795
And this is kind of
where we're picking up.

00:09:37.095 --> 00:09:40.845
And Deuteronomy is the second
proclamation of the law.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.310
And I dunno if you guys ever read
the Bible sometimes and you're

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:44.900
like, didn't it already say this?

00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:46.579
Didn't we already learn this?

00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:47.810
Why are they repeating the law?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.070
Because they easily forgot the
law and so he had to repeat it

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.290
again to the next generation.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.080
And so that's kind of where we're
picking up here is Moses speaking

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.420
and preparing the next generation
for experiencing and inheriting the

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.160
promised land that God had for them.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.700
And so in the first three chapters
of Deuteronomy, Moses is reminding

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.280
the next generation of what
happened to their parents before.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:12.270
Right?

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.160
And then in the next couple of chapters
in verse or chapters four through five,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.640
He calls them to obedience and commitment
to the law, and this is where we get

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.500
in Deuteronomy chapter five is the.

00:10:22.965 --> 00:10:26.055
10 commandments, and most of us have
heard those and memorized those.

00:10:26.055 --> 00:10:28.275
And so he gives them the 10
commandments in chapter five.

00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:33.075
And then today we're picking up in
chapter six, uh, where Moses is gonna

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.425
talk about the greatest command.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:38.385
If you have ever read in the
gospels, Jesus repeats this greatest

00:10:38.385 --> 00:10:40.215
command and then he adds one to it.

00:10:40.215 --> 00:10:42.075
And so we'll talk about that today.

00:10:42.165 --> 00:10:44.625
And so whenever we're reading this
text, a lot of times, this is how I

00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:47.355
read the text, and I wanna continue
to encourage you and teach you

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.915
how, whenever I jump into the word.

00:10:49.755 --> 00:10:53.385
How I read it, I want you to read it
today and listen to it today as though

00:10:53.385 --> 00:10:55.695
Moses is speaking directly to you.

00:10:56.535 --> 00:10:58.965
Some of the context is gonna be a little
bit different because we're not going

00:10:58.965 --> 00:11:03.075
into the promised land, but what I would
say is we are going into the next day

00:11:03.075 --> 00:11:07.515
of our lives, the, the land and the life
and the calling that God has given us.

00:11:07.605 --> 00:11:10.575
And so as we are going into
this life, I encourage you to

00:11:10.575 --> 00:11:12.255
listen to what Moses is speaking.

00:11:12.584 --> 00:11:14.084
To you in this.

00:11:14.594 --> 00:11:17.415
Um, and before I jump into this
text, I wanna ask this question

00:11:17.444 --> 00:11:23.145
to those who are parents, fathers,
aspiring parents, do you desire to

00:11:23.145 --> 00:11:25.605
see your kids come to know Jesus?

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:29.055
Awesome.

00:11:29.175 --> 00:11:35.385
Well, today I believe that you'll learn
along with me how we can help that and

00:11:35.385 --> 00:11:37.635
help our kids by setting the example.

00:11:37.935 --> 00:11:41.145
And so let's read this text today
again, Deuteronomy chapter six.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.630
Verses one through nine.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:47.310
It says this, this is the command,
the statutes, and the ordinances.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.810
The Lord your God has commanded
me to teach you so that you

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.350
may follow them in the land you
are about to enter and possess.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.000
Do this so that you may fear the Lord
your God all the days of your life by

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.250
keeping all of his statutes and commands.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:07.140
I'm giving you your son and your grandson
so that you may have a long life.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.510
Listen Israel and be careful.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:14.490
Follow them so that you may prosper and
multiply greatly because the Lord, the

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:18.990
God of your fathers has promised you a
land of flowing of with milk and honey.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.189
Listen, Israel, the Lord
our God, the Lord is one.

00:12:23.819 --> 00:12:26.670
Love the Lord your God with all
your heart, with all your soul,

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.719
and with all your strength.

00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:32.459
These words that I'm giving you
today are to be in your heart.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:34.319
Repeat them to your children.

00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:37.829
Talk about them when you sit in
your house and when you walk along

00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:39.270
the road, and when you lie down.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:43.109
And when you get up, bind them as
a sign on your hand and let them

00:12:43.114 --> 00:12:44.699
be a symbol on your forehead.

00:12:45.119 --> 00:12:49.170
Write them on the doorposts of
your house and on your city gates.

00:12:49.574 --> 00:12:50.055
Let's pray.

00:12:50.265 --> 00:12:54.405
Lord Jesus, we pray that your word
begins to penetrate our hearts and our

00:12:54.405 --> 00:12:58.305
lives, Lord, that we take something from
this today and we learn how to set the

00:12:58.305 --> 00:13:03.915
example for the next generation, uh,
for our kids, for our grandkids, uh,

00:13:03.944 --> 00:13:06.015
for the future people that will impact.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.015
Lord, I just pray that you guide us
today as we walk through your word and

00:13:09.015 --> 00:13:10.275
we just pray this in your heavenly name.

00:13:10.785 --> 00:13:11.115
Amen.

00:13:12.045 --> 00:13:15.015
So, two things that we're
gonna prioritize as.

00:13:15.464 --> 00:13:16.875
Fathers parents.

00:13:16.875 --> 00:13:20.354
Again, I wanna continue to see, uh, as
I begin to talk today, make sure that

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.035
you're hearing what I'm saying today.

00:13:22.365 --> 00:13:26.474
Um, two things that we can prioritize
in order to be a godly example to

00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:28.545
our children or our grandchildren.

00:13:29.324 --> 00:13:32.295
Um, and so the first one that we
learned in this text is to have a

00:13:32.295 --> 00:13:33.944
personal relationship with Jesus.

00:13:33.974 --> 00:13:35.415
Now that sounds very logical.

00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:39.645
You expect the pastor to say this first
step of being a godly example is to

00:13:39.645 --> 00:13:41.055
have a personal relationship with Jesus.

00:13:41.145 --> 00:13:42.495
That seems like a dust statement.

00:13:44.954 --> 00:13:51.855
But I know a lot of parents that would
say this, I want my kids to go to church.

00:13:54.045 --> 00:13:56.564
And they would drop their kids off
to youth group and they would leave.

00:13:57.345 --> 00:14:00.675
I want my kids to grow up in the church,
and they come to church and they put

00:14:00.675 --> 00:14:04.485
their kids in class and they're happy that
their kids are learning about Jesus, but

00:14:04.485 --> 00:14:07.755
they're really just sitting in service
to make sure their kids get Jesus.

00:14:08.685 --> 00:14:12.405
They, they also, I know parents that
say this, Hey, I wanna get my kids

00:14:12.405 --> 00:14:16.365
in the church because I need them
to teach them about Jesus because

00:14:16.725 --> 00:14:17.954
I don't know what, how to do it.

00:14:18.584 --> 00:14:26.115
And so I say this to the fact is God has
given the responsibility to you to help

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:29.324
your kids know Jesus, not the churches.

00:14:29.925 --> 00:14:31.005
And how do we know that?

00:14:31.005 --> 00:14:36.255
We know that because Moses, his
role was to teach the parents.

00:14:36.645 --> 00:14:37.755
To teach the next generation.

00:14:37.755 --> 00:14:40.605
So we're gonna kinda look at this
where Moses is speaking in this text

00:14:40.605 --> 00:14:42.705
specifically to the leaders of Israel.

00:14:42.705 --> 00:14:45.075
And when you begin to look at the
leaders of Israel, they were men.

00:14:45.225 --> 00:14:48.495
And this is nothing of against the women,
but typically the men's responsibility

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.235
was to lead the home spiritually.

00:14:50.565 --> 00:14:53.685
I was actually having an amazing
conversation that I won't get all in.

00:14:54.015 --> 00:14:56.385
Last night right after dinner was
talking with Jason and Christina

00:14:56.385 --> 00:14:58.065
and this idea behind the men's role.

00:14:58.125 --> 00:15:03.105
And the men's role is not to be a
dictator to to truly be a servant.

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:05.475
Someone who sets the example.

00:15:06.015 --> 00:15:06.615
In the home.

00:15:07.425 --> 00:15:11.205
So men, whenever you wanna
be like, woman submit, that's

00:15:11.205 --> 00:15:12.615
probably not a good thing to say.

00:15:12.615 --> 00:15:14.385
If you want, don't wanna
get smacked upside the head.

00:15:14.805 --> 00:15:19.305
Um, but really it's, it's truly
serving not only your spouse, but

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:24.225
your children in such a way that
you can model who God is to them.

00:15:24.705 --> 00:15:26.145
That's on us.

00:15:26.265 --> 00:15:27.615
That is on us.

00:15:27.705 --> 00:15:31.695
And I, I would say this, that God
wants to do that in and through us.

00:15:31.755 --> 00:15:34.814
So our, our children not only
need us to love the Lord, but they

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.855
need us to set the example, right?

00:15:36.945 --> 00:15:40.545
We can't just send them to church and
expect the church to be the only thing

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.135
that invests in them spiritually.

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:45.000
Uh, but God has called
us to lead the families.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.349
And how do we know that?

00:15:46.349 --> 00:15:49.560
Again, we look at this, Moses' role
was to teach, and whenever I sit

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.229
up here today, my role is to teach.

00:15:52.229 --> 00:15:56.550
My role is not to just be the only
influence in your children's life,

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.459
to help them come to faith in Christ,
grow in their relationship with Christ.

00:15:59.699 --> 00:16:03.510
And if they fail, it's not my
responsibility in that either.

00:16:03.515 --> 00:16:06.750
It's, it's really on you and
that sounds, again, really tough.

00:16:07.485 --> 00:16:11.775
But we see this, that Moses's role is to
teach the word of God, and it says its

00:16:11.775 --> 00:16:14.685
statues and its ordinances to inform you.

00:16:15.074 --> 00:16:17.204
But what is your role?

00:16:17.204 --> 00:16:20.535
What is my role as a
parent is to follow them.

00:16:20.535 --> 00:16:24.584
If you'll see this here again, he says,
this is my command and to teach you

00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:26.505
the statues and the ordinances, right?

00:16:26.834 --> 00:16:30.645
And he says it's, you may follow them
in the land you're about to enter.

00:16:30.735 --> 00:16:32.895
So I want you to think about this as.

00:16:33.555 --> 00:16:38.745
I'm teaching you as Moses is teaching you,
as the word of God is teaching you daily.

00:16:39.615 --> 00:16:44.355
Your role and responsibility is to follow
what you're being taught to follow it.

00:16:44.685 --> 00:16:46.875
And he says in the land
you're about to enter.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:52.845
And I would say this, he's telling you
to follow into the land you're about to

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:57.555
enter into your homes and into your jobs
tomorrow and into your kids' activities

00:16:57.555 --> 00:16:59.805
the next day and wherever you go.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:06.000
You are to follow these commands, not out
of religious duty, but because you see

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.050
what God has given you as an is something
greater, something to be passed on.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.250
I would say this, many of us, if we
have an inheritance, we wanna pass

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.750
it on to our kids and bless them.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:20.520
The greatest inheritance you
will ever have is the spiritual

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.990
inheritance that you pass on.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.470
You have such an opportunity to do that.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:28.410
And so when we look at
this, it is our role.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.620
To be a part of helping them, right?

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.830
To, to see that, that we
are the ones to follow.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.720
And so we move on here and it, and it says
specifically here at the end of verse two.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:45.149
Um, uh, it says, do this so that you
may fear the Lord your God all the

00:17:45.149 --> 00:17:49.439
days of your life by keeping all of
its statues and commands as I've given

00:17:49.439 --> 00:17:51.959
you to your son and to your grandson.

00:17:52.485 --> 00:17:55.395
And so whenever he's looking
at this, it's not just for you.

00:17:55.514 --> 00:17:59.205
And when we talk about God's called
you to personally follow him, but it's

00:17:59.205 --> 00:18:03.044
really, he's called you to personally
follow him so that it can be passed down

00:18:03.044 --> 00:18:05.084
to your son and your grandson again.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:08.415
Why is he only speaking to men
so you don't feel left out here

00:18:08.564 --> 00:18:10.125
again, the man's responsibility.

00:18:10.125 --> 00:18:13.425
We think about this time, the man's
responsibility was to lead his home.

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:17.835
But in that day, it was actually
to also train up his son in

00:18:17.835 --> 00:18:18.915
the way that he should go.

00:18:19.215 --> 00:18:22.215
So just to kinda give you some examples,
when you begin to look back in history

00:18:22.395 --> 00:18:25.575
at about age three, no matter if
you were a daughter or a son, you

00:18:25.575 --> 00:18:27.524
will begin training for your future.

00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:31.725
The wives would take the responsibility
with the ladies to teach them home stuff

00:18:31.725 --> 00:18:34.425
because that was their role at that
time, and that's not a sexist thing.

00:18:34.575 --> 00:18:35.535
That was just their role.

00:18:35.655 --> 00:18:37.755
They learned how to do homely
duties, but it was also the mother's

00:18:37.755 --> 00:18:41.295
responsibility to train her up
to know how to be a godly woman.

00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:44.055
But it was also the husband's
responsibility to train their son

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.515
at age three, how to be a godly son.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.389
And follower of God.

00:18:48.719 --> 00:18:51.270
And not only did he teach 'em
about God, he taught 'em about,

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.250
uh, how to learn a job trade.

00:18:53.399 --> 00:18:54.330
He taught 'em also.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:54.750
Here's fun.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.639
One of the funny things, one of
the things that they were required

00:18:56.639 --> 00:18:58.050
to teach them was how to swim.

00:18:58.139 --> 00:19:00.360
I guess there must have been a
lot of water around there is why

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.290
they had to teach 'em how to swim.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.260
So dad's that your responsibility
to teach your son how to swim.

00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:08.639
Okay, so I, I look at this and say
that was why he was speaking directly

00:19:08.639 --> 00:19:13.620
to the fathers is because it was their
role to teach their sons and to be

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.689
a godly example for their families.

00:19:16.199 --> 00:19:20.340
Um, And, and I think it's so
important for us not to miss that,

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.250
that it's our responsibility in this.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.600
So when we think about the fathers
and the mother's role investing in

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.600
this, he goes on in verse three to
to go a little bit further, right?

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.430
He says, do this so that
you may fear the Lord.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:36.510
And just so you know what it comes
to fearing the Lord, this is not like

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.000
fear as though he's gonna smite me.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.490
I look at fear as something
that we place as honorable.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:50.220
Something that we basically are
choosing to submit ourselves to

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.660
because we know it is greater.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:57.060
And I would say this, we're also modeling
to our kids when we submit ourselves to

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.740
the Lord, what it means to fear the Lord,
that he has something greater, that he is

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.850
something in his word, and, and then the
commands that we follow something greater.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.180
And so he says, obviously to fear
the Lord, but then he goes on

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.190
in verse three and he says this.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.530
He says, um, where am I at my.

00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.879
I gotta find three.

00:20:14.879 --> 00:20:15.210
There it is.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:20.550
Listen, Israel and be careful to
follow so that you may prosper and

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:24.690
multiply greatly because the Lord
your God, the God of your fathers has

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.120
promised you a land of milk and honey.

00:20:27.629 --> 00:20:29.040
He uses this word careful.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.399
And whenever I begin to just
envision what does careful mean?

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.580
I, I think of being careful
in the fact of walking up.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.810
A cliff and I'm being careful
by standing away from the cliff.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.209
Let me, let me just give you
another practical example.

00:20:42.419 --> 00:20:46.830
This past week we were out in, uh, one
of the Great Lakes, lake Erie, and we

00:20:46.834 --> 00:20:51.090
were walking up to this lighthouse and
over to the left side we saw a snake.

00:20:51.689 --> 00:20:52.229
No big deal.

00:20:52.235 --> 00:20:54.419
Let's over here on the left
side, and we walked a little

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:55.800
further, we saw another snake.

00:20:56.475 --> 00:20:59.655
Which is okay cuz I kept walking a
little bit further the other direction.

00:20:59.685 --> 00:21:02.145
On our way back there
was a family of snakes.

00:21:02.655 --> 00:21:04.635
So if you don't know me, I hate snakes.

00:21:04.725 --> 00:21:05.805
I'm terrified of them.

00:21:06.165 --> 00:21:09.915
So guess what I carefully did,
walked really far away from them.

00:21:10.695 --> 00:21:13.815
I was careful to look where my feet
were going cuz I was afraid they were

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.255
gonna crawl out where my feet were.

00:21:15.285 --> 00:21:15.615
Okay.

00:21:15.945 --> 00:21:20.865
So whenever I think about being careful,
what that means is I'm highly intentional.

00:21:21.525 --> 00:21:22.815
I'm aware of my surroundings.

00:21:22.935 --> 00:21:25.485
I'm always thinking on.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.710
Amen.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.000
God's word.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.310
I'm always thinking on God's truths.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.730
It's always present in my mind,
and I'm thinking of situations

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.580
of how that I can follow Jesus.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.990
So he says, be careful to follow
these laws and precepts, and for

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.180
us, again, it's to follow Jesus.

00:21:42.855 --> 00:21:45.615
And when we look at this, he says
that so that you may prosper, and

00:21:45.615 --> 00:21:48.554
he begins to talk about this milk
and honey and this land, right?

00:21:48.554 --> 00:21:50.715
The, the land that they're
gonna go into is milk and honey.

00:21:50.715 --> 00:21:53.115
And that does not mean, not sound
great to you because you're lactose

00:21:53.115 --> 00:21:54.975
intolerant and you like sugar, not honey.

00:21:54.975 --> 00:21:56.385
And that doesn't mean anything to you.

00:21:56.445 --> 00:21:56.625
Okay?

00:21:56.629 --> 00:21:57.975
This is not really what
he's talking about.

00:21:57.975 --> 00:22:01.665
Milk and honey was, milk was just
a daily thing that he provided.

00:22:01.665 --> 00:22:05.145
So your daily pro things that
you need for your life, but

00:22:05.145 --> 00:22:06.314
honey was something special.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.940
And we think about this, what
does that look like for us?

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.780
Is so that we may prosper, prosper,
and be fruitful in our lives.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.940
And what that means is
what God has for us.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:20.880
And when I think of fruitful, I think
of the, uh, fruits of the spirit, that

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.980
when we follow, carefully follow the
Lord, we begin to experience joy and

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.630
peace and patience, and we begin to
experience the fruits that God has for us.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.870
And I would even say this,
that we begin to be successful

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:34.750
at the things that matter.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.600
Go back to this.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.570
What is the one thing that
should matter the most to you?

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.040
Raising a Godly family.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.930
So that they come to know the Lord.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:44.490
Here's the thing.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.170
They're gonna figure out
what job they're gonna get.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.260
They're gonna figure out, you
know, all these things about life.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:53.460
But if they know Jesus, Jesus will be the
one that guides them and directs them.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.140
So that is the most important thing.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:23:00.180
So as we follow carefully, we
will be successful in what we do.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.120
And then he goes into verse four and five.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.350
This is the part where we see.

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:10.200
The greatest commandment and
within, uh, the Jewish tradition

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.060
was they would call this the shamma.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.150
I don't typically use big words in
here, but it is something that if

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:18.600
you, anybody ever watch the chosen
series, okay, I'm the only one.

00:23:18.605 --> 00:23:21.900
A couple people, if you have watched
the chosen series, which is a great one,

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:22.860
there's a lot of good things in there.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.740
They actually repeat the,
they talk about the shaman.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.470
This is what they're repeating,
and, and this is what it says.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.320
It says, listen, Israel, the Lord are God.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.580
The Lord is one.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.820
Love the Lord your God with all
your heart, with all your soul,

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.780
and with all your strength.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:37.889
And most of us.

00:23:38.219 --> 00:23:43.020
If you were like me early on in my faith,
I didn't like reading the Old Testament.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:43.889
Just being honest.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.810
It didn't make a ton of sense to me.

00:23:46.379 --> 00:23:49.590
It makes a lot more sense now because
I've spent time in it and I've studied

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:54.929
it, but I actually heard this first
in the New Testament and Jesus was the

00:23:54.929 --> 00:23:58.560
one to give this command, and so he
was really just repeating this command

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.740
is to love the Lord your God, with all
your heart, mind, soul, and strength.

00:24:03.105 --> 00:24:06.975
And when we look at this, verse four,
the first thing, when we think about our

00:24:06.975 --> 00:24:08.745
personal relationships with Jesus, right?

00:24:08.955 --> 00:24:10.995
What does it mean to
personally follow Jesus?

00:24:11.415 --> 00:24:14.355
Is to personally follow him alone.

00:24:14.685 --> 00:24:15.765
That's what I see here.

00:24:15.915 --> 00:24:19.635
I see Moses speaking to the men
saying, Hey, you need to follow these

00:24:19.635 --> 00:24:24.495
things carefully, but then he says,
you need to follow the Lord as one.

00:24:25.185 --> 00:24:27.285
Now, why did he say one?

00:24:27.735 --> 00:24:31.365
I believe it's because we are
easily distracted with other.

00:24:31.725 --> 00:24:35.835
Little g gods or idols
in our lives as men.

00:24:35.835 --> 00:24:37.185
Lemme just gonna speak
to the men right now.

00:24:37.365 --> 00:24:43.965
Men, we seem to identify our
lives with our professions.

00:24:44.985 --> 00:24:47.625
And what we begin to do is
it becomes our identity.

00:24:48.165 --> 00:24:51.615
And then in our thoughts is, is,
you know, whenever our kids need

00:24:51.615 --> 00:24:55.215
something, well, I, I worked, don't
I, I provide food for you, don't I?

00:24:55.365 --> 00:24:57.195
I provide money to do your activities.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.365
Isn't that enough?

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.460
We begin to identify and make that
the most important things in our

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.350
lives as providers in our home.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:05.580
That's the most important thing.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:10.710
Truthfully, that's not the most
important thing, is to worship

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:14.190
God alone, the one true God alone.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.030
And I think it's easy for us to
get distracted by other things.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.470
And so here's just another one.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:22.200
If it's not our jobs, here's how
we can easily get distracted.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.530
It's just our personal fulfillment
and our own satisfaction.

00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:29.415
As fathers, we again begin, and I'm
speaking directly to fathers right now.

00:25:29.415 --> 00:25:34.005
This could be parents or anybody else,
but as fathers, we work all day and then

00:25:34.005 --> 00:25:36.375
we should be able to do something for
ourselves, which I'm not actually against.

00:25:36.375 --> 00:25:39.465
I think you should take some personal
time for yourself, but we begin to

00:25:39.465 --> 00:25:43.635
be so consumed by our extracurricular
activities, and we're so consumed

00:25:43.635 --> 00:25:46.785
by just providing for our families
that at the end of the day, we have

00:25:46.785 --> 00:25:50.385
nothing to give our kids, and all our
kids see is that we're more committed

00:25:50.385 --> 00:25:54.195
to our jobs, we're more committed to
our personal things that we enjoy.

00:25:54.705 --> 00:25:57.855
And we're modeling for them
what it means to follow Jesus.

00:25:57.915 --> 00:25:59.985
So here's, just imagine
what happens as a parent.

00:26:00.255 --> 00:26:01.665
You need to follow Jesus.

00:26:01.905 --> 00:26:04.275
You need to read your Bible, but they
don't ever see you read your Bible.

00:26:04.395 --> 00:26:06.015
They never see you
practically following Jesus.

00:26:06.015 --> 00:26:08.445
They see you treating
people like, you know what?

00:26:08.835 --> 00:26:10.545
You come to church, but
you really aren't engaged.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.345
You're probably scrolling,
scrolling social media while

00:26:12.345 --> 00:26:13.515
the pastor's up here talking.

00:26:13.935 --> 00:26:16.365
You know, you send 'em off to
class and you sometimes don't

00:26:16.365 --> 00:26:18.075
even come to the service.

00:26:18.615 --> 00:26:19.635
They're talking about their class.

00:26:19.635 --> 00:26:22.425
Anybody have their kids get in your car
and start talking about their class?

00:26:22.935 --> 00:26:23.385
Anybody?

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.270
Do you get in your car and start
talking to kids about what you hear in

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.939
service or are you talking about lunch?

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.090
I mean, I'm not, some of you probably
do, but many of us will just quickly

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:34.740
turn to, I've got work tomorrow.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:35.429
I've got a plan.

00:26:35.435 --> 00:26:37.080
I've gotta get so distracted by this.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.949
And the kids are sitting here going, but
aren't I supposed to follow Jesus as one?

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:44.879
And so he's, he makes this
statement, the Lord our God is one.

00:26:45.179 --> 00:26:49.980
Because the people of Israel
were known to add other things

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.659
into their life to be priority.

00:26:52.905 --> 00:26:54.225
We are just like them.

00:26:54.225 --> 00:26:54.465
Are we?

00:26:54.465 --> 00:26:57.044
Not every one of us are just like them.

00:26:57.044 --> 00:26:59.355
And so he uses that specifically, right?

00:26:59.355 --> 00:27:04.125
So maybe we need to remind ourselves
that we have one God that has

00:27:04.125 --> 00:27:08.235
redeemed us for a purpose, and
that should be our sole focus.

00:27:08.475 --> 00:27:09.284
Yes, we have a job.

00:27:09.284 --> 00:27:11.324
Yes, we have other extracurricular
activities, but what are

00:27:11.324 --> 00:27:12.585
we modeling to our kids?

00:27:13.034 --> 00:27:14.655
Number five or, uh, the verse five.

00:27:14.655 --> 00:27:17.715
It says this, he says the love,
the Lord your God with our, your

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.125
heart, mind, soul, and strength.

00:27:19.125 --> 00:27:19.395
Right?

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.980
I think I added mine to this one,
but that's in the New Testament.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.900
Really, this can be summarized for this.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.390
I'm not gonna spend a ton of time
on it just for the fact of, if you

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.000
begin to study this a little bit
deeper, and I wanna read this even

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.550
in the message version because
I think it helps us see this.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.100
In the message version, it
says this, it says, love God,

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.080
your God with your whole heart.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.910
Love him with all that's in you
love him with all you've got.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:47.070
Basically what this verse is saying,
you need to love God with everything.

00:27:47.655 --> 00:27:50.625
And, and if you name something,
well, what about this?

00:27:50.685 --> 00:27:51.765
God's like, yes.

00:27:51.855 --> 00:27:52.545
Well, what about that?

00:27:52.545 --> 00:27:53.265
Yes.

00:27:53.445 --> 00:27:54.165
Well, what about that?

00:27:54.165 --> 00:27:59.955
Yes, your time, your money,
your talents, your, you name it.

00:28:00.165 --> 00:28:02.715
Love God with everything you have.

00:28:02.925 --> 00:28:04.305
With everything you have.

00:28:04.785 --> 00:28:09.885
So as fathers, we model what loving
and following Jesus truly is.

00:28:09.885 --> 00:28:13.965
As parents, as aspiring parents,
we will model to our kids what

00:28:13.965 --> 00:28:15.915
is most important in our lives.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.170
So it starts with us
following Jesus first.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.350
If we wanna make the greatest
impact in our kids' lives, it starts

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:23.820
with us following Jesus first.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:29.940
Then what's the second thing
to prioritize as a family, to

00:28:29.945 --> 00:28:31.230
teach our kids to follow Jesus.

00:28:32.564 --> 00:28:34.455
We've been talking about modeling
and all those things, but we need to

00:28:34.455 --> 00:28:37.635
teach, and this is where we'll continue
to see how Moses points this out.

00:28:37.635 --> 00:28:40.544
He says, to love the God
personally, love God personally.

00:28:40.574 --> 00:28:42.254
Do that, yes, love God personally.

00:28:42.705 --> 00:28:45.524
And then he says this in verse
six, these words that I am giving

00:28:45.524 --> 00:28:47.235
you today are to be in your heart.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.470
And then he says to repeat
them to your children.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.980
Talk about them when they sit, when
you sit in your homes and walk around

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.399
on the road and when you lie down and
when you get up, and when you bind

00:28:56.405 --> 00:28:59.310
them as a sign on your hand and let
them be a symbol on your forehead

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:02.820
and write them on the doorposts of
your house and in your city gates.

00:29:03.899 --> 00:29:08.970
See, dad's, I, I would just say this,
and even parents, I think at times we

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:12.990
think, well, I'm modeling it right?

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:14.430
I, I don't have to teach them.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:15.930
I can just live.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:20.159
I can just live and then hopefully they're
just gonna catch everything that I'm

00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:21.570
doing and they're just gonna repeat it.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.360
Well, we did see that little kid
did that right in that story.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.920
But at times they're gonna start
questioning, well, dad, why

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.860
are you reacting that way, dad?

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.030
Why do you do that?

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:37.470
And are you just gonna tell 'em just
because are you gonna actually teach them?

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:41.790
And so when we think about this, we have
to teach our kids, and it starts by.

00:29:43.065 --> 00:29:46.155
Everything that we have learned from
the Lord has to be on our hearts.

00:29:46.155 --> 00:29:47.625
And I, I wanna translate it this way.

00:29:48.345 --> 00:29:49.965
It has to be on the tip of our tongue.

00:29:50.325 --> 00:29:51.105
What does that mean?

00:29:51.285 --> 00:29:55.785
That we know it so well, that we
don't have to even think before

00:29:55.785 --> 00:29:57.225
we start teaching our kids.

00:29:57.225 --> 00:30:01.395
It's something that we naturally do
in the natural overflow of our life.

00:30:01.755 --> 00:30:04.365
So why should it be on our hearts?

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.190
Because verse seven tells us that we
need to repeat them to our children.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.220
And the only things that I repeat to my
children are things that I know really

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.550
well, cuz it's not gonna be the things
I don't know well, does that make sense?

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.620
It's only gonna be the things I know well.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.830
So we'll only be able to repeat
these things in which we know well.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:23.340
But I think it's important, and this
is one of the keys to parenting,

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:25.020
sometimes we're exhausted.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.680
Anybody get exhausted in parenting,
it just, we get exhausted.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.370
So what do we wanna do?

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.080
Do it because I said so.

00:30:32.475 --> 00:30:35.385
Well, right here, when he says
to repeat what he's saying is

00:30:35.385 --> 00:30:36.795
don't shove it down their throats.

00:30:37.095 --> 00:30:38.955
You need to do this, this, this, and this.

00:30:38.955 --> 00:30:39.795
You need to follow Jesus.

00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:40.755
You need to be in the Word.

00:30:40.935 --> 00:30:41.895
You just need to do it.

00:30:42.585 --> 00:30:44.685
You think that's gonna encourage
your kids to go love the Lord?

00:30:45.825 --> 00:30:46.275
No.

00:30:46.725 --> 00:30:47.415
Just something else.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.685
And I know we don't have physical
Bibles as much anymore, but please

00:30:51.045 --> 00:30:54.525
don't take your Bible and slap your
kid across the head and say, Just get

00:30:54.525 --> 00:30:56.385
the word in you like, I'm serious.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:57.555
Like we can't just bash.

00:30:57.555 --> 00:31:00.975
And that's figuratively, figuratively
and literally we don't need to bash

00:31:00.975 --> 00:31:04.365
the word of God over our children's
heads to convince them to follow Jesus.

00:31:04.995 --> 00:31:06.195
We need to teach them.

00:31:06.885 --> 00:31:09.525
And when, when it comes to teaching,
think about teaching them the way that you

00:31:09.525 --> 00:31:11.715
wanna be taught in a very lovingly way.

00:31:11.715 --> 00:31:13.755
Because at first it's hard.

00:31:14.235 --> 00:31:16.815
We don't know everything, and
we're confused and, and there's

00:31:16.815 --> 00:31:18.105
a lot of things that go into it.

00:31:18.105 --> 00:31:19.335
And so we need to teach them.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.860
And then we need to model it by
the practical way in which we live

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:23.939
every day, and that's where he talk.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.449
He says this.

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:28.350
He says, talk about it when you sit in
your house and when you lie down and when

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.870
you get up, when you walk along the road.

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.570
Don't just talk at your kids.

00:31:34.139 --> 00:31:34.949
Talk with your kids.

00:31:34.949 --> 00:31:36.300
They're a lot smarter than you think.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:37.350
I would say this.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.909
Start asking a ton of questions.

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.459
That's one of the favorite
ways I love engaging my kids.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.020
I just ask 'em questions.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:44.459
I just did it the other day.

00:31:44.459 --> 00:31:46.830
In the middle of this message I was
writing, I actually asked Peyton.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:47.370
I said, Hey.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.169
Am I a good father?

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.179
And she says, of course she's
gonna say, yeah, because she

00:31:51.179 --> 00:31:51.840
doesn't wanna say anything.

00:31:52.139 --> 00:31:52.649
Why?

00:31:53.729 --> 00:31:55.469
Of course, she starts stumbling
over herself a little bit and she

00:31:55.475 --> 00:31:58.590
begins to give me some examples
and, and I asked that question and

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.610
I said, Hey, just be real with me.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.290
You can actually say some
negative things with me.

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:01.830
I need to hear this.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:02.729
And you know what she told me?

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:05.580
She says, I don't like whenever
you shut us down, whenever we're

00:32:05.584 --> 00:32:06.659
really trying to explain ourselves.

00:32:06.659 --> 00:32:07.860
I'm like, that's good feedback.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:10.350
Like I need to know that rather
than just telling her to sit

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:14.550
down, shut up and listen to what
I say, I truly want to teach her.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.530
And I wanna talk with her.

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:20.460
And so we understand this
talking parents goes both ways.

00:32:21.689 --> 00:32:23.460
And I'll just extend this to marriage.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:26.399
Hey, marriage, if you're married
in this room, talking goes both

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:28.439
ways and listening does too.

00:32:29.699 --> 00:32:32.490
I don't like that, but
I just like telling.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:35.730
Yes, thanks Orville.

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:37.409
I'm not the only one.

00:32:38.355 --> 00:32:41.024
What I love about this is he says, not
only when you walk, but when you sleep

00:32:41.024 --> 00:32:44.205
at night, when you wake up, you know what
my number one routine as a father has

00:32:44.205 --> 00:32:50.955
been ever since our kids have been born
nighttime prayer for the last 14 years.

00:32:50.955 --> 00:32:52.425
I've done nighttime prayer with my kids.

00:32:52.425 --> 00:32:54.675
It's not, and occasionally
Brittany will do it whenever

00:32:54.675 --> 00:32:57.284
I'm just busy 99% of the time.

00:32:57.629 --> 00:33:01.200
I'm walking in, we gather up,
we take turns, we make it fun.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.850
Channing has Sundays.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:03.990
Tegan has Mondays.

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:05.129
Peyton has Tuesdays.

00:33:05.129 --> 00:33:07.560
Sterling finally has Thursdays.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.430
I have Wednesdays.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:11.040
We do rock paper, scissors
on Fridays and Saturdays.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.750
We make it fun and we talk about things
that need to be prayed for and we pray

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:19.379
together and, and I look at that as
we didn't make it this real religious

00:33:19.385 --> 00:33:20.520
thing that we're forcing them to do.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.010
It is something that we enjoy to do.

00:33:23.565 --> 00:33:27.285
We do it in the mornings when
we pray for breakfast, we talk

00:33:27.285 --> 00:33:28.095
about it throughout the day.

00:33:28.095 --> 00:33:29.115
Why do we do that?

00:33:29.115 --> 00:33:36.015
Because what we believe the most is
what we'll talk about the most, what we

00:33:36.015 --> 00:33:39.315
enjoy the most, what impacts our life
the most is what we'll do the most.

00:33:39.705 --> 00:33:44.775
And so our kids see us do things and
prioritize things that may not seem

00:33:44.775 --> 00:33:47.085
exciting at the time, but the impact.

00:33:47.805 --> 00:33:48.615
Tremendous.

00:33:48.645 --> 00:33:51.945
And that's why he says to talk
about it and to walk and to do it.

00:33:52.245 --> 00:33:54.555
And so we do this because it
influences our children's lives

00:33:54.555 --> 00:33:56.715
to do what model after us.

00:33:56.715 --> 00:34:01.395
This is when we begin to see our kids
start to have it on their hearts so that

00:34:01.395 --> 00:34:06.555
they can begin to walk and talk about
the truths of the of God's word and

00:34:06.705 --> 00:34:10.304
to sit in the house and begin to have
discussions about who Jesus is and to

00:34:10.545 --> 00:34:14.835
to begin to go to school and to invite
their friends to church and share Jesus

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.485
with their friends and to begin to.

00:34:17.759 --> 00:34:20.759
Pray at night without their parents
when they're not around and begin

00:34:20.759 --> 00:34:23.100
to wake up and begin to pray
with the Lord throughout the day.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:27.089
We set the standard as
parents, as fathers.

00:34:27.405 --> 00:34:29.085
How to follow Jesus.

00:34:29.085 --> 00:34:30.165
But we have to teach them.

00:34:30.165 --> 00:34:31.784
We can't just expect the church to do it.

00:34:31.784 --> 00:34:35.175
We can't just expect them to
figure it out on their own.

00:34:35.745 --> 00:34:37.395
And I love what he says.

00:34:37.574 --> 00:34:41.355
Moses is going back to the father,
the leader, the parents in the home.

00:34:41.355 --> 00:34:42.465
And he says this in verse eight.

00:34:42.525 --> 00:34:45.945
He says, bind them as a sign
on your head hand and let them

00:34:45.945 --> 00:34:47.415
be a symbol on your forehead.

00:34:47.715 --> 00:34:48.585
Crazy enough.

00:34:50.145 --> 00:34:52.905
Again, even you'll see this if
you go to Israel today, Jews

00:34:52.905 --> 00:34:54.855
will actually bind the scripture.

00:34:54.855 --> 00:34:57.975
They write scripture and they bind
it on their left hand, and they'll

00:34:57.975 --> 00:35:00.855
actually put this band around their
forehead with scripture on there.

00:35:01.035 --> 00:35:03.735
They're putting it on their forehead
and they're putting it on their arm.

00:35:03.915 --> 00:35:07.815
And then you'll begin to see that they
write this scripture on their doorpost.

00:35:07.845 --> 00:35:09.945
And if they're religious and
spiritual enough, they write it

00:35:09.945 --> 00:35:11.715
on every doorpost in their house.

00:35:12.255 --> 00:35:15.465
You know, they always wanna make sure
that they're remembering the word

00:35:15.465 --> 00:35:19.785
of God and that their kids see it,
and that their kids see two things.

00:35:19.815 --> 00:35:20.355
I wanna tell you this.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.635
Number one, it's around our arms.

00:35:22.785 --> 00:35:25.695
Why does he say to put it around
our hands or around our arms?

00:35:25.995 --> 00:35:28.485
Because it's something
that we actively do.

00:35:28.485 --> 00:35:31.515
We don't just read scripture,
we don't just have knowledge,

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.765
but we're action based.

00:35:32.785 --> 00:35:35.625
So when we think about our
arms, it's reminding us to be

00:35:35.625 --> 00:35:37.875
actively living out our faith.

00:35:38.279 --> 00:35:41.129
Modeling for our kids, but when
we have it on our foreheads, it

00:35:41.129 --> 00:35:44.069
says, we're not ashamed, because
I'll just tell you that's goofy.

00:35:45.419 --> 00:35:47.939
I mean, just imagine if you rode
John three 16 in your forehead.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:52.589
It's gonna be a little goofy, but
it's publicly displaying your faith.

00:35:53.189 --> 00:35:55.799
See, parents, I, I just, I'm gonna
be straight up honest with you.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.600
Here's what will happen.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.470
The, the most spiritual time you'll
see, your kids will see you is on

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:05.640
Sunday morning, Monday through Saturday.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.740
They don't see godly parents.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.330
They don't see you pray.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.850
They don't see you in the word,
they don't see you talk to,

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.800
to, to, to them about Jesus.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.710
And, and then they, they're
like, something's off here.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.180
Well, what do we need to do?

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:21.930
We need to bind them on
our arm and live them out.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.340
We need to put them on our forehead.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:28.950
We need to be unashamedly disgusting
our faith, not only with our kids, but

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:31.140
letting them see you talk to other people.

00:36:32.025 --> 00:36:33.375
Modeling who Jesus is.

00:36:33.375 --> 00:36:36.075
One of my favorite things to do, and it's
something that I've challenged myself

00:36:36.075 --> 00:36:38.295
to do when I make a mistake as a father.

00:36:38.925 --> 00:36:40.035
Don't just pass it off.

00:36:40.275 --> 00:36:42.555
Sit down with your kids
and say, I made a mistake.

00:36:43.335 --> 00:36:44.085
I'm sorry.

00:36:44.085 --> 00:36:45.045
Will you forgive me?

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.750
I'm modeling humility to my kids.

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:48.750
Am I perfect?

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.920
Absolutely not.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:51.600
Just ask my kids, they'll tell you.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:54.180
But those are things that teach them.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:55.380
Jesus forgave me.

00:36:55.385 --> 00:36:56.130
That's usually what I tell 'em.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:56.910
Jesus forgave me.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:00.930
I ask God to forgive me for what I just
did, or what I said, or how I acted.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.340
Will you forgive me?

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:06.360
And it's modeling to them who Jesus is.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:10.740
So when we look at this text
today, I believe Moses is not just

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.910
preparing the next generation to not
follow after their parents' path.

00:37:16.424 --> 00:37:20.835
But he's preparing all generations to not
follow after the previous generations.

00:37:20.895 --> 00:37:22.725
Who have forgotten God.

00:37:23.565 --> 00:37:24.645
Who have forgotten God.

00:37:26.415 --> 00:37:31.755
So we remind ourselves the importance
of being the example for our kids

00:37:31.904 --> 00:37:37.424
to be example, not only in how
we follow Jesus, but in how we

00:37:37.605 --> 00:37:39.884
teach our kids to follow Jesus.

00:37:40.185 --> 00:37:43.125
Here's the thing, as parents, I'm just
telling you, I'm that same parent.

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:45.840
I want my kids to be
successful at education.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.220
I want my kids to be successful at their
sports and all kinds of other things.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.850
But if I talk about those things
way more than Jesus, guess what?

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:58.410
They'll start prioritizing more, wanting
to be successful at education and

00:37:58.415 --> 00:38:01.380
sports more than following after Jesus.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.310
It's okay to talk about those things,
but it's so much more important

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.070
to teach them to follow Jesus.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.460
So I want us to think through
this as we have invitation today.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.090
Number one, that we set the
example, and Moses is reminding

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.010
us, he's speaking directly to us.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:19.740
And here's the thing that I, I
want everybody to understand this.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.990
There's no guarantee that
your kids will follow Jesus.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:25.590
We can't make that decision for
them, but we can set them off in the

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.120
right foot, in the right direction.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.830
And this is something, again,
God's word is, is so clear.

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:34.710
When we look at two
scriptures and we think about.

00:38:35.399 --> 00:38:37.169
What has happened in the
past to these people?

00:38:37.169 --> 00:38:40.350
So Deuteronomy six, they're
not in the promised land yet.

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:42.359
They're getting ready to
go into the Promised Land.

00:38:42.359 --> 00:38:44.819
Joshua's actually gonna be the one
that leads into the promised land.

00:38:45.029 --> 00:38:47.129
They go in, they conquer all this land.

00:38:47.339 --> 00:38:50.009
Joshua gathers them towards
the end of his life, and here's

00:38:50.009 --> 00:38:51.959
what he says in Joshua 24 15.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:57.089
He's speaking to the same people, he
says, but if serving the Lord seems

00:38:57.089 --> 00:39:01.589
undesirable to you, then choose for
yourselves this day whom you will serve.

00:39:02.475 --> 00:39:06.825
Whether the gods of your ancestors served
beyond the Euphrates or the gods of the

00:39:06.825 --> 00:39:08.775
Amorites, or in whose land you are living.

00:39:09.735 --> 00:39:15.465
But as for me and my household,
we will serve the Lord today.

00:39:15.615 --> 00:39:19.515
You truly need to ask this question, and
I I'm, I'm challenging you with this.

00:39:21.015 --> 00:39:27.495
Have you chose to serve the Lord or
are you choosing to serve the little

00:39:27.495 --> 00:39:29.895
g gods, the idols in your life?

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:36.780
I mean, that's a true question is
what is more important to you, Jesus,

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:44.010
or your job or your activities or
everything else is that more important?

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:44.850
So choose today.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.170
That's what Joshua's challenged us to do.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:47.760
Choose today whom you will serve.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:53.250
Are we committed to modeling for
our kids how to follow Jesus?

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:54.300
Are we following Jesus?

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.980
Are we teaching them?

00:39:55.985 --> 00:39:58.740
And, and so, you know, I just
wanna really quickly stop if

00:39:58.740 --> 00:39:59.550
you're struggling with that.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.080
I would love to walk alongside you,
not because I'm perfect, but because

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.259
I want to walk alongside anybody
that wants to desire to do this.

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:13.259
But what I want to challenge you with
is, do you know that the people of Joshua

00:40:13.265 --> 00:40:16.590
responded and said, you're right, Joshua.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:17.910
We don't wanna serve those other gods.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:19.680
We wanna serve the one true God.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.850
And you know what?

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:25.529
That generation did, that generation
served the Lord their whole lives.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.290
But let's pick up in
judges two 10 through 12.

00:40:29.025 --> 00:40:33.435
It says this, after the whole generation
had been gathered to their ancestors,

00:40:33.435 --> 00:40:37.695
which means now that next generation that
Moses was speaking to that Josh would

00:40:37.695 --> 00:40:42.525
just got done speaking to it says after
they'd been gathered to their ancestors.

00:40:42.525 --> 00:40:47.625
Another generation grew up who
knew neither the Lord knew nor

00:40:47.625 --> 00:40:48.915
what he had done for Israel.

00:40:49.545 --> 00:40:52.365
And then the Israelites did what
was evil on the side of the Lord and

00:40:52.365 --> 00:40:55.904
served the Baals, and they forsook the
Lord and the God of their ancestors

00:40:55.904 --> 00:40:57.315
who brought them out of Egypt.

00:40:57.525 --> 00:41:00.675
They followed and worshiped various
gods of peoples around them.

00:41:01.365 --> 00:41:02.025
Here's the thing.

00:41:03.735 --> 00:41:05.654
They got half of the everything
we talked about, right?

00:41:06.105 --> 00:41:10.965
They followed God all the days
of their lives, but they forgot

00:41:10.965 --> 00:41:12.165
to teach their next generation.

00:41:12.465 --> 00:41:13.305
They forgot to teach the kids.

00:41:15.674 --> 00:41:16.634
I don't wanna do that.

00:41:18.205 --> 00:41:22.035
I, I don't wanna follow Jesus
wholeheartedly and leave my kids

00:41:22.035 --> 00:41:25.125
to figure it out on their own and
turn into the next generation.

00:41:25.125 --> 00:41:28.484
That did not, and this is so
crazy, who knew neither the

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:29.714
Lord nor what he had done.

00:41:29.714 --> 00:41:32.805
They did not talk when they were
walking down the road about what God

00:41:32.845 --> 00:41:34.995
had done for them in Egypt and how
they get in the problem promised land.

00:41:35.355 --> 00:41:37.125
They did not talk in the evenings.

00:41:37.125 --> 00:41:38.505
They did not talk in the mornings.

00:41:38.625 --> 00:41:40.845
They didn't write it on their
door post and talk about why

00:41:40.845 --> 00:41:41.685
they wrote on their door post.

00:41:41.835 --> 00:41:45.674
They just religiously followed
after God and just hoped the

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.384
best and it didn't work out.

00:41:48.464 --> 00:41:52.845
This may be some heavy stuff for
you on Father's Day, but to me this

00:41:52.845 --> 00:41:55.575
is an encouraging thing because
we had the opportunity to change.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.995
Now, for those of you who aren't
parents or fathers, it's a challenge

00:41:58.995 --> 00:42:02.654
for you to start now and following
Jesus so that when you have kids,

00:42:02.835 --> 00:42:04.005
you'll be ready to teach them.

00:42:04.799 --> 00:42:08.669
For some of you, you already have kids
or grandkids you can choose today whom

00:42:08.669 --> 00:42:12.600
you will serve and recommit yourself
to the Lord and prepare yourself to

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.250
start going home and teaching your kids.

00:42:14.399 --> 00:42:17.310
And if you don't know how to
teach them and you need help ask.

00:42:17.759 --> 00:42:18.509
It's why we're at church.

00:42:18.509 --> 00:42:19.259
It's why we're here.

00:42:19.979 --> 00:42:22.169
We work together to help one another.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:24.240
Amen.

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:28.140
So let's pray and then I
just wanna lead you guys.

00:42:28.515 --> 00:42:30.585
To pray specifically for this thing.

00:42:30.585 --> 00:42:32.475
So, Lord Jesus, we thank
you so much for today.

00:42:32.475 --> 00:42:36.255
We thank you for your word and how it's
truth and how it's timeless because

00:42:36.435 --> 00:42:41.835
even though Moses was speaking to the
people of Israel, it's so crazy, Lord,

00:42:41.835 --> 00:42:44.205
how he's speaking directly to us today.

00:42:44.445 --> 00:42:50.145
Because we at times are placing
other things as a priority

00:42:50.145 --> 00:42:51.165
in our life and not you.

00:42:52.125 --> 00:42:54.855
We may follow Jesus, but we
are not following him hard

00:42:54.855 --> 00:42:56.295
heartedly and maybe today.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.470
We need to surrender back to you.

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:05.070
Maybe we are following after Jesus,
but we are not teaching our kids.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.750
Maybe we sit in this room and we wonder
if we'll ever have kids, and maybe

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:13.860
you just need to remind us today,
Lord, that we can begin to prepare

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:15.420
no matter what happens in the future.

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:21.510
God, you are good and we are so thankful
for your word to remind us of that.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.640
So as we continue to pray,
here's what I love, being able

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.810
to lead you through Invitation.

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:31.530
Invitation is an opportunity to consider
what we have learned today and how we

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:33.780
begin to now ask the Lord to guide us.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.990
And the first part that I really wanna
lead you through today, I want you to

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.990
just take some time to evaluate your
personal relationship with Jesus.

00:43:41.055 --> 00:43:43.875
If you have a personal relationship with
Jesus, I want you to evaluate whether

00:43:43.875 --> 00:43:47.565
you are truly following Jesus or maybe
you've just fallen away and you begin

00:43:47.565 --> 00:43:49.605
to serve other idols or other gods.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.015
You've been placing other priorities.

00:43:51.015 --> 00:43:54.435
And if that's you, I want you to
spend some time in repentance and

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:59.055
ask in the Lord to prioritize being
a godly parent, future parent.

00:43:59.355 --> 00:44:03.195
If there's kids in this room to
be a Godly child to your parents.

00:44:04.005 --> 00:44:09.795
Just begin to pray right now and take
some time to say, God, help me follow you.

00:44:10.305 --> 00:44:12.765
And place you first, the
one true God in your life.

00:44:12.765 --> 00:44:14.865
So we'll take just a minute
to pray for that specifically.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:54.650
All right.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:58.950
The next thing that I want to encourage
you to pray for is if you've committed

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.550
back to just following Jesus the way
that he has called you to follow.

00:45:03.435 --> 00:45:06.285
Now is how can you help your kids?

00:45:06.825 --> 00:45:10.005
And some of you may be clueless
right now on how to teach

00:45:10.005 --> 00:45:12.135
your kids or your grandkids.

00:45:12.885 --> 00:45:16.065
I want you to pray right now for God
to give you wisdom how to do that for

00:45:16.065 --> 00:45:22.425
God, to give you a passion to teach your
kids who he is by walking with them and

00:45:22.425 --> 00:45:26.565
talking with them, and writing on the
doorpost and being public with your faith.

00:45:27.225 --> 00:45:28.185
Ask God right now.

00:45:28.185 --> 00:45:30.225
Spend some time and ask God, God help me.

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:33.810
Know how to do that either now or
in the future when you have kids.

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:38.370
Ask God to help you know how
to teach the next generation.

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:39.689
So let's take some time to pray for that.

00:46:25.845 --> 00:46:30.975
Lord Jesus, we are so thankful, Lord for
you, and we're so thankful for just your

00:46:30.975 --> 00:46:35.805
spirit and so thankful that you forgive
us and that you consistently pursue us.

00:46:37.065 --> 00:46:41.805
Lord, I'm reminded that your
word is a lamp unto our feet.

00:46:43.695 --> 00:46:49.335
Lord, it is there to guide us in our
walks with you and to remind us when

00:46:49.335 --> 00:46:53.115
we've steered off in the wrong path,
when we haven't been prioritizing you

00:46:53.295 --> 00:46:54.615
and we've been placing other things.

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.830
Above you.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.700
So Lord, thank you for some time
today for each one of us, Lord, to

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:05.640
ask you to come into our lives and to
help us place you in the right place.

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:11.040
Lord, I'm also thankful that you are
the one that gives us truths in your

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.140
word to begin to teach our children in.

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:16.800
The only way that we'll be able to teach
our children is if we know those truths.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.230
So, Lord, I'm praying for just.

00:47:19.815 --> 00:47:23.145
Passion in each one of our hearts,
Lord, to go out and to know you more.

00:47:23.355 --> 00:47:29.055
And then as we know you more, we begin to
teach or talk about that with our kids.

00:47:29.325 --> 00:47:32.475
We begin to discuss your word
and read your word together and

00:47:32.475 --> 00:47:35.654
pray together and model what it
looks like to follow after you.

00:47:35.685 --> 00:47:39.884
Not in perfection, Lord, but even in
the brokenness when we make mistakes.

00:47:39.884 --> 00:47:43.395
Lord, I pray that you allow us
to model that to our kids, how

00:47:43.395 --> 00:47:44.685
we can receive forgiveness.

00:47:45.975 --> 00:47:48.765
God, I pray that if there's anybody
in this room that doesn't know you.

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:52.200
That they don't have that personal
relationship with you, Lord.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:56.130
And so, and because they don't have
that, they can't teach their kids

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.760
how to know you and Lord, they're
just wondering if today is a day that

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.720
they need to give their lives to you.

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.380
Lord, I just pray that you give them
peace that today they can give their

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:08.730
lives to you through repenting of
their sins and saying yes to you and

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:14.400
asking for you to come into their
lives or give them the, the strength

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.140
to do that, to surrender that today.

00:48:18.254 --> 00:48:20.685
Lord, don't leave us unchanged.

00:48:20.685 --> 00:48:26.025
Lord, challenge us today to go
out and be better parents, future

00:48:26.025 --> 00:48:31.634
parents, grandparents, so that our
kids may come to know you and we

00:48:31.634 --> 00:48:32.595
just pray this in your heavenly name.

00:48:33.105 --> 00:48:33.464
Amen.

00:48:33.765 --> 00:48:35.685
Let's stand and let's worship together.
