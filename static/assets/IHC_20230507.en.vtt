00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:07.275
All right.

00:01:08.445 --> 00:01:11.635
Well, I am super excited
to be back here this week.

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:14.715
And excited to see everybody here.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:21.665
And so we have recently  started a series
a couple weeks ago  called Shalom Shalom

00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:25.875
which if you begin to study a little bit
about Shalom, Shalom, it's perfect peace.

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:28.155
So we've been talking about
God's perfect peace in the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.965
midst of our mental struggles.

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:36.735
We've learned that as we begin to just
look in society and as we realize as well

00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:41.475
just in our world as a church  that people
are struggling, including myself with.

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:45.635
These mental struggles of anxiety,
depression, burnout, worry, you name it.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:49.925
And so whenever we begin to just pray and
seek the Lord on some se sermon series

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:54.455
that we could begin to preach on and, and
talk about  this is one that came up and

00:01:54.455 --> 00:01:56.005
I could not get it off my heart and mind.

00:01:56.845 --> 00:02:01.695
And  as, as that came to the, the point
I just realized, okay, then that must be

00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:03.164
the reason why we need to talk about it.

00:02:03.464 --> 00:02:06.675
And so that's really what I, I'm saying
throughout this whole series is, okay,

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:10.245
if it is an issue in our community,
in our society, in our church, in our

00:02:10.245 --> 00:02:12.475
lives, then why not talk about it?

00:02:12.804 --> 00:02:16.334
And so that's what we're doing
in this series and we'll be

00:02:16.334 --> 00:02:17.665
continuing to do it in this series.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:18.935
but.

00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:22.150
Just so you guys know, as this, as
I'm continuing to, to speak to this

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.950
from a spiritual standpoint  I'll
continue to encourage you  to, to seek.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.900
Outside council and the fact of, we do
have a holistic effort of addressing our

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.990
mental issues from anxiety to stress, to,
to  burnout, to depression, and that we

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.390
can invite professionals in to help us.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.940
And so I don't ever wanna say
that  if you just give it to God,

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:45.990
it's the only way you can do it.

00:02:45.995 --> 00:02:50.430
I believe God's created people in our
community that are gifted in helping

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.450
walk through these things as well.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.100
And so we should not neglect that as well.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.900
So I'll give the spiritual standpoint.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.739
but I'm also going to encourage you to
seek professional help as well with this.

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.579
I was talking to one of our church members
this past week and just encouraging

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.070
them about, you know, the series and
talking to 'em a little bit about it and

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.060
they said, Hey, thank you so much for
being so honest about your struggles.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.869
And I said, Hey, thanks.

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:13.641
You know, somebody's,
somebody's gotta start it.

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:17.030
And that's the way I've looked at it
as whenever I'm sharing with you today.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.890
and what I'm continuing to share
with you in our series is  if,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.880
if, if we're going to get real.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.869
About life.

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:27.089
And this is what I say, not only our
mental struggles, but just how we're

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:28.530
dealing with our struggles in life.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.720
If we're gonna get real, it
needs to start somewhere.

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:32.459
And I believe it starts with leadership.

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.019
and I believe it starts here.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.190
And so as I share, I share not for
my benefit, but hopefully for your

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.190
benefit to know that you're not
alone or your friends that have deal

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.950
with these things are not alone.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.920
Whatever you struggle with,
that you're not alone.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.060
And this is a safe place.

00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:50.655
A safe place to be real, to seek the
Lord and to be broken, but then to

00:03:50.655 --> 00:03:55.405
know that the Lord is present in the
midst of  what we're walking through.

00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:59.114
and so today we're gonna be
discussing two truths to remember

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:00.755
when we battle depression.

00:04:01.135 --> 00:04:04.475
and so you kind of know depression
is a common and yet serious medical

00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:08.894
condition that negatively affects
how you feel, the way you think.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.900
And how you act.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.810
and when we think about depression, it
causes feelings of sadness and or loss of

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.880
interest and activities you once enjoyed.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.329
It can lead to a variety of emotional
and physical problems that can

00:04:20.334 --> 00:04:24.770
decrease your ability to function
even at work or possibly at home.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.340
And here's what I know.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.400
If you're sitting in this room, and this
is the group I wanna talk to real quick.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.420
If you're sitting in this room
and you're going, but what if

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.620
I don't deal with depression?

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.200
How does this sermon series apply to me?

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.920
Number one.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.645
depression does not discriminate.

00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:40.095
And what I mean by that is just
because you don't have it now

00:04:40.095 --> 00:04:41.415
means you won't deal with it later.

00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:43.695
So this is something you can stick in
your pocket and go, I can learn something

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.775
from this if I've never dealt with it.

00:04:44.775 --> 00:04:47.955
Number two, you probably have a
friend or a family member that

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:49.185
has walked through depression.

00:04:49.845 --> 00:04:55.125
This will be valuable for you to counsel
them, to listen to them and be a friend.

00:04:56.055 --> 00:04:59.145
I, I'm, and so that's the group I wanna
talk to because I think it'd be easy

00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:00.405
for a message series like this to go.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.070
Well, what if I don't struggle with it?

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.670
Well, I'm hoping that you can
take something home from it.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.480
So I've had people say this
before, whenever I have struggled

00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:12.960
with depression or anxiety
is  you just need to get over it.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.250
You just need to suck it up.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.179
you know, you just need to get better.

00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:18.290
you should just pray harder.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.440
There was somebody that I was talking to
you the other day  it was actually my aunt

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.920
who's actually dying from cancer and she
has a great perspective at life right now.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.850
She's dying from cancer and she said,
I've actually had some hurtful Christians.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.480
Come up to me and said, you know,
if you wanted to be healed, you're

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.470
just not praying hard enough.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.670
You don't have enough faith.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.010
And she said, you know, that hurts.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.500
She's like, but I'm praying.

00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:43.200
And God's choosing to
do something different.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.950
And she said, you know what?

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.570
He's doing something different.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.909
He's allowing me to impact people's lives.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.719
So what I would say with that is at
times we don't have those good Christian

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:52.950
friends that say the right things.

00:05:52.955 --> 00:05:54.979
And you know what you do,
you should give them grace.

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.060
because we, they don't understand.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:57.299
Right?

00:05:57.359 --> 00:06:01.120
And I would say this, whenever somebody
says, just suck it up or get better.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.659
I'll, I'll just give you
from personal experience.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.690
We wish we could, I'll say that again.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.159
We wish we could.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.030
I remember sitting down with my wife a
couple of years ago when I was wrestling

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.030
with depression and she just didn't
quite understand it and I love my wife,

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.969
and so we finally decided to sit down
and I had to begin to explain to her

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.719
that I didn't know how to overcome this.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.125
And as we begin to talk, there was
freedom in, in inviting her into the

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:29.865
process of what I was walking through.

00:06:29.985 --> 00:06:33.015
And she has been one of the greatest
supporters in the midst of the things

00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:37.665
that I've dealt with  because now she
understands what I'm walking through.

00:06:38.155 --> 00:06:40.095
and I'm so thankful for that.

00:06:40.155 --> 00:06:43.905
And so, Again, it's hard to
share and be open when we worry

00:06:43.905 --> 00:06:46.245
about what people will say to us.

00:06:46.275 --> 00:06:48.735
You know, it's interesting in our
world where we'll say if somebody

00:06:48.735 --> 00:06:50.025
has a sore throat, go to the doctor.

00:06:50.025 --> 00:06:51.735
You have a broken foot, go, go get it.

00:06:51.735 --> 00:06:53.775
You know, set and, and put a cast on it.

00:06:53.775 --> 00:06:56.995
But when we have depression, it's like,
ah, you should disfigure that out.

00:06:57.695 --> 00:06:59.955
and again, I think we're
getting better as a society.

00:06:59.955 --> 00:07:02.955
We're getting better as a
church  to say, Hey, we need

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.375
to seek counsel and seek help.

00:07:04.935 --> 00:07:07.095
and so as we've struggled.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.700
As I personally struggle through this,
I've been the one that's typically been

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.320
the one that says I need to get over it.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.820
Usually I'm my own worst enemy.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.150
but I wanna share with you this before
we kind of really jump in, is finally,

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.469
I came to a point in my walk with
depression a couple of years ago where

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:26.425
it was like, if I don't do something
about this, Something's gonna end wrong.

00:07:26.745 --> 00:07:30.284
And I just had to come to the conclusion
that I needed help, and I would think

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:34.034
that was the hardest thing when it comes
to mental health, is to actually make

00:07:34.034 --> 00:07:36.705
the statement out loud to somebody else.

00:07:36.974 --> 00:07:37.455
I need help.

00:07:38.015 --> 00:07:38.490
I need help.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.080
So I sought counsel.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.910
I actually went to
counseling for a season.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.980
and just so you guys know, when was this?

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.229
This was during planting a church.

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:48.330
Hey  pastors doster with depression
in the midst of planting a

00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:49.360
church, it happens, right?

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.170
I, I sought mentors.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.940
I have a couple of  men
that are in my life that.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.710
That meet with me monthly and
they ask how I'm doing it.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.550
And the craziest thing is, guys, I'm in
the middle of writing this message and I

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.240
get a text message from one of those guys
that says, Hey, I'm praying for you that

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.440
you're mentally strong, that that God is
speaking to you, that he's encouraging you

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.970
where you are, even if you're struggling.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.311
And I'm just like, see, this is why
I invited these people into my life.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.740
Just so you know, even some
of the most basic things, you

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.520
know what I started doing?

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.380
I started eating a little bit differently.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.470
I started getting a little bit
more sleep because sometimes.

00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:21.365
That's what we need.

00:08:21.785 --> 00:08:24.455
I remember feeling so guilty
being so run down in the middle

00:08:24.455 --> 00:08:25.715
of the day to take a nap.

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:26.735
I felt so guilty.

00:08:27.095 --> 00:08:27.515
And you know what?

00:08:27.515 --> 00:08:28.775
My wife said, well just take a nap.

00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:31.565
And when I would do that, it would help.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.860
And those are some of the small
things that we can look at and see.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.679
but I'm hoping that you'll be
encouraged from the word of God today.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.270
And I really wanna start
with this verse here.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.929
It may not be encouraging to you,
and at times it can be discouraging,

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.120
but I'm hoping by the end of the
day day you'll be encouraged.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.100
So Proverbs 1225 says this, anxiety
in the heart of man causes depression,

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.620
but a good word makes it glad.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.319
And you may say, is it really that simple?

00:08:56.415 --> 00:08:57.525
Hmm, maybe not.

00:08:58.035 --> 00:08:59.625
But what I would say is consistent.

00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:00.135
Good word.

00:09:00.135 --> 00:09:03.315
A consistent good word, which means
as you speak God's truths over your

00:09:03.315 --> 00:09:06.435
life, as you speak, the things that are
saying, okay, I can get through this,

00:09:06.435 --> 00:09:08.175
through help and inviting people in.

00:09:08.175 --> 00:09:10.665
Yes, a good word can.

00:09:10.665 --> 00:09:11.865
Make you glad.

00:09:11.925 --> 00:09:14.055
It is that simple over time.

00:09:14.115 --> 00:09:16.694
And so my hope and prayer
today is, it is a good word.

00:09:16.964 --> 00:09:18.704
And so we're gonna talk about
again, those two truths.

00:09:18.709 --> 00:09:19.905
So remember when battling depression.

00:09:19.905 --> 00:09:21.555
So let's pray as we jump in.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.245
Lord Jesus, only you can
move in our hearts and lives.

00:09:25.245 --> 00:09:32.625
And Lord, I know today  I am not
speaking out of   strength in the fact

00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:34.064
of though I've got this all figured out.

00:09:34.064 --> 00:09:36.275
Lord, I'm really speaking out of weakness.

00:09:36.854 --> 00:09:40.125
and Lord, I'm reminded that you do great
and mighty things through weakness.

00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:45.045
So, Lord, may I be weak today so that you
can be strong and that you can speak to

00:09:45.045 --> 00:09:49.155
the hearts of those in this room and that
you can minister them right where they

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:52.545
are, Lord, whether they're dealing with
depression right now, whether they're

00:09:52.545 --> 00:09:57.015
dealing with anxiety or worry or burnout
or whatever it is, Lord, maybe if they're

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.775
not dealing with it and they do it in the
future, Lord, will you give them a word

00:09:59.775 --> 00:10:05.415
today to clinging to a word today that
can be encouraging And remind them, Lord

00:10:05.415 --> 00:10:09.015
of your love and your truth, and remind
them that the are, they are not alone.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.589
So, Lord, I just pray that you
move, like only you can move and

00:10:13.589 --> 00:10:14.490
we pray this in your heaven name.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.360
Amen.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:20.970
So, so we look at depression, it
can come across as  a complex issue.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.380
And so again, I wanna make sure,
please don't look and say, well  I've

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.670
got it all figured out cuz I don't.

00:10:26.675 --> 00:10:27.860
And so I wanna give you what I do know.

00:10:28.785 --> 00:10:30.705
And I pray that that
helps you take next steps.

00:10:30.735 --> 00:10:31.515
I really wanna say that again.

00:10:31.515 --> 00:10:34.665
I wanna do everything I can to
help you where you are, but knowing

00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:37.375
that I'm not the end result of
professionalism on depression.

00:10:37.695 --> 00:10:40.325
and so this is here to
help and, and to guide us.

00:10:40.615 --> 00:10:43.275
and so there's a couple of
root causes to depression.

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:45.585
I wanna talk about them just so
we kind of all know, or that is,

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.735
experts say that they start with.

00:10:47.435 --> 00:10:48.395
Could be biological.

00:10:48.395 --> 00:10:49.474
And so I wanna give some examples.

00:10:49.474 --> 00:10:52.354
So depression could come from
just a chemical imbalance in

00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:53.734
our bodies or in our brains.

00:10:53.974 --> 00:10:58.084
Some of that could be  when we're
talking about  hormonal changes.

00:10:58.084 --> 00:11:00.425
I know that sounds really
funny, but a lot of women go

00:11:00.425 --> 00:11:02.555
through  postpartum depression.

00:11:02.584 --> 00:11:04.084
I remember Britney dealt
with that at times.

00:11:04.084 --> 00:11:08.015
And a lot of times we don't know
why we're crying or why we're going

00:11:08.015 --> 00:11:08.765
through what we're going through.

00:11:08.765 --> 00:11:09.844
And so that could be an issue.

00:11:09.844 --> 00:11:12.035
Some of it could be nutritional or sleep.

00:11:12.035 --> 00:11:14.435
Some of it could be passed down
from your biological makeup.

00:11:15.105 --> 00:11:17.355
Some of it could be relational,
and so this could be this, you're

00:11:17.355 --> 00:11:18.495
having struggles in your marriage.

00:11:18.495 --> 00:11:19.845
Maybe you just had a divorce.

00:11:19.905 --> 00:11:23.025
Maybe you're having a wayward child
that has run away from the faith or

00:11:23.205 --> 00:11:24.705
is not around the family anymore.

00:11:25.125 --> 00:11:26.845
It could be isolation.

00:11:27.325 --> 00:11:29.265
Again, we came out of a season
of Covid where a lot of us

00:11:29.265 --> 00:11:31.695
experienced isolation, so you could
have had depression during them.

00:11:32.115 --> 00:11:33.365
It's also could be circumstantial.

00:11:34.605 --> 00:11:37.255
Would say this, a death of a loved
one could have led you to depression.

00:11:37.715 --> 00:11:40.605
something that you've gone through
trauma, and again, it could be

00:11:40.605 --> 00:11:43.425
abuse, it could be something in
the past that you've dealt with.

00:11:43.785 --> 00:11:47.445
It could also just be that your
last child left the house and you're

00:11:47.445 --> 00:11:48.705
dealing with the empty nesting feeling.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.585
I'm, I'm telling you, my wife's gonna go
through that because she loves her kids.

00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:53.215
The moment the last child's
out, it's gonna be difficult.

00:11:54.225 --> 00:11:55.845
For some of you, it
could just be spiritual.

00:11:55.905 --> 00:11:58.875
And this is what we wanna recognize, and
we wanna remember that the word of God

00:11:58.875 --> 00:12:04.245
says this, that we do not battle against
flesh and blood, but we have a very real

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:08.985
spiritual battle against the enemy that is
the forces of darkness that wants to still

00:12:09.225 --> 00:12:12.765
kill and destroy everything that matters
to you and everything that matters to God.

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:14.955
And I wanna start just
right there for a second.

00:12:14.955 --> 00:12:19.305
Do you know that you matter to God
more than anything else in this world?

00:12:19.755 --> 00:12:22.454
You matter to God more than
anything else in the world.

00:12:22.814 --> 00:12:26.535
So when we talk about having an enemy
that's spiritually attacking us, he's

00:12:26.865 --> 00:12:30.735
his goal is to spiritually attack
you because we are his greatest love.

00:12:30.944 --> 00:12:34.845
And so knowing that may not be comforting
to you, but if we know that these are some

00:12:34.845 --> 00:12:38.645
of the reasons why we have depression,
and what I would say is it's okay.

00:12:39.145 --> 00:12:43.454
And the reason why it's okay is all
these situations are outta our control.

00:12:43.454 --> 00:12:45.225
The majority of the time,
they're out of our control.

00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:46.545
We don't know what to do.

00:12:47.145 --> 00:12:50.295
But God is still present in
the midst of our circumstances.

00:12:50.295 --> 00:12:52.035
And we're gonna talk about
somebody that's gonna hopefully

00:12:52.035 --> 00:12:53.385
relate to you in the word of God.

00:12:53.835 --> 00:12:56.595
But I wanna remind you again,
depression does not discriminate.

00:12:56.595 --> 00:12:59.115
Everyone's susceptible to it,
but one, there's not a one size

00:12:59.115 --> 00:13:00.675
fits all on how we address it.

00:13:01.095 --> 00:13:02.326
And so I, I just want you to know that.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.449
So as we address this  from a
spiritual standpoint, I want you

00:13:06.449 --> 00:13:08.040
to hear about a guy named Jeremiah.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.439
Most believe Jeremiah
is a part of this story.

00:13:10.439 --> 00:13:12.449
So we're gonna be in
Lamentations chapter three.

00:13:12.449 --> 00:13:13.770
Lamentations chapter three.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.740
If you've ever read the book of
Lamentations, raise your hand.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:17.640
Yeah.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.390
See, not a lot of people read limitations,
and so it's not as bad as, you know,

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.260
Leviticus or numbers, but it's one of
those that people don't typically go

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.410
into because it's a book of lament.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.960
and really it's, it's kind
of sad  as we read it.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.430
And so most believe in this book that
Jeremiah is the, the one that is talking

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:40.410
about this story, and he has an Old
Testament prophet  that was depressed.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.025
That he  spoke on the
behalf of God, right?

00:13:44.025 --> 00:13:48.314
He spoke to the people of Israel, God's
people, and he spoke the, the, the

00:13:48.314 --> 00:13:50.235
coming prophecies that were gonna happen.

00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:52.875
And here's what had just got
done happening for Jeremiah.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.810
So Jeremiah being a prophet, in the time
when the people of Israel, these are

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.890
God's people were exiled, which they
were kicked out of their land, people

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.740
came in, conquered them and exiled them.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.390
So Jeremiah saw a couple
of different things.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.950
Number one, Jeremiah saw
his family and his friends.

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:11.574
Killed and exiled from their land.

00:14:11.995 --> 00:14:16.255
Jeremiah got to see in this standpoint
also the temple of God, which most

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:18.655
of us may not fully understand
because if we look at it, if we

00:14:18.655 --> 00:14:20.814
think of a temple of God today,
we're thinking we're in the Y M C A.

00:14:20.814 --> 00:14:23.135
This is the closest thing we got
as a church to the temple of God.

00:14:23.814 --> 00:14:27.235
it may not mean much to you if somehow
this got destroyed, but for the people

00:14:27.235 --> 00:14:31.074
of Israel and for Jeremiah, their
temple was known as that's where the

00:14:31.074 --> 00:14:34.224
presence of God was and it was destroyed.

00:14:34.765 --> 00:14:40.035
So Jeremiah watching all these things,
Begins to be depressed and, and he

00:14:40.035 --> 00:14:42.975
has a reason why when we think about
this, this is probably trauma for him.

00:14:43.454 --> 00:14:45.105
And this is a man of God, right?

00:14:45.105 --> 00:14:45.855
A man of God.

00:14:45.855 --> 00:14:50.145
And as he's going through this, he
has a moment where he's without hope.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.280
And so if you've ever battled with
depression, I hope this encouraged

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.420
you to know you're not alone.

00:14:54.569 --> 00:14:58.380
Even a man of God in the
Word of God was broken.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.339
And so let's read this together.

00:14:59.344 --> 00:15:02.189
We're gonna read verses one through
eight, and then we're gonna jump

00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:04.050
to 17 through 20 after that.

00:15:04.055 --> 00:15:07.260
And so again, Lamentations chapter
three, it'll be up on the screen as well.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:12.380
It says this, I am a man who has seen
affliction under the rod of God's wrath.

00:15:12.599 --> 00:15:16.800
He has driven me away and forced me
to walk in darkness instead of light.

00:15:17.099 --> 00:15:20.189
Yes, he repeatedly turns his
hand against me all the day long.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.680
He has worn away my flesh in my skin.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.910
He has broken my bones.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.750
He has laid siege against me in circling
me with bitterness and hardship.

00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:33.000
He has made me dwell in darkness like
those who have been dead for ages.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.849
He has walled me in and
so I cannot get out.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.349
He has weighed me down with chains
even when I cry out and plead for help.

00:15:40.354 --> 00:15:41.550
He blocks up my prayer.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.200
Then we're gonna move down to 17.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.600
And he says this, I have
been deprived of peace.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.760
I have forgotten what prosperity is.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.050
And then I thought my future is lost,
as well as my hope from the Lord.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.370
Remember, my affliction in my
homelessness, the wormwood and the poison.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:00.230
I continually remember them
and I have become depressed.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.640
So you're like, ah, man.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.930
Did I come to service today to just
leave out depressed and discourage?

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:13.695
My hope is, That when we see that a
man of God who was being used by God,

00:16:13.695 --> 00:16:17.085
God's presence was near him, even
though he felt like the Lord was doing

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.425
all these things, there's a hope on
the other side that we'll get to.

00:16:19.815 --> 00:16:22.035
But I want us to start with
this first statement here, and

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.265
I think this is so important.

00:16:23.685 --> 00:16:27.855
Number one, your emotions are
valid, but they're not permanent.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.335
Permanent.

00:16:28.335 --> 00:16:31.185
Your emotions are valid, but
they're not permanent, and why

00:16:31.185 --> 00:16:32.415
is it important to know that?

00:16:32.415 --> 00:16:37.680
and I, I'll just go to a quick example
because it's gonna really relate with you.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.930
Those who've had kids,
anybody ever watch Frozen?

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.510
I know we're going outside the Bible here.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.860
What does she say?

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.000
Conceal don't fill.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.370
She tried to claim her emotions
were not real and it destroyed her.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.949
And I know this is not in the Bible,
but I'm telling you that's a real word.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.665
if you're a family that has kids,
knows that movie, You get it.

00:16:59.445 --> 00:17:04.485
But when she did begin to recognize
she was different and she began to

00:17:04.485 --> 00:17:06.825
speak about it in a little bit, did
you see how it changed her life?

00:17:06.975 --> 00:17:11.565
And I know we're talking about a cartoon
character, but guys, I'm, I'm trying

00:17:11.565 --> 00:17:14.535
to relate with you because sometimes
we look at the prophet of God and we're

00:17:14.535 --> 00:17:15.917
going, eh, I can't really relate to him.

00:17:16.545 --> 00:17:17.415
And this is a cartoon.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.285
Maybe you can't relate to her.

00:17:18.315 --> 00:17:18.945
I don't get it.

00:17:18.945 --> 00:17:21.585
But they, they mirrored this after
somebody who would probably be

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:25.035
dealing with depression and anxiety
and stress over her situations.

00:17:25.065 --> 00:17:28.875
And it was real whenever she began to
address it and get open and own it.

00:17:29.495 --> 00:17:32.215
I, I, I'm telling you,
our emotions are valid.

00:17:33.284 --> 00:17:34.304
But they're not permanent.

00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:36.855
I remember my pastor telling
me me this all the time.

00:17:37.425 --> 00:17:39.435
He says, and it has come to pass.

00:17:39.435 --> 00:17:41.655
He says, it's this word that
you'll see in the Bible, and it

00:17:41.655 --> 00:17:43.965
came to pass and it came to pass.

00:17:44.115 --> 00:17:47.534
Meaning this, what situation
we're going through right now

00:17:47.715 --> 00:17:49.665
is not our permanent situation.

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:53.415
It will one day come to pass, and
most of us, when we begin to look

00:17:53.415 --> 00:17:57.945
at life, we're either going into a
storm, we're in the midst of a storm,

00:17:57.975 --> 00:17:59.595
or we're coming out of a storm.

00:18:00.449 --> 00:18:01.409
It's reality.

00:18:01.409 --> 00:18:04.050
And it's those moments where recently
I remember telling my wife, I feel

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.310
like we're coming out of a storm.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.979
I said, Lord, please keep it away.

00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:09.209
Please keep it away.

00:18:09.449 --> 00:18:11.010
And yesterday I woke up
with a crick of my neck.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.379
My car broke down and our house,
our roofs leaking this morning.

00:18:13.379 --> 00:18:14.580
I'm like, okay, it's back.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:15.750
it's back.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.179
and it's those moments like,
okay, Lord, what are you doing?

00:18:18.229 --> 00:18:18.580
Right?

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.399
And, and so we'll get to that, but.

00:18:21.195 --> 00:18:25.935
I'm telling you, like understanding
that it's not permanent is so important.

00:18:26.565 --> 00:18:28.395
So our emotions, again, they're valid.

00:18:28.395 --> 00:18:30.075
Just like Jeremiah's emotions to the Lord.

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:31.905
He was honest, like I felt
like you've left me, Lord.

00:18:32.115 --> 00:18:33.885
Like if you abandoned me, your
wraths been poured outta me.

00:18:34.004 --> 00:18:35.294
Like this is horrible.

00:18:35.745 --> 00:18:37.935
Jeremiah was honest before the Lord.

00:18:39.389 --> 00:18:42.225
And I tell you, just from a personal
experience, I want to continue

00:18:42.225 --> 00:18:44.504
to give my personal experience
because of battle with depression.

00:18:44.834 --> 00:18:50.594
The moment I sat down with my wife and
begin to explain my emotions and why I

00:18:50.594 --> 00:18:54.615
felt the way I felt and how I felt like
I couldn't change anything, it changed

00:18:54.615 --> 00:18:56.054
the way we addressed those emotions.

00:18:56.115 --> 00:19:02.054
It changed it as a family because I was
realizing that it was okay to feel that

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.885
way, that I didn't need to beat myself up.

00:19:04.274 --> 00:19:05.895
It wasn't my fault.

00:19:06.675 --> 00:19:07.635
It wasn't my fault.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.395
And it's okay to not be okay.

00:19:11.325 --> 00:19:12.465
You need to hear that today.

00:19:12.825 --> 00:19:14.415
Somebody needs to hear that out today.

00:19:14.774 --> 00:19:17.175
It is okay not to be okay.

00:19:19.885 --> 00:19:22.905
This is a safe place to not be.

00:19:22.905 --> 00:19:23.205
Okay.

00:19:23.745 --> 00:19:27.555
This church, I believe God planted
this church in this city to be a

00:19:27.555 --> 00:19:30.375
place where it's okay to not be okay.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.535
And maybe it's not depression.

00:19:32.865 --> 00:19:33.855
Maybe it's a marriage struggle.

00:19:33.885 --> 00:19:34.935
Maybe it's a wayward, a child.

00:19:35.085 --> 00:19:36.075
Maybe it's anxiety.

00:19:36.225 --> 00:19:37.485
Maybe it's the pressures of life.

00:19:37.575 --> 00:19:38.565
Maybe it's work.

00:19:38.775 --> 00:19:42.045
I don't know what you're dealing with,
but it is safe to not be okay here.

00:19:43.995 --> 00:19:44.865
But here's the good news.

00:19:46.005 --> 00:19:46.725
It's not permanent.

00:19:48.435 --> 00:19:48.975
It's not permanent.

00:19:48.975 --> 00:19:51.645
There's people all over this place
that are coming outta the storms.

00:19:51.855 --> 00:19:54.255
God's doing something cool in their
life and they've came out of that major.

00:19:54.345 --> 00:19:56.505
There's some people that are right in
the midst of them, and it may be you.

00:19:57.195 --> 00:19:57.855
There's some of you.

00:19:59.085 --> 00:19:59.925
You're heading into 'em.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.425
That was me yesterday.

00:20:01.545 --> 00:20:04.875
I'm heading into 'em and I'm like,
okay, I know the word of God.

00:20:04.875 --> 00:20:06.735
I know what God's done for these people.

00:20:06.735 --> 00:20:09.705
I know that my emotions are
valid, but they're not permanent.

00:20:09.945 --> 00:20:11.865
It, this too shall come to pass.

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:14.175
And for me, it's so freeing.

00:20:14.625 --> 00:20:17.115
So freeing to be real in my emotions.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.945
It's so freeing to not suppress them
and claim that I should just suck it up.

00:20:23.085 --> 00:20:26.565
It's so freeing for me, and I
believe that's what God is saying

00:20:26.565 --> 00:20:28.185
even to Jeremiah, be real with me.

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:29.325
It's okay to be real.

00:20:29.385 --> 00:20:32.415
This is what you're going through, and
here's what we realize when we think

00:20:32.415 --> 00:20:37.004
about sharing these things and being real
experts will tell us that this is one of

00:20:37.004 --> 00:20:42.284
the greatest ways to heal as we change
our emotions and as we begin to overcome

00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:47.385
depression, it starts by acknowledging
our emotions and naming them.

00:20:48.195 --> 00:20:51.314
Acknowledging our emotions
and naming them, and that's

00:20:51.314 --> 00:20:52.695
just what Jeremiah did, right?

00:20:52.695 --> 00:20:54.645
As we look over some of his story, right?

00:20:54.945 --> 00:20:57.675
He says, basically, when you begin
to think about how he describes

00:20:57.675 --> 00:21:00.524
this, he says, I, I basically feel
like my flesh has been worn away,

00:21:00.615 --> 00:21:03.044
and my skin and my bones are broken.

00:21:03.735 --> 00:21:05.975
He, he says, you know, I, I'm
in circle with bitterness.

00:21:06.945 --> 00:21:09.314
At the end, we see here,
he says, I'm depressed.

00:21:09.915 --> 00:21:13.004
So maybe for you, when we think
about acknowledging everybody,

00:21:13.004 --> 00:21:13.814
say, acknowledge with me.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:14.595
Just say Acknowledge.

00:21:14.595 --> 00:21:14.804
Acknowledge.

00:21:15.824 --> 00:21:16.905
Just acknowledge.

00:21:18.254 --> 00:21:19.095
What you're going through.

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:20.955
Maybe this is what you're gonna say.

00:21:21.284 --> 00:21:22.334
I'm feeling hopeless.

00:21:22.905 --> 00:21:23.774
I'm feeling angry.

00:21:23.774 --> 00:21:24.345
I'm hurt.

00:21:25.845 --> 00:21:26.175
Right?

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:27.345
I'm mad at God.

00:21:27.584 --> 00:21:29.385
Tell 'em I've done it.

00:21:30.195 --> 00:21:31.215
I haven't been smited yet.

00:21:31.274 --> 00:21:31.784
Okay.

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:34.215
Don't, don't wait for that though.

00:21:34.274 --> 00:21:35.639
Don't wait for that.

00:21:35.639 --> 00:21:37.544
maybe you say, I'm
depressed and I'm lonely.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.915
Maybe you say this and
I remember those days.

00:21:40.455 --> 00:21:41.084
I feel numb.

00:21:41.865 --> 00:21:42.495
I feel numb.

00:21:43.215 --> 00:21:43.455
Right?

00:21:43.455 --> 00:21:45.855
Whatever it is, begin
to name those things.

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:49.004
Not only in your head, but out loud.

00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:53.024
Share it with someone,
write it in a journal.

00:21:54.195 --> 00:21:56.625
Tell a friend or a spouse, right?

00:21:58.065 --> 00:21:59.985
And I want you to begin to think
about those things now because as we

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:03.735
go into invitation later, I want you
to lay them down at, at Jesus's feet.

00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:05.685
I want you to begin to
think about 'em now.

00:22:05.815 --> 00:22:09.794
Begin to name those emotions, and today
we're gonna lay them outta Jesus' feet.

00:22:13.125 --> 00:22:17.415
So those of you that are
dealing with depression, This

00:22:17.475 --> 00:22:18.495
is something that we need to do.

00:22:18.495 --> 00:22:21.044
Those of you that don't
deal with oppression, let me

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.235
encourage you, be a friend.

00:22:24.495 --> 00:22:26.475
Listen without judgment.

00:22:27.675 --> 00:22:28.965
Here's another encouragement.

00:22:29.354 --> 00:22:30.004
I'm telling you.

00:22:30.004 --> 00:22:34.185
Society  I think it was last week,
we said  there was a statistic done

00:22:34.189 --> 00:22:39.495
in 2019 that three out of four people
dealt with anxiety pre pandemic.

00:22:39.975 --> 00:22:41.264
That number's only gone up.

00:22:41.504 --> 00:22:43.274
So odds are that's just anxiety.

00:22:43.334 --> 00:22:45.564
Anxiety leads to
depression at times, right?

00:22:46.735 --> 00:22:52.695
odds are if you are in a room with more
than one person, you, and you don't

00:22:52.695 --> 00:22:56.534
deal with depression, odds are there's
one person in that room that does my

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:02.054
encouragement for you is look for a
person whose posture is low, whose head

00:23:02.054 --> 00:23:08.235
is down, who begins to be quiet and
just ask, Hey, how can I pray for you?

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:09.825
What's going on in life?

00:23:11.415 --> 00:23:15.825
This is a safe place without
judgment, maybe you can be the person

00:23:15.825 --> 00:23:19.545
that allows them to be free, like
Jeremiah's gonna see here as he's

00:23:19.545 --> 00:23:22.065
freeing from sharing his struggles.

00:23:22.875 --> 00:23:24.795
So I wanna give you a practical
example that's really cool

00:23:24.795 --> 00:23:26.295
that kind of backs this up.

00:23:26.835 --> 00:23:30.075
anybody in here afraid of spiders?

00:23:30.825 --> 00:23:31.935
Okay, there's a couple of y'all.

00:23:32.235 --> 00:23:35.055
When I started reading this
example, if it would've said

00:23:35.055 --> 00:23:36.825
snakes, I would've been that person.

00:23:36.825 --> 00:23:40.125
Here's the thing, truth be told,
if there's a snake in my home,

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:41.146
guarantee I'm gonna burn it down.

00:23:43.035 --> 00:23:43.995
You think I'm kidding?

00:23:44.595 --> 00:23:46.365
I'll call insurance and
say it's their fault.

00:23:46.365 --> 00:23:47.325
I mean, it's, I don't know.

00:23:47.715 --> 00:23:48.795
I would burn it down.

00:23:48.795 --> 00:23:49.815
So spiders and.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.284
But snakes, that's me.

00:23:51.284 --> 00:23:52.725
For some of you though,
that could be spiders.

00:23:52.935 --> 00:23:58.725
So they did a, a study, four groups
with four different things that they

00:23:58.725 --> 00:23:59.655
had them address with this study.

00:23:59.655 --> 00:24:02.774
So what that is, they took this tarantula,
they put it in a cage, and they had

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:07.074
people come in and they had four different
groups do four different things, right?

00:24:07.635 --> 00:24:08.715
So this tarantulas in a cage.

00:24:09.185 --> 00:24:11.564
They walk in, let tell you
what the first group does, all

00:24:11.564 --> 00:24:12.345
the way down the fourth group.

00:24:12.345 --> 00:24:15.284
So the first group's gonna come in,
they're gonna see this tarula in the cage.

00:24:15.405 --> 00:24:16.215
They're afraid of spiders.

00:24:16.215 --> 00:24:17.115
By the way, every one of 'em.

00:24:18.485 --> 00:24:22.260
And they're just gonna begin to
speak out loud what they're feeling.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:23.640
They're gonna be labeling.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.290
This thing scares me.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.200
I feel like they're crawling all over me.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.290
Like they're just gonna name their
feelings as they see the spider.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.140
These groups are just gonna come
in and do this one after another.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.810
Then the second group, this is what
they said, I want you to come in

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.870
and I want you to make observations,
which means you know, the trenchless

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.330
in a cage, or, Hey, it's big.

00:24:43.345 --> 00:24:46.560
The next group, they had come in and
they said, say something irrelevant,

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.700
which I think this one's a funny one.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.500
So they walked in,
they're like, it's cold.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.610
I like the color blue.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:50.970
Right?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.030
They just begin to name the
odd, weird, irrelevant things.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.400
And the last group they
said, don't say anything.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:00.450
Just go in, look at the Tula
in the cage and walk away.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:01.531
They did that.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.870
A week later, they bring
the same group back.

00:25:04.665 --> 00:25:09.945
Then they begin to monitor some of their
expressions, their body temperature,

00:25:10.125 --> 00:25:12.285
all these different things, whether
they peed themselves when they walked

00:25:12.285 --> 00:25:15.705
in the room, because this time the
tarantula was outside the cage...

00:25:18.945 --> 00:25:19.845
not going in there.

00:25:20.325 --> 00:25:24.855
What they found is those who were in
group one that had labeled their fillings

00:25:26.085 --> 00:25:31.265
actually had less anxiety and was actually
some of them were able to pet the tarula.

00:25:31.935 --> 00:25:35.055
Because they had began to name their
feelings, but those who never made and

00:25:35.055 --> 00:25:37.455
named their feelings, they began to find
that those are the ones that struggled

00:25:37.455 --> 00:25:40.005
the most with that spider being out.

00:25:40.365 --> 00:25:41.295
And that's not a spider's strange.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:41.525
I know.

00:25:42.105 --> 00:25:46.425
Anyways, this is just, and we're talking
about, again, I wanna give you biblical

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:50.085
examples, but I want you to also
see this, that naming your feelings.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.889
It's part of science
Experts have studied this.

00:25:52.889 --> 00:25:57.000
It is so important for us to be open
and honest and out loud about our

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.100
emotions and our feelings to label them.

00:25:59.399 --> 00:26:01.260
To label them again, your feelings.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:02.460
They're valid.

00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:06.210
They're valid, but they're not permanent.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:11.399
And I think when we act like our
emotions don't matter, we'll never

00:26:11.399 --> 00:26:13.050
address the reality of our situation.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.169
I, I'm giving you this also from.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.030
Just my personal experience, I was
not able to begin to overcome my

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.190
depression until I begin to name them.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.500
That's what, that's what my counselor did.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.220
He says, okay, I want you to write
down why you're going through this.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.450
Like what is your emotions?

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.220
He had me, I'm gonna share
something with you later.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.350
He had me write the
beginning of my counseling.

00:26:34.355 --> 00:26:35.100
You know what he had me do?

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.160
He says, in eight weeks, I want you
to write down if this was successful,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.180
what would your life look like?

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:40.830
And I'm like, really?

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.730
Okay.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:42.720
And I did.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.030
And we got to the eight weeks and
I pulled it up and I'm like, wow.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.800
I'm experiencing this now.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.120
I can't wait to share
some of that with you.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.350
So again, when we think about
how important it is to express

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.700
our emotions, it, it's important.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.090
But I really, I want to draw
you in quickly about this, and

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:59.460
this is why it's so important to
understand that our emotions are

00:26:59.465 --> 00:27:04.320
valid, but they're not permanent
because our emotions are temporary.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.250
It's important to remember we aren't
going to make permanent decisions

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:09.690
based upon temporary emotions.

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.590
I'm gonna say this again because
our emotions are temporary.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.820
We're not going to make permanent
decisions based upon temporary emotions.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.170
It's so important for us to feel this
way and to understand this, so when

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:26.625
we're feeling depressed, We can't make
these permanent life altering decisions.

00:27:26.835 --> 00:27:29.865
And here's the reason why I wanna share
something with you, and this is why I look

00:27:29.865 --> 00:27:31.695
at the stories that God brings to my life.

00:27:31.695 --> 00:27:34.905
So, in the middle of going through some
of this depression, I began to follow this

00:27:34.905 --> 00:27:39.615
pastor on a podcast and he began to  share
about how he had dealt with depression.

00:27:39.615 --> 00:27:41.050
He had left a  a jah.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.695
He was actually fired from a pastoral
position because of some sin in

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:46.665
his life, and he had battled with
depression, and he began to overcome it.

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:49.305
He began to teach other pastors
about how to overcome depression.

00:27:49.709 --> 00:27:51.780
And he was talking on this podcast,
and so I was drawn in, cause

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:52.590
I'm just listening to this guy.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.310
I was drawn in.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.490
Not long after that, I jumped on
the podcast and he wasn't on there

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:59.760
anymore and his friend came on and his
friend says, Hey, just recently we've

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.419
lost our friend who was out on a gun
range and decided to take his life.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.949
A pastor took his own life after
he had claimed that he had been

00:28:07.955 --> 00:28:11.399
dealing with oppression and he'd been
teaching people how to overcome it.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.730
If that doesn't stop you in
your tracks, it did for me.

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:18.840
It stopped me in my tracks, our emotions.

00:28:19.695 --> 00:28:26.055
Are temporary, but we cannot make
permanent decisions with our emotions.

00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:29.145
If that don't get real for
you, it got real for me.

00:28:29.745 --> 00:28:32.955
And that is part of why I
think it's so important.

00:28:33.285 --> 00:28:38.145
Don't let the enemy deceive you to
stay where you're at, to not talk to

00:28:38.145 --> 00:28:41.985
anybody, to not invite professionals
in or to let your church family

00:28:42.015 --> 00:28:45.675
in or your, or your spouse in on
what you're wrestling through.

00:28:46.155 --> 00:28:47.805
We're talking about life here.

00:28:48.285 --> 00:28:48.675
Life.

00:28:49.605 --> 00:28:52.725
Don't forget how important that is.

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:55.754
So again, don't make
those permanent decisions.

00:28:55.754 --> 00:28:57.195
What other permanent
decisions could we do?

00:28:57.465 --> 00:28:57.825
Right?

00:28:57.825 --> 00:29:01.185
Just because your spouse
disappoints you doesn't mean

00:29:01.185 --> 00:29:04.695
you need to go make a permanent
decision of cheating or divorcing.

00:29:05.235 --> 00:29:09.495
That is a hard thing because sometimes
our spouses are the most difficult.

00:29:10.245 --> 00:29:10.995
I get it.

00:29:11.055 --> 00:29:13.784
Marriage is hard, but don't
make the permanent decision.

00:29:13.815 --> 00:29:16.575
That could obviously affect that abuse.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.285
If you're in the middle of
and you're angry, walk away.

00:29:21.915 --> 00:29:22.605
Walk away.

00:29:23.535 --> 00:29:26.055
Don't do it again.

00:29:26.055 --> 00:29:27.705
Don't take your life if that's what it is.

00:29:27.765 --> 00:29:32.445
And if that's ever crossed your mind,
please, I'm begging you right now.

00:29:34.185 --> 00:29:37.305
Tell someone, talk to a counselor.

00:29:38.295 --> 00:29:40.215
Be willing to ask for help.

00:29:40.905 --> 00:29:42.545
It's not worth that long-term decision.

00:29:44.145 --> 00:29:45.905
So also I want to challenge you with this.

00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:46.605
This is another one.

00:29:46.605 --> 00:29:47.264
Draw back in.

00:29:47.475 --> 00:29:47.715
Okay.

00:29:48.254 --> 00:29:50.685
Also, we're not gonna make
permanent conclusions.

00:29:50.925 --> 00:29:52.304
Let me just give you another example.

00:29:52.544 --> 00:29:56.324
Well, because my husband or my wife
cheated on me, everybody will cheat on me.

00:29:56.625 --> 00:29:58.995
I'm never gonna trust
another person again.

00:29:59.145 --> 00:30:01.814
Let me just give you another one
that's even gonna relate to you.

00:30:01.814 --> 00:30:06.105
If you have been a part of a church
that has had some bad experiences,

00:30:06.105 --> 00:30:07.995
anybody been a part of a church
that has some bad experiences?

00:30:07.995 --> 00:30:08.324
Anybody?

00:30:08.355 --> 00:30:08.745
Okay, good.

00:30:08.745 --> 00:30:09.975
We got a lot of hands going up here.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.590
Sometimes they do things that really
frustrates you, really disappoint you.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:21.030
And then what's gonna happen and what
maybe has happened to you before is

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:24.450
you now view every church as that way
that church is gonna be a church that

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:28.320
always, I can't trust them anymore,
and you'll never attend a church again.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.060
I know you're here, so praise God.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.710
If that was you, I'm so glad you're here.

00:30:32.594 --> 00:30:37.245
But know that we do not make permanent
conclusions based upon temporary emotions

00:30:37.245 --> 00:30:42.645
either, because I'll say this, you'll miss
on experiencing some of the most amazing

00:30:42.645 --> 00:30:46.365
things that God has for you, some of the
most amazing things that God has for you.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:50.115
Yes, it may take time, and I'm not
asking you to fully trust because at

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.355
times that will break you again, but
what I mean is we need to continue to

00:30:53.355 --> 00:30:55.814
take steps to get past that, right?

00:30:56.534 --> 00:31:00.165
So in your darkest of times, maybe
you felt giving up, but that's exactly

00:31:00.165 --> 00:31:01.365
again, where the enemy wants you.

00:31:02.225 --> 00:31:06.300
But I want you to know this, God
did not make you as a mistake.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:07.890
He had a purpose for you.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.390
And you know what keeps me going?

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.190
And this is crazy for you.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:14.220
My family obviously keeps me going,
but there's someone, there's someone

00:31:14.225 --> 00:31:18.990
waiting on me to address my emotional
struggles, my mental struggles.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:24.180
Because if I will, and I'll be open about
it, it may impact one other person's life.

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:25.620
That's what keeps me going.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:31.020
Knowing that being real up here with
you all may seem embarrassing at times.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.545
I know it's valuable for one person.

00:31:34.725 --> 00:31:38.175
I hope it's valuable for one person, and
the rest of y'all that wanna judge me, I

00:31:38.175 --> 00:31:44.955
don't care because I care about that one
person that may walk outta here and choose

00:31:45.045 --> 00:31:46.395
not to make that permanent decision.

00:31:46.815 --> 00:31:49.245
May choose to begin to get
help and talk to someone.

00:31:50.355 --> 00:31:51.645
That's the church that I wanna lead.

00:31:51.645 --> 00:31:55.245
That's a church I wanna be a part of with
so many of you that I know has already

00:31:55.245 --> 00:31:57.555
done that and will continue to do that.

00:31:58.545 --> 00:32:00.135
So I wanna move on, right?

00:32:00.375 --> 00:32:02.715
We're not ruled or controlled
by these emotions, right?

00:32:02.715 --> 00:32:03.465
We can feel them.

00:32:03.465 --> 00:32:05.925
We can obviously understand that.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.575
But here's the last statement.

00:32:07.605 --> 00:32:12.105
Our situation may feel hopeless,
right, and may feel hopeless, but

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:14.375
with God, there is always hope.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.950
What happened, Jeremiah,
I, I wanna go on now.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.970
What happened to Jeremiah?

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:18.960
He began to be real.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.260
He addressed his emotions, he
explained it and told the Lord

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.310
he was honest before the Lord.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.290
And let's look at verses 21 through 23.

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:28.889
In Lamentations three, it says this,
yet I, so let's look at verse 20.

00:32:28.895 --> 00:32:31.470
So he says, I continually remember them.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:37.170
All these things, my emotions, and I have
become depressed, yet I call to mind.

00:32:37.379 --> 00:32:41.520
And therefore, I have hope
because the Lord's faithful love.

00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:45.600
We do not perish for
his mercies never end.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.639
They are new every morning.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.330
Great.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:50.250
Is your faithfulness great?

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:51.210
Is your faithfulness.

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:56.850
Although he was depressed, he remembered
God's faithfulness in the past.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.800
Now here's, I wanna, I
wanna share this with you.

00:32:59.899 --> 00:33:04.530
Jeremiah had seen the Lord move in his
life in mighty and miraculous ways,

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.580
and Jeremiah also was a prophet and
understood God would eventually bring his

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.190
people back from exile to restore them.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:16.050
That God would eventually send a Messiah
to say the whole world from their sins.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:20.040
Jeremiah knew these things and so what
did he did in the midst of his emotions?

00:33:20.045 --> 00:33:20.940
He called them out.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:25.710
He, he named them, but then yet he
remembered the Lord's faithfulness.

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.220
You may wonder, has the Lord
ever done anything for me?

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.480
You may wonder that, and I've
been there, and if that's

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.340
you, here's my encouragement.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:38.250
I hope the Spirit of God begins to
work in your life and remind you.

00:33:38.255 --> 00:33:39.960
God has done so many amazing things.

00:33:40.615 --> 00:33:41.700
He's given you life.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.140
He's given you a family.

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:44.910
He's provided you to this point.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.270
He's given you the opportunity to get
around, hopefully, a community of people

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.250
that loves you despite your floss.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:53.100
And I'm so thankful I've got a people
that love me despite mine, okay?

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.640
I, God has in so many mainy things
for you, but if you can't name one,

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.500
you know what I encourage you to do?

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:03.990
Clean to the promises of God, of what
he has provided for those before.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.800
And as you begin to do that,
I promise you, you'll begin to

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.330
experience God's faithfulness.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.949
In the days to come.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:12.000
I've seen it.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:14.219
I've seen it, and I experienced it.

00:34:14.759 --> 00:34:18.989
And he says this, I love this, he says,
and they are new every morning, right?

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.460
His mercies never end.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.889
They are new every morning, and I
just wanna encourage you with this.

00:34:22.895 --> 00:34:25.199
Sometimes we just need sleep.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:31.319
Sometimes we literally just need
to take a day off and sleep.

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:34.710
His mercies are new every morning.

00:34:35.355 --> 00:34:37.154
In the midst of our emotions.

00:34:37.245 --> 00:34:39.764
I, I'm telling you, me and Brittany
have had some conversations and I just

00:34:39.764 --> 00:34:44.835
tell her I need to go to sleep and the
next day my perspective is changed.

00:34:45.855 --> 00:34:50.714
Do you know sleep is rest, which rest is
pausing, pausing his trust in the Lord

00:34:50.714 --> 00:34:52.125
and is putting it back in his hands.

00:34:52.364 --> 00:34:55.355
So many times we miss how
spiritual sleep is, right?

00:34:55.725 --> 00:34:59.714
So his mercies are new every
single day, but he talks about

00:34:59.714 --> 00:35:01.245
the Lord's great love, right?

00:35:01.245 --> 00:35:02.384
The Lord's great love.

00:35:03.825 --> 00:35:05.895
And when we think about what the
Lord's great love is translated

00:35:05.895 --> 00:35:09.525
in this, it's unbreakable devotion
of God's promises, unbreakable

00:35:09.525 --> 00:35:11.295
devotion of God's promises, right?

00:35:11.295 --> 00:35:12.435
And this is what God's saying.

00:35:12.435 --> 00:35:14.775
He will never leave you nor forsake you.

00:35:15.045 --> 00:35:18.404
Even in your darkest moments,
God will come through for you.

00:35:19.634 --> 00:35:21.225
With God there is always hope.

00:35:21.555 --> 00:35:22.485
It may not feel like it.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.660
But there is hope every single day.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.850
So what do we do when we depressed?

00:35:27.029 --> 00:35:28.620
We acknowledge what we're struggling with.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:29.879
We name it.

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:30.990
We say, I'm depressed.

00:35:30.995 --> 00:35:32.220
I'm feeling darkness.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.330
I feel hopeless.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.490
We also acknowledge that we need help.

00:35:35.879 --> 00:35:38.430
Asking for help is not a sign of weakness.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:39.540
It's a sign of strength.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:43.529
It's a sign of wisdom, and I
believe that it starts with

00:35:43.529 --> 00:35:45.390
remembering God's faithfulness.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.045
And then it starts with
inviting people in.

00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:49.065
Maybe it's a doctor.

00:35:49.305 --> 00:35:50.985
Maybe it's adding medicine into your life.

00:35:50.985 --> 00:35:52.125
Maybe it's a diet changer.

00:35:52.125 --> 00:35:52.965
Some more sleep.

00:35:53.265 --> 00:35:55.725
Maybe just maybe, here's a plug.

00:35:56.205 --> 00:35:58.515
You need to get a part of a
inspire group at our church.

00:35:58.695 --> 00:35:59.865
What are inspire groups?

00:36:00.105 --> 00:36:01.305
We have one on Sunday nights.

00:36:01.425 --> 00:36:04.365
We have one on Wednesday nights,
one in Westchester, one in Hamilton.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:05.115
What do we do?

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:05.985
We do life together.

00:36:06.045 --> 00:36:09.465
We get in a room, we
laugh, we pray together.

00:36:09.465 --> 00:36:10.275
We get in the word of God.

00:36:10.275 --> 00:36:11.145
We encourage one another.

00:36:11.145 --> 00:36:13.065
We sometimes eat some good food, right?

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:15.000
Getting community with one another.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.700
Maybe that's where part of
the healing process will be.

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.420
You might start praying,
pausing, and praising.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.009
We did this two weeks ago with anxiety.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:25.650
When we have anxiety come into
our lives, I'm telling you

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.880
guys, I did this yesterday.

00:36:27.299 --> 00:36:33.049
I stopped and I prayed and I paused
and I praised knowing God was going to

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.100
redeem whatever we're going through.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.090
We have to continue to seek Lord in this.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.130
So what happens when we do these things?

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.275
Are you miraculously healed?

00:36:43.545 --> 00:36:43.905
Maybe.

00:36:45.795 --> 00:36:46.695
Is it a process?

00:36:46.995 --> 00:36:48.915
Probably right?

00:36:48.915 --> 00:36:49.305
Probably.

00:36:50.105 --> 00:36:53.595
but I, I'm, I'm reminded of
this, that small steps taken over

00:36:53.595 --> 00:36:56.325
time will produce big results.

00:36:56.505 --> 00:36:59.835
Small steps taken over time
will produce big results.

00:37:00.465 --> 00:37:01.605
I'm challenged by that thought.

00:37:01.605 --> 00:37:02.785
I've shared this analogy with you before.

00:37:03.295 --> 00:37:06.825
When you think about karate and
what's the difference between a

00:37:06.825 --> 00:37:10.230
black belt and a white belt, Yeah.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.500
There you go.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:10.860
Color.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.700
That's Amanda.

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.870
Thanks, Amanda.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.070
You'll run that one.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:19.590
No, it's a white belt who didn't give up.

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.570
They were consistent.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.000
You don't get a white belt overnight
and you're not gonna get it in a year.

00:37:24.005 --> 00:37:24.990
You're gonna get it over.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.300
Consistency every day.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.450
Understand his mercies are new.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:31.530
And taking one small step.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.650
And this is what I love this picture.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.650
What's the difference between a white
belt and someone who doesn't have it?

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:41.400
Someone started for some of y'all.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.280
I'm just telling you, I've been
there because I kept thinking

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.440
I'm depressed, I'm anxious.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.300
Nothing's ever gonna change.

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:49.500
Nothing's ever gonna change.

00:37:49.505 --> 00:37:49.860
And you know what?

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.140
Every day that I thought that
way, nothing ever changed.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.360
Yeah, nothing ever changed.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.280
But then there was a time I
made a decision, I'm gonna

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.260
acknowledge it, and I took a step.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.650
I'm gonna invite some mentors
in, and I took a step.

00:38:05.355 --> 00:38:07.605
I'm gonna call a counselor
and I took a step.

00:38:08.385 --> 00:38:09.405
I'm gonna put a plan together.

00:38:09.615 --> 00:38:10.305
I'm gonna take a step.

00:38:10.785 --> 00:38:12.465
I'm gonna start being real with
some of my closest friends.

00:38:12.465 --> 00:38:17.145
I'm gonna take a step, and over
time I've learned to cope with some

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:18.525
depression that I've had in my life.

00:38:18.555 --> 00:38:19.045
Perfect.

00:38:19.585 --> 00:38:20.715
No, guys.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.425
I'm telling you, it's a constant battle.

00:38:22.455 --> 00:38:22.885
It really is.

00:38:23.155 --> 00:38:28.815
Because there's always a roof leak or a
car breakdown or arick neck that's gonna

00:38:28.815 --> 00:38:32.595
show up, that's gonna say, Hey, no, you
need to be down and out for that one.

00:38:32.595 --> 00:38:33.735
You need to be down and out for that one.

00:38:34.335 --> 00:38:38.025
You don't need to trust the Lord for that
one, and every time you're gonna go, Nope.

00:38:38.175 --> 00:38:39.075
I'm gonna acknowledge.

00:38:39.885 --> 00:38:42.225
I'm gonna recognize God has done
it before and he will do it again.

00:38:42.225 --> 00:38:43.515
I loved praising today.

00:38:43.515 --> 00:38:44.715
Thank you, Matt, for leading us worship.

00:38:44.895 --> 00:38:48.345
I loved praising today
because he has the same God.

00:38:48.585 --> 00:38:50.145
He has the same God.

00:38:50.955 --> 00:38:52.065
He has the same God.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.085
Oh man, I need to hear that today.

00:38:54.285 --> 00:38:59.565
He's the same God for you as he
was for me as he was for Jeremiah.

00:38:59.565 --> 00:39:01.305
Let's read the last couple of verses here.

00:39:01.455 --> 00:39:03.825
Lamentations 3 24 through 26.

00:39:03.944 --> 00:39:04.785
Here's what it says.

00:39:04.935 --> 00:39:06.645
I say, the Lord is my portion.

00:39:06.645 --> 00:39:10.125
Therefore, I will put my hope
in him, not his circumstances.

00:39:10.125 --> 00:39:10.935
I wanna say this again.

00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:12.705
It is in Jesus we put our hope.

00:39:12.964 --> 00:39:18.795
The Lord is good to those who wait
for him, to the person who seeks him.

00:39:19.455 --> 00:39:22.665
It is good to wait quietly
for salvation from the Lord.

00:39:23.595 --> 00:39:23.955
Amen.

00:39:24.975 --> 00:39:25.335
Amen.

00:39:25.665 --> 00:39:27.375
Now, does it seem that simple?

00:39:27.915 --> 00:39:29.685
Because at the beginning,
remember the verse I read to you?

00:39:29.685 --> 00:39:33.705
Anxiety in the heart of man causes
depression, but a good word makes it glad.

00:39:35.265 --> 00:39:39.195
Maybe, maybe for you, there's a good word
that we're learning today from Jeremiah's

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.925
story, A man after God, and he literally
spoke the words of God and he began to.

00:39:45.855 --> 00:39:50.955
Being struggle, but he began to remember
and he really began to praise and know

00:39:51.075 --> 00:39:53.175
that the Lord was going to be faithful.

00:39:53.805 --> 00:39:58.515
I'm praying today was a good word for
you for, for wherever you are, for maybe

00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.895
your friend that you're gonna go talk to.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.455
Maybe this word was for them.

00:40:01.455 --> 00:40:02.415
Maybe it's for you.

00:40:02.805 --> 00:40:03.375
Take it home.

00:40:03.375 --> 00:40:07.335
Save it because it may be for you in
a year or in two years when you're

00:40:07.335 --> 00:40:12.465
going through one of those behavioral
or situational or just whatever it

00:40:12.465 --> 00:40:14.145
is that's causing the depression.

00:40:14.895 --> 00:40:16.275
So how are we gonna fight our battles?

00:40:16.275 --> 00:40:18.225
I'm just gonna remind you,
prayer is so important.

00:40:18.855 --> 00:40:20.175
How do we fight our battles?

00:40:21.255 --> 00:40:23.835
You know how our church fought the
battles that I just shared with

00:40:23.835 --> 00:40:27.465
you earlier, the crick neck, the
broken down car, and the roof leak?

00:40:28.875 --> 00:40:30.195
They dragged me.

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:31.845
I know this sounds funny.

00:40:31.845 --> 00:40:33.225
I was up studying the message.

00:40:33.285 --> 00:40:34.845
They dragged me into a circle.

00:40:34.845 --> 00:40:36.405
They put their hands on me
and they prayed over me.

00:40:37.515 --> 00:40:38.384
That's how we fight our battles.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:40.785
Am I healed right now?

00:40:40.785 --> 00:40:41.715
My neck's still pretty sore.

00:40:42.495 --> 00:40:45.525
My car may overheat when I drive
home, and I still gotta get

00:40:45.525 --> 00:40:46.575
the roof fix when I get home.

00:40:47.115 --> 00:40:52.575
But I'll just tell you this, I'm
so thankful for them because on

00:40:52.575 --> 00:40:55.515
the other side of their prayer
was a breath of fresh wind.

00:40:58.965 --> 00:40:59.775
God is good.

00:41:00.645 --> 00:41:01.965
God has given us a good word.

00:41:03.135 --> 00:41:06.435
God has given us a good community of
people to remind us that he is good.

00:41:07.365 --> 00:41:09.734
So, That's what we're
gonna do in invitation.

00:41:09.975 --> 00:41:14.205
So as we start invitation, I
always explain this, what is

00:41:14.205 --> 00:41:15.015
the purpose of invitation?

00:41:15.015 --> 00:41:19.475
I'm telling you I've been in churches
just so you know, as a pastor  I

00:41:19.535 --> 00:41:23.654
typically would always sit in services
cuz I, I was, you know, saved at one

00:41:23.654 --> 00:41:26.685
point late in my life and, and sat
under our services and I'm like, what's

00:41:26.685 --> 00:41:28.395
the point of invitation like that?

00:41:28.634 --> 00:41:31.214
Just go into this thing and they expect
me to close my eyes and do something.

00:41:31.815 --> 00:41:32.745
Anybody ever feel that way?

00:41:33.285 --> 00:41:36.525
Like there's music going and I'm
like sitting here going, I guess

00:41:36.525 --> 00:41:37.484
that's what everybody else is doing.

00:41:37.484 --> 00:41:37.694
I'm gonna.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.810
Okay.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.130
Why do I make fun of that?

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:42.570
It's not, it's not their fault.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.330
It's because we assume everybody
understands what invitation is.

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:48.480
Invitation is an opportunity
to invite you to respond to the

00:41:48.485 --> 00:41:53.220
message, to respond to, to Jesus.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.790
And what we mean by this is, is
you could easily hear this message

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.060
today and not put on the white belt.

00:42:00.065 --> 00:42:00.930
You get what I'm saying?

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:02.010
Does anybody hear what I'm saying here?

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.470
You could leave here today and
not put on that white belt.

00:42:05.025 --> 00:42:06.855
I don't have a white belt
out here to hand you.

00:42:06.855 --> 00:42:07.185
Okay?

00:42:07.185 --> 00:42:07.965
Figuratively.

00:42:08.835 --> 00:42:09.045
Okay.

00:42:09.045 --> 00:42:10.725
But you need to put on a white belt.

00:42:11.145 --> 00:42:12.105
That's what invitation is.

00:42:12.105 --> 00:42:15.194
Every single week, when I say we're
gonna have invitation, I want you to

00:42:15.194 --> 00:42:16.815
think I'm putting on the white belt.

00:42:16.815 --> 00:42:20.475
I'm taking what I've heard, and I'm
gonna begin to say, I'm taking one step.

00:42:20.685 --> 00:42:21.105
One step.

00:42:22.154 --> 00:42:25.335
Do you know that a white belt
is given after just signing up?

00:42:26.384 --> 00:42:28.005
You don't e You don't
even have to earn it.

00:42:28.005 --> 00:42:29.505
And here's the cool part, it's Kevin.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:33.540
And you know what signing up means when
we give our lives to Jesus, and this

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.330
is where for some of you that's never
given your life to Jesus, if you've never

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:42.090
given your life to Jesus, if you've never
surrendered your life to Jesus, do you

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:43.710
know that Jesus gives you that white belt?

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.600
He gives it to you.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.130
You don't have to earn it.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:55.380
Jesus has done all the work on the
cross to forgive you of your sins.

00:42:56.145 --> 00:42:59.445
And to say you can be brand
new to give your life to him.

00:42:59.715 --> 00:43:02.175
So during this time of invitation,
if you need to give your life

00:43:02.175 --> 00:43:04.935
to Jesus, you come find me.

00:43:04.935 --> 00:43:05.895
I'm gonna be in the back.

00:43:06.735 --> 00:43:09.675
During this time, I want
you to just also surrender.

00:43:10.155 --> 00:43:12.185
I want you to surrender everything
that you're walking through.

00:43:13.275 --> 00:43:17.145
Let's just begin to pray, and then
we're gonna walk through a few things.

00:43:17.145 --> 00:43:19.334
Lord Jesus, you are good.

00:43:19.334 --> 00:43:22.605
You are God, and we are
not, and we trust you, Lord.

00:43:22.605 --> 00:43:26.024
I think many of us in this
room can relate with Jeremiah.

00:43:26.029 --> 00:43:28.305
We wonder, Lord, what are you doing?

00:43:29.955 --> 00:43:31.245
But Lord, then we remember.

00:43:33.075 --> 00:43:33.555
We remember.

00:43:33.555 --> 00:43:35.774
So, Lord, I just pray right now
that you're ministering to the

00:43:35.774 --> 00:43:37.064
hearts of those in this room.

00:43:37.365 --> 00:43:41.194
They're dealing with depression,
anxiety, worry, burnout.

00:43:41.564 --> 00:43:42.464
I don't know what it is.

00:43:42.734 --> 00:43:43.725
Whatever they're dealing with, Lord.

00:43:44.085 --> 00:43:48.555
May you begin to minister to
them as we continue to pray.

00:43:48.555 --> 00:43:50.805
Here's what my challenge to you,
those of you that are sitting

00:43:50.805 --> 00:43:53.505
there, I'm not asking you to sit
there and wonder what's going on.

00:43:53.505 --> 00:43:56.835
I want you right there to begin to
acknowledge your feelings before the

00:43:56.835 --> 00:44:02.245
Lord begin to just cast them to the
Lord and say, Lord, I feel depressed.

00:44:03.904 --> 00:44:06.924
Say maybe I am exhausted.

00:44:10.605 --> 00:44:11.475
Be honest.

00:44:12.765 --> 00:44:16.455
Remember, your feelings are valid,
but they're only temporary right now.

00:44:16.695 --> 00:44:17.535
I'm just gonna give you a minute.

00:44:18.195 --> 00:44:20.985
Just begin to cast those to the
Lord and be honest with him today.

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.610
All right, so we're gonna
continue to pray, but this

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:51.630
is now what I want you to do.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.800
Here's my challenge.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:57.740
Now that you have acknowledged and
been honest before the Lord, here's

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:01.470
what I want you to acknowledge, that
your feelings are not permanent.

00:45:03.149 --> 00:45:05.910
I want you to just pray and begin to
acknowledge before the Lord that they're

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:10.529
not permanent and you're asking the
Lord to fight your battle for you.

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:16.319
So right now, say, okay, Lord, everything
I just shared, like they're valid.

00:45:17.279 --> 00:45:18.270
They're not permanent, Lord.

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:19.560
And so they're, they're yours.

00:45:20.149 --> 00:45:22.319
So just give it over the
Lord and just start handing.

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:26.910
If you can imagine taking
stress in your hand and handing

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:28.080
it to the Lord, do it now.

00:45:29.819 --> 00:45:34.230
Maybe you take anger, you have it
in your hand, and you hand it to the

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:35.490
Lord and you say, Lord, it's yours.

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:43.259
Whatever it is, hand it to him.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:46.480
It's not yours to fight.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:47.400
It's his.

00:45:48.569 --> 00:45:49.560
He's already won the battle.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:50.940
Give it to him.

00:46:07.395 --> 00:46:10.455
And the last thing, as we continue
to pray, those of you that have

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:14.895
heard me share that maybe your next
step is to give your life to Jesus.

00:46:14.895 --> 00:46:20.745
Here is my challenge today that
you don't leave today before

00:46:21.045 --> 00:46:22.875
surrendering your life to Jesus.

00:46:23.775 --> 00:46:27.615
See, Jeremiah had a hope in God
because he had a relationship with God.

00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:33.405
Every one of us can have a hope in God
if we have a relationship with Jesus,

00:46:34.425 --> 00:46:37.065
but if you walked in here without that
relationship, you can walk out with it.

00:46:38.175 --> 00:46:40.335
So here's my challenge in just a moment.

00:46:40.605 --> 00:46:43.575
If you wanna give your life to
Jesus, I just want you to be bold.

00:46:44.775 --> 00:46:47.595
I am telling you we need to be
more bold in the days ahead.

00:46:47.895 --> 00:46:52.275
We need to stop just and realize
that God wants to see our boldness.

00:46:52.575 --> 00:46:56.205
And so right now, if you're in this
room and you wanna give your life to

00:46:56.205 --> 00:46:59.325
Jesus, my challenge to you right now
is to raise your hand so we can pray

00:46:59.325 --> 00:47:02.025
with you and encourage you in your
faith if you need to give your life

00:47:02.025 --> 00:47:06.855
to Jesus, to just raise your hand
and say, I need Jesus to surrender

00:47:06.855 --> 00:47:09.615
my life to be forgiven of my sins.

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:15.840
All right.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.650
This is a reminder of me.

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:17.580
Thank you for raising your hand.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.790
There is people in this room that are
ready to give their lives to Jesus,

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:22.050
and I don't want us to pray alone.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:23.520
So we're gonna pray together.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:29.040
Those of who, who want to give your
life to Jesus, just repeat with me

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.150
and I want everybody to repeat me.

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.140
You don't pray alone.

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:37.500
So Lord Jesus, forgive me
of my sins, change my life.

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:40.590
Go with me.

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:45.330
Fight my battles, change my life.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.460
God, we believe in you.

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:49.650
And we trust you.

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:51.630
In Jesus' name.

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:53.190
Amen.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:55.770
Let's celebrate with
God is changing lives.

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:59.850
And I pray today as we continue
to worship, as we continue

00:47:59.855 --> 00:48:02.460
to worship, don't hold back.

00:48:03.345 --> 00:48:05.775
Begin to praise God for
what he's going to do.

00:48:05.775 --> 00:48:07.754
Remember what we did
a couple of weeks ago?

00:48:08.025 --> 00:48:08.745
We prayed.

00:48:08.835 --> 00:48:09.825
We've done that this morning.

00:48:10.545 --> 00:48:11.295
We've paused.

00:48:11.295 --> 00:48:14.325
I hope you've paused and
reflected that God can work.

00:48:14.865 --> 00:48:15.105
Now.

00:48:15.134 --> 00:48:16.964
Praise, even if the battle's not one.

00:48:17.565 --> 00:48:19.975
I want you to continue today to praise.

00:48:20.154 --> 00:48:22.424
If anybody needs some prayer,
I'm gonna be over in the corner

00:48:22.424 --> 00:48:25.754
during the time of invitation, so
let's stand and worship together.
