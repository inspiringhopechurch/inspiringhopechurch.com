00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.630
Paul is in Rome.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.910
He's in prison, and he knows
that his life is almost over.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.880
That's the context now in which we read.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.140
He looks back on God's goodness
to him, and he looks forward

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.970
to the dangers and the hope.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.740
The Lord stood by me, gave me strength
to proclaim the message fully.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:33.585
All right.

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:36.375
Well, it is great to see
everybody this morning.

00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:39.915
Super pumped to be able to
jump back into the word of God.

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:44.805
We have been in the book of second
Timothy, um, not for as long as we

00:00:44.805 --> 00:00:47.745
were in first Timothy, but we're
still walking through this slowly.

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:52.004
Uh, and so if you have your Bibles with
you, go ahead and turn to second Timothy.

00:00:52.394 --> 00:00:55.305
Uh, chapter two, we're gonna
be starting in verse 14.

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:59.745
Um, but want to kind of catch everybody
up cuz I know that people are in

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:01.785
and out and some of you may be new.

00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:04.095
So be able to catch you up on
what we've been walking through.

00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:08.335
But in the book of second Timothy,
what we have learned is this is

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:13.435
a letter from Paul the Apostle to
his true son in the faith Timothy.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.185
And we, we consistently talk through this,
so make sure everybody understands this.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.164
This understanding is, this is what is
known as Paul's last letter to Timothy,

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:23.875
uh, towards the end of his life.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:26.845
And so these words in which
Paul would be sharing to Timothy

00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:28.585
would be important words.

00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:30.775
You know, we think about this as
if somebody was on their death.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.050
What are the last few words that
you would wanna share with someone?

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.750
And so Paul's thinking in this
idea of these maybe the last

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.680
words that I share with Timothy.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.340
Now he's inviting Timothy to come see
him in prison, but if he doesn't make it,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.110
these are important words that he hears.

00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:46.620
And so because of this, uh,
these words are pretty direct.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.320
And so Paul's really trying
to encourage Timothy.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.050
He's trying to remind
Timothy of how much one.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.509
Their relationship was right, how
much he loved him, but also for

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.110
Timothy, uh, to build him up and give
him encouragement because Timothy

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.039
would know that he is getting this
letter, uh, from Paul in prison.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.979
And so Paul's not just getting this, you
know, writing this letter in prison and

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.210
saying, Hey, you go do whatever you want.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.510
But he's actually challenging
Timothy to come and suffer with Paul.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.609
And so this idea that, that Timothy's
receiving this letter and this and

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:19.269
this place is saying, Hey, you want
me to come and, and like suffer with

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.990
you, Like maybe to the point of.

00:02:22.095 --> 00:02:23.625
That could be a little bit scary.

00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:26.565
That could be a little bit,
obviously from my standpoint, do I

00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:27.645
really wanna receive this letter?

00:02:27.645 --> 00:02:28.665
Do I wanna open it?

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:34.785
But Paul knew that God had gifted
Timothy to, to, to receive this message

00:02:34.785 --> 00:02:37.695
and to be able to be encouraged to
share with other people as well.

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:41.835
And so we recently have covered this in
the, in chapter two, this idea behind.

00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:45.555
Now Paul challenged Timothy to
take all the things that Paul

00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:47.205
had taught Timothy in his life.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.820
And to share this with faithful
people who will take that same message

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.960
and share it with faithful people.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.850
And that idea of faithfulness is so
important because faithful people are

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.780
people who will obviously take whatever's
given to them and be consistent,

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:03.670
will actually show up and do it.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.540
And so Paul, knowing this is
sharing this with Timothy and

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.800
Timothy, here's the cool part.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.850
The moment that we get to read this
letter, we are now the faithful people.

00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:17.655
That has been entrusted with this message,
and that may seem weighty to you, like, Oh

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.815
man, like I'm entrusted with this message.

00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:20.685
What am I supposed to do with it?

00:03:20.685 --> 00:03:24.045
The cool part is that as a
church, as a body of believers,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.725
we get to do this together.

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:29.795
We get to encourage one another
together to walk in this until.

00:03:30.055 --> 00:03:30.805
Learn this.

00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:34.315
And so we are obviously walking
through this book to understand that

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:38.485
together and to learn, and we get
to be in a part of a text today that

00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:40.645
anybody in here ever go to AANAs.

00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:42.145
I don't know how many people know AANAs.

00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:44.365
We got one, maybe 2, 3, 4.

00:03:44.665 --> 00:03:44.815
Okay.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.995
If you've ever been in AANAs,
you probably memorized.

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:51.135
One of these verses here,
it talks about the workman.

00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:54.945
And, uh, I remember my, uh, the music
minister was part of our last church.

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:58.035
He would repeat this to me all the
time because he grew up in AANAs.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.435
And I'll read the verse here in
just a little bit, but a workman

00:04:00.435 --> 00:04:02.204
that that presents himself to God.

00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:04.725
And, uh, it's a really cool verse.

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:07.484
But what we may hear today, and this
is something I really wanna encourage

00:04:07.484 --> 00:04:11.415
him before we jump off into the text,
what you may hear today is something

00:04:11.415 --> 00:04:14.155
where you look around and you go,
But we don't deal with this in our.

00:04:14.864 --> 00:04:16.185
We don't deal with this in our lives.

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:20.565
There's going to be things that you
hear that are for preparation, right?

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:23.765
You, you, and you'll hear this
word, remember, we need to

00:04:23.965 --> 00:04:25.005
remember them when we need it.

00:04:25.605 --> 00:04:27.735
For some of you, you're gonna
hear these verses today and you're

00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:30.105
gonna go, Yep, I've been a part
of a church that's been this way.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.164
I've been around other believers, or maybe
even yourself, has been one of these.

00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:35.805
And so in these moments, we're gonna
have a lot of things that we can take.

00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:37.365
So hopefully you'll draw into this.

00:04:37.664 --> 00:04:38.715
But I wanna start with this.

00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:40.094
Has anybody ever.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.000
Went to go do something and on the
way to go do it, you got distracted

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.280
by something else and then you forgot
what you were supposed to go do.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.530
Anybody, I'm guessing most of
y'all are pretty similar to me.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.280
It has to do a lot with even housework
cuz I went to go get the broom to go

00:04:56.285 --> 00:04:59.670
sweep upstairs and on the way down I
saw covers that were on the floor that

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.940
my kids left there and I'm like, ugh.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.740
So then I start folding the covers
and I put them up and then I stand

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.120
there for about five minutes.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.140
What was I going.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.960
We forget, and so when we think about this
idea of forgetting, we get distracted.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.090
And so we're gonna hear this message
today from Paul to Timothy to not get

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.680
distracted from our calling as Christ
followers, to not get distracted.

00:05:24.465 --> 00:05:28.065
From what God has called us
to do and these distractions

00:05:28.065 --> 00:05:29.505
we'll hear more about today.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.655
So, uh, if you don't have your Bibles,
we will have the text up here today.

00:05:32.655 --> 00:05:35.145
Again, second Timothy chapter
two, starting in verse 14.

00:05:35.145 --> 00:05:36.305
We're just gonna read through 18.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.155
So here's what it says.

00:05:37.485 --> 00:05:43.215
Remind them of these things and charge
them before God not to fight about words.

00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:47.505
This is useless and leads
to the run of those who.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.520
Be diligent to present yourself
to God as one approved.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.210
A worker who didn't, does not
need to be ashamed, correctly,

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.680
Teaching the word of truth.

00:05:57.739 --> 00:05:59.630
Now that's the verse that
you would've learned in Iana.

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:01.099
And then it says this.

00:06:01.104 --> 00:06:03.590
It says, Avoid irreverent,
and empty speech.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.135
Since those who engage in it will,
um, Uh, produce even more Goli, uh,

00:06:09.165 --> 00:06:14.325
Godlessness and their teaching will
spread like gang Green Haen and, uh,

00:06:14.385 --> 00:06:19.245
PHUs are among them and they have
departed from the truth, saying that

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:24.225
the resurrection has already taken
place and are running the faith of some.

00:06:25.005 --> 00:06:25.665
So let's pray.

00:06:26.265 --> 00:06:30.015
Lord Jesus, we just pray, Lord, that
you take this word, you take our hearts,

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:31.665
Lord, and you open 'em up to this word.

00:06:31.665 --> 00:06:36.045
Lord, I pray that if we can, uh, take this
and begin to apply to our lives, Lord, to

00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:39.075
remember, um, how important your word is.

00:06:39.075 --> 00:06:43.125
Lord, I pray that we don't leave out here
unchanged, Lord, but we continue to use

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:46.845
your word as a light, uh, to our path,
Lord, and a lamp unto, unto our feet.

00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:48.675
And so, Lord, we just pray
this in your headly name.

00:06:50.715 --> 00:06:54.885
So the word remind is the first word
that you'll see here, and that we

00:06:54.885 --> 00:06:58.755
actually talked a little bit about
this last week about the word remember.

00:06:58.755 --> 00:07:00.855
And I finally, as I began to talk
more and more about, remember,

00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:04.065
and I challenged you, I said,
Hey, take your Bible one year.

00:07:05.085 --> 00:07:06.075
And read through it.

00:07:06.075 --> 00:07:09.285
And your whole purpose is to underline
the word remember, or remind or

00:07:09.285 --> 00:07:13.515
something that is obviously within
that same context, underline that and

00:07:13.515 --> 00:07:14.655
see how many times it's in the Bible.

00:07:14.655 --> 00:07:19.245
Well then I finally decided to go
study it 550 times in the Bible

00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:23.145
with the variations included of that
word, remember, is in the Bible.

00:07:23.805 --> 00:07:25.005
So I wanna ask this question.

00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:30.315
Why do you think that Remember
is in the Bible that many times,

00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:33.825
anybody, that's how much we.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.960
We can all relate with forgetting.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.280
Uh, if, if you're anything like me,
since I have been on staff now at at

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.760
a church for about 10 years, one of
my early jobs as an administrative

00:07:44.765 --> 00:07:49.620
assistant for my pastor was to do
things, was to remember things for him.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.410
I would literally stand around
him as he had conversations with

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.770
people and when they would ask him
a question and he needed to respond

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.000
to it, I was usually taking notes.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.620
And I actually got to a point where
I think I have accomplished over

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.390
10,000 tasks in min ministry on my
reminder app, on my phone, 10,000.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.480
That may be even under,
because sometimes I use notes.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.680
My notes is full as well.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:15.510
So all of us are driven with this idea
of remember because why We easily forget.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.330
So Paul knows this, that just the human
idea that all of us tend to forget.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.240
And so the word remember is so important.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.830
That's why God even challenges us.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.940
That's why the Bible challenges.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.240
This is why I challenge you, that
we need to be spending time in

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.030
God's word every day, because
at times we forget what it says.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.220
So he says, Remember right.

00:08:35.325 --> 00:08:36.975
To remind them of these things.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:40.875
What things has he already said to Paul
or to, to us in this text, he's always

00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:43.665
saying to remind them of these things,
but also remind them of these things

00:08:43.665 --> 00:08:44.535
that we're gonna talk about today.

00:08:44.535 --> 00:08:49.215
So the first thing he says is to
remember and to avoid disputing over

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.285
words, to avoid disputing over words.

00:08:51.285 --> 00:08:54.255
So when we dispute over words in
the church, it distractions from the

00:08:54.255 --> 00:08:56.685
mission that God has called us to.

00:08:57.315 --> 00:09:01.065
Um, I, I once heard this story where
these two guys were on the battlefield

00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:03.345
fighting over how they were going.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.100
Defeat their enemy.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.209
They got so frustrated at each other,
they were about to draw swords, and

00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:12.630
somebody finally stops them and says,
Hey, look, turn and look this way.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.150
That's the enemy at times in the
church where all our goal is to,

00:09:18.329 --> 00:09:20.430
to go fulfill the mission that
God has called us to fulfill.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:23.430
And for us as a church, we want
to inspire hope by discovering

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.069
God's purpose for their life
through a relationship with Jesus.

00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:30.870
We wanna continue to help people know
what they were meant and born to be and

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.459
to do through a relationship with Jesus.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.700
And sometimes we get distracted.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.700
And here's what typically happens.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.470
We don't have this in this church, is
typically there's, there's arguments

00:09:39.475 --> 00:09:42.060
over things like carpet color, good news.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:42.870
We don't have carpet color.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.940
We can't argue about that when
we've eliminated that one.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.500
But sometimes we get distracted over
these small things about words, right?

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:53.310
So what words, Non essential words to the
gospel that distract us from the mission.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.020
Things that would get us off the topic
and off the purpose of what God has called

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.730
us to do as a church and as individual.

00:10:00.135 --> 00:10:04.275
Now I could go through a list
of things and uh, obviously we

00:10:04.275 --> 00:10:06.465
all have our different examples,
but I wanna give a couple today.

00:10:06.465 --> 00:10:07.725
But I do wanna mention one thing.

00:10:07.725 --> 00:10:10.305
He says, remind them of these
things and charge them before

00:10:10.305 --> 00:10:12.495
God not to fight about words.

00:10:12.795 --> 00:10:14.055
This is so important.

00:10:14.564 --> 00:10:19.095
We need to be able to have discussions
in our church over things that we have

00:10:19.095 --> 00:10:22.185
issues with each other over differences
of belief, even in the word of God.

00:10:22.185 --> 00:10:24.225
There needs to be conversations
about those things.

00:10:24.225 --> 00:10:25.365
There needs to be a place for it.

00:10:25.365 --> 00:10:25.995
I welcome.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.420
I love it, but what he
said was fighting, right?

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:35.189
Fighting is something that leads us
to causing an argument in the church.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.819
And if you've never been a part of this,
praise God, you haven't been a part of it.

00:10:38.819 --> 00:10:43.770
But there has been arguments in the
church where people get so frustrated

00:10:43.775 --> 00:10:46.589
at the, the disunity in the church that
they don't wanna be a part of that.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.030
And, and it usually even happens
on a Sunday morning in front of

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.740
people who don't even know Jesus.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.310
And they see the church and they see
this disunified church over words or

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:01.890
differences that are non essential to the
gospel and what ends up happening, people

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:02.820
don't wanna be a part of that church.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.860
So Paul's really teaching Timothy
this idea and teaching us this idea

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.150
of don't let our words lead us to
fighting and arguments that obviously

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.220
lead people away from the church.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.630
So let me give you a couple examples.

00:11:15.635 --> 00:11:19.050
So you guys know some things in my
life that I've seen in the church, and

00:11:19.055 --> 00:11:20.640
again, you'll have some as well for you.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.670
For me, this wasn't necessarily words,
but this is something that we did

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.720
in our church and it's so small, but
we had air fresheners in our church.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.390
I mean, I don't know if anybody likes air
fresheners, but if you've ever been in

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.950
an old church, what happens in an old.

00:11:33.224 --> 00:11:34.724
It's musty, kind of stinky.

00:11:35.145 --> 00:11:38.055
So we decided to put Samir first in there
cuz everybody's gonna want the church

00:11:38.055 --> 00:11:40.305
to smell great, except for one person.

00:11:40.724 --> 00:11:44.265
One person didn't like 'em so much
that they refused to attend the

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.425
church service, go inside the church.

00:11:46.635 --> 00:11:50.235
But not only did they refuse to do
that, they would gather a group to

00:11:50.235 --> 00:11:54.735
complain about it so it begin to
make a scene and fight over that.

00:11:54.735 --> 00:11:55.694
Now here is the thing.

00:11:56.625 --> 00:11:58.844
All they had to do was have a
conversation with us when they started

00:11:58.849 --> 00:12:00.224
having a conversation with us on.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.630
We were trying to make some
things, Hey, let's, let's, let's

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.740
bring down some of the smell.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.340
Let's move it around.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.350
Cause they had some breathing stuff
that they were feeling like they were

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.880
bothered with, but it wasn't enough.

00:12:08.885 --> 00:12:13.110
They actually end up causing a scene in
the middle of our lobby with our pastor

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.970
yelling at him over air fresheners.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.880
Now, just so you know, again, I
want everybody to understand, I

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.820
care about whatever air fresheners
are lighting if you have issues,

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.410
but there's a way to go about it.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.260
And these words were not
essential to the gospel.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.359
So let me go a step further.

00:12:27.359 --> 00:12:31.349
This is actually words where me as
a, as a, a new, uh, new believer.

00:12:31.349 --> 00:12:33.000
I say new believer, but new on staff.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.839
A couple years in, my pastors started to
let me have Wednesday nights to teach.

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:39.180
That's where I kind of cut
my teeth on what teaching is.

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:40.500
I don't know if I've learned anything yet.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.829
That's where I started
on Wednesday nights.

00:12:43.219 --> 00:12:47.540
And on Wednesday nights we had a lot
of mature believers, uh, in that group.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.199
And so they had to kind of bear with me
as I learned how to teach God's word.

00:12:51.439 --> 00:12:55.310
But there was one guy, again, this
guy loved our church and loved me,

00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:00.620
but he tend to not only talk about
words that didn't matter in the text,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.430
but he would almost take over the
class and begin teaching the class.

00:13:05.295 --> 00:13:06.165
In place of me.

00:13:06.615 --> 00:13:10.785
And it wasn't over that the, the what I
was teaching was wrong, but that as those

00:13:10.785 --> 00:13:14.115
words, some things he just didn't like
my application or he would begin to take,

00:13:14.235 --> 00:13:17.415
you know, control of things and well,
we ended up pulling him aside and having

00:13:17.415 --> 00:13:19.725
this conversation with him like, there's
a right and a wrong way to do that.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.189
And, uh, come to figure out there were
some people that was, was refusing

00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:25.890
to come to class because of that,
what was happening because he was

00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:30.780
arguing and fighting over or causing a
distraction with words or differences.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.089
We're not talking about key
beliefs on this first part here.

00:13:33.329 --> 00:13:35.790
So those are two examples from me for you.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.949
You may have something else and
maybe you haven't experienced that,

00:13:37.979 --> 00:13:40.290
but because we know it's in the
word, because they've given you

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.270
some examples, it can happen in the.

00:13:43.215 --> 00:13:46.305
So what I would challenge with this,
and this is, this is what I would say

00:13:46.305 --> 00:13:50.835
that the Paul's getting this, is that
we need to understand how to handle our

00:13:50.835 --> 00:13:56.865
differences with words without fighting,
without arguing, coming to one another.

00:13:56.865 --> 00:13:57.285
Right?

00:13:57.495 --> 00:13:59.055
This is what the Bible talks
about coming to one another.

00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:01.905
If we have differences, if we have
disagreements, there's a right and the

00:14:01.935 --> 00:14:03.345
wrong way to do it that honors God.

00:14:03.345 --> 00:14:08.655
And he says this at the end of this
verse, uh, 14, he says, This is useless

00:14:08.895 --> 00:14:12.135
and leads to the run of those who.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.120
Think about it this way.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.890
When you argue in front of your kids,
you're not benefiting your kids.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.140
This is something me and my
wife have tried to work on.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.100
We're not perfect.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.310
Well, we try to have those arguments or
those successions outside of the room.

00:14:26.314 --> 00:14:26.550
Why?

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.170
Because it, it bothers them.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:28.800
It runs them.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.530
And so that's the same thing
in the church when we had these

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:36.000
arguments, um, that they begin to
distract others and influence them.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.200
But we do need to have a
place where we can have open

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.340
discussions about differences of.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.390
And, uh, I think that we know that as this
church, if you've never been a part of

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.040
this church, we do have the open space.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.210
We have that in our small groups.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.460
We have that after service,
even in the middle service.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.330
I'll even ask questions.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.950
I'm fine with talking a
little bit in service.

00:14:52.955 --> 00:14:54.180
That doesn't bother me too much.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.820
Um, but I want us to do
it in an honorable way.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.640
So how do we avoid these disputes?

00:14:59.645 --> 00:15:00.990
How do we avoid these disputes?

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.760
Well, verse 15 tells us this.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.960
He says to this to be diligent, to
present yourselves to God as one

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.620
approved a worker who does not need to
be ashamed, correctly, teaching the.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.430
And so you understand this, yes,
Paul is speaking to Timothy, who

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:20.010
is a leader in the church, but
this text is not just two pastors.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.310
I think it would, you know, you guys
might really enjoy it a lot if I got to

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.900
just preach about how I should only live.

00:15:25.605 --> 00:15:27.615
But luckily the word of God includes us.

00:15:27.615 --> 00:15:28.365
All right?

00:15:28.365 --> 00:15:29.625
I have to lead by example.

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:33.375
So he's teach, he's talking to
all of us when we look at this.

00:15:33.675 --> 00:15:36.885
So his first suggestion is to
not seek the approval of men.

00:15:36.885 --> 00:15:40.395
So think about this when he says this,
he says, Be diligent to present yourself

00:15:40.395 --> 00:15:43.125
to God as one approved not to man.

00:15:44.445 --> 00:15:50.055
I'll just tell you this, most arguments
in the church and in the home are

00:15:50.545 --> 00:15:52.455
somebody trying to prove themselves.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:57.750
Prove their position and they begun begin
to get angry to prove their position.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.730
Well, as we are having discussions in
the church, know that we're trying to

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:07.319
honor God and we're trying to, uh, be
approved by God, not by anybody else.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.079
And so at times when we get in those
arguments, it's because we're trying

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:11.490
to get approval from someone else.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.480
So we do not let need to let
that lead us to be divisive.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.640
And so we, how do we handle disputes?

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.839
This is how we think.

00:16:18.845 --> 00:16:20.230
One, what does God think?

00:16:20.835 --> 00:16:24.015
About what I'm saying and the stance I'm
taking, but two, this is so important.

00:16:24.285 --> 00:16:28.005
Does my attitude in how I'm
handling this reflect a loving,

00:16:28.005 --> 00:16:29.655
compassionate, and understanding heart?

00:16:30.495 --> 00:16:35.055
It's so important for us to reflect on
what God's view of our conversations

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.215
are, but number two, how we handle that.

00:16:37.755 --> 00:16:39.855
And then he talks about this
in order to know what God

00:16:39.855 --> 00:16:41.295
thinks we need to be a workman.

00:16:42.405 --> 00:16:43.305
How many of y'all work?

00:16:44.175 --> 00:16:45.645
We all understand how to work.

00:16:45.645 --> 00:16:46.215
That's great.

00:16:46.395 --> 00:16:48.915
We work hard, we, we do things.

00:16:49.275 --> 00:16:52.275
Um, why do we do those things
so that we can do them well or

00:16:52.275 --> 00:16:53.715
so we can learn well, right?

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.325
If you don't do your job well, you
probably don't have a job here.

00:16:56.505 --> 00:16:56.865
Right?

00:16:56.865 --> 00:16:59.955
So understanding the idea behind
a workman, he's saying, working

00:17:00.255 --> 00:17:01.755
to know what the truth is.

00:17:02.025 --> 00:17:08.175
As we begin to have discussions in our
church, if, think about this, if every one

00:17:08.175 --> 00:17:12.015
of us are seeking to get God's approval,
if every one of us are seeking God's.

00:17:13.215 --> 00:17:17.235
Then we will have the ability to handle
these disagreements in a godly way.

00:17:17.565 --> 00:17:20.985
Doesn't mean maybe we have the same belief
or the same agreement on the, in the

00:17:20.985 --> 00:17:22.575
end, the carpet color can be red or blue.

00:17:22.575 --> 00:17:25.485
Maybe we don't come to the same
agreement, but we can do it in a civil.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:27.389
Way, Right, A civil way.

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:32.310
So it's important to know this, that
Paul is talking to Timothy about

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:36.870
people in the church cuz we do have
disagreements with people outside the

00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:37.800
church when we be outside the church.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.560
People who don't know Christ and and
maybe have a difference of belief there.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.110
And again, I think we still
handle that very similar way.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.800
But he is talking about people in the
church and that's why you may look

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.540
around and go, But I love these people.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.160
I would never have an argument.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.340
Well for now, but we said that as well.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.680
Me and my wife, for the first
year we were dating, we didn't

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.300
have one fight for the first year.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.870
Now we've had a lot of those
we've made up for that first year.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:01.200
Right?

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.860
Because we wouldn't have expected
some disagreements, right?

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.040
So we are really preparing ourselves
if we haven't experienced that.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.280
So that's how important it
is for us to look at this.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.985
And then the last thing he says
here, Be diligent to present yourself

00:18:14.985 --> 00:18:16.695
to God to be approved by him.

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:20.685
A worker does not need to be ashamed
because he's worked at seeking the word

00:18:20.685 --> 00:18:23.325
of God correctly, teaching the word.

00:18:24.195 --> 00:18:25.095
Here's just a challenge.

00:18:25.095 --> 00:18:31.695
This is a side note to this, correctly
teaching the word, sometimes we

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.395
start teaching on things or we
start having disagreements on things

00:18:34.395 --> 00:18:36.075
of things we don't fully know.

00:18:36.405 --> 00:18:38.055
So D, does anybody like having an.

00:18:40.275 --> 00:18:41.205
Y'all like having an answer.

00:18:41.205 --> 00:18:42.585
If somebody says, Hey, what should we do?

00:18:42.585 --> 00:18:43.335
You like having an answer.

00:18:43.335 --> 00:18:44.145
You like having an opinion.

00:18:44.925 --> 00:18:46.215
We had a deacon at my past church.

00:18:46.215 --> 00:18:48.975
It was the same way we had, he was
on our, our building committee.

00:18:49.185 --> 00:18:52.605
He always had a solution to fix
our building, and we're like,

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:53.475
Where did you get that from?

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:53.955
I don't know.

00:18:53.955 --> 00:18:57.075
I just had a, So he always had an
answer at times when we're having

00:18:57.075 --> 00:18:58.155
some of these disagreements.

00:18:58.515 --> 00:19:00.705
Don't think you always
have to have an answer.

00:19:01.035 --> 00:19:05.655
Don't always like, if you don't fully know
the word of God in this situation or how

00:19:05.655 --> 00:19:07.905
to handle the situation, take a step back.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.110
Be humble in the situation.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.400
Go seek the Lord.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.410
Come back and have the conversation.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.670
If you have not had that conversation
with me at all where we've talked about

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.720
biblical things or even decisions we make
in the church, you'll tend to hear me

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.850
come in and go, You know I'm listening.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.950
Let me take a time to reflect.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.780
Let me seek the Lord in this situation.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.970
I've handled that a lot better than just
pressing back and just trying to always

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:37.800
be right or always have an answer, because
leaders that always have answers probably.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.690
Aren't truly listening.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.290
I would say this, we, we need to be
prepared, but we need to also listen.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:47.010
And so it's just a idea when we think
about this, having the word of God, making

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.900
sure that we know what the truth is.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.760
So I want you to think of this, right?

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.600
He says to remember to avoid
a disputing over words.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:00.930
And let's flip this focus on affirming our
beliefs and what we agree on the truths.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.460
So then he moves on, right?

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.850
Remember now avoid ungodly discussions.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.110
This is where we see in verse 16 and 17.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.400
So he says, Avoid
irreverent and empty speech.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:16.530
Since those hidden engagement in it
will produce even more godlessness.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.630
So let's talk about this.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.380
Ungodly discussions, Ungodly discussions.

00:20:23.129 --> 00:20:25.139
Most of us, if I asked
you, raise your hand.

00:20:25.139 --> 00:20:27.690
If you've been an ungodly discussion,
you probably wouldn't raise your hand.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.440
But ungodly discussions are discussions
that are things that are against the will

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:36.300
of God, things that would lead us to sin,
things that would lead us to not honor

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.100
God and distract us from the mission.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.460
So to avoid means to
not even get involved.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.290
Don't join the discussion.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:48.510
If you see it walk away, and I
just know this as we talk about

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.220
this, we're getting ready to talk
about what they actually had.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.379
Some differences of
belief, these two guys.

00:20:52.875 --> 00:20:54.825
We're part of this Ungod list discussion.

00:20:55.155 --> 00:20:57.345
They had a difference of
belief in resurrection.

00:20:58.245 --> 00:20:59.925
Well, should they have
been able to talk about it?

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:00.345
Yes.

00:21:00.345 --> 00:21:02.715
Should they have been
able to explore that idea?

00:21:02.715 --> 00:21:03.315
If they had that?

00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:04.754
Yes, they should have.

00:21:05.115 --> 00:21:10.514
But what they did was they begin to
even lead out as leaders and begin to

00:21:10.514 --> 00:21:12.465
influence the church in a negative way.

00:21:12.915 --> 00:21:17.565
And so I know this, if you've ever
been around people that have had

00:21:17.565 --> 00:21:20.175
discussions, you ever been in a circle
and all of a sudden somebody brings up.

00:21:21.014 --> 00:21:23.865
A complaint or they bring
up something that's wrong.

00:21:24.615 --> 00:21:27.014
You just felt like, Should
I leave the situation?

00:21:27.014 --> 00:21:28.035
Should I join in?

00:21:28.365 --> 00:21:29.145
What should I do?

00:21:29.145 --> 00:21:30.555
How, how should I avoid this?

00:21:30.945 --> 00:21:36.285
Well, we've gotta find ways as a church
to avoid these discussions, not, not

00:21:36.675 --> 00:21:38.504
affirm them, not allow them to happen.

00:21:38.504 --> 00:21:41.795
And again, I guys, I know you may be
saying, Hey, this really sounds like a

00:21:41.795 --> 00:21:44.895
lot of fun, great things to go apply to
ourselves if, if this isn't something

00:21:44.895 --> 00:21:45.675
that we're dealing with, praise.

00:21:46.515 --> 00:21:49.935
But we need to know how to handle
as things like this will arise.

00:21:49.935 --> 00:21:50.745
Guess what?

00:21:51.705 --> 00:21:56.025
The more people that come into this room
and be a part of our church all come

00:21:56.025 --> 00:21:57.495
with different spiritual backgrounds.

00:21:57.615 --> 00:22:02.205
I'm learning that more and more as a
pastor from Oklahoma than I've ever

00:22:02.205 --> 00:22:05.835
understood because in Oklahoma it seemed
like they were just Southern Baptist.

00:22:05.835 --> 00:22:07.665
It just felt like we
just knew who we were.

00:22:07.695 --> 00:22:08.085
Right?

00:22:08.475 --> 00:22:10.965
But the more I come to Ohio,
nothing against Ohio, I'm just

00:22:10.965 --> 00:22:12.915
telling you, I'm just, I have been.

00:22:13.919 --> 00:22:17.639
From a belief standpoint,
challenged on all levels and in

00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:19.980
a good way, a healthy way, right?

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.470
As I got to seek the word
and truly see what it says.

00:22:23.159 --> 00:22:28.020
But the more people that we involve, the
more that we will see the opportunity

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.960
in a bad way for godless discussions.

00:22:31.515 --> 00:22:34.725
Things that don't honor God,
Things that are against God's word,

00:22:34.725 --> 00:22:37.785
that will get discussed and then
affirmed and then begin to cause.

00:22:37.935 --> 00:22:39.885
Well, what do we hear
that happens in churches?

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.345
I know this, I've heard in
Hamilton there's a lot of churches

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:44.535
that got planted out of splits.

00:22:45.765 --> 00:22:46.845
Not, not a good way.

00:22:47.205 --> 00:22:51.045
So we, we wanna make sure that we are a
healthy church that's keeping the word of

00:22:51.045 --> 00:22:55.545
God the main focus, the mission of God,
the main focus, not these outside things.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.860
And so, um, when we think about this,
it's, it's an op opportunity I think for

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:06.090
us when we think about the differences of
our backgrounds to learn from one another.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:11.730
But in some cases, this can bring about,
uh, ungodly discussions that can lead

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.220
people away from their faith, right?

00:23:14.225 --> 00:23:17.040
To create disunity in the
church and stir up controversy.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.630
Paul was saying, if we get involved in
these things, it's going to escalate,

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:22.920
escalate to something horrible.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.730
What is that?

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.310
He uses verse 17.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.290
This is very, very clear, and
I, I, again, studying more

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.850
about this, I'm just like, Wow.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.320
But he says in verse 17, he says,
And they're teaching this Ungod list.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.960
Teaching will spread like gang green.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.430
Anybody know what gang green is?

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.080
Okay.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.640
Couple people, maybe some of y'all don't.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.230
Like I watched the movie over it once.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.010
It's weird.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:44.670
Like weird.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.120
Okay.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.050
It's something that spreads fast.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.990
It's also something that stinks.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:59.370
Whenever ungodly conversations are
happening in the church, it's going to

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.550
stink it and it will spread quickly.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:06.389
This is Paul, like, I know sometimes
we don't wanna hear this, but

00:24:06.389 --> 00:24:08.129
we have to protect ourselves.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.510
We have to be aware.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.100
These things happen in our church.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.639
We're here to learn from one
another to prevent things.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:16.020
Just like this.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:19.380
I'll just give you guys a great example
and just wanna help continue to apply

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.020
this within mine and my wife's marriage.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:23.370
We always wanna continue to discuss.

00:24:23.375 --> 00:24:23.970
We love each other.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:24.870
We're gonna be married forever.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:28.800
We always wanna discuss the opportunities
in which we place ourselves in

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:33.870
positions where we could be prone to
wander, prone to be, uh, unfaithful.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:34.710
And you may say what?

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:35.430
You would never do that.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.510
How would even a pastor even talk?

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:37.380
He's gonna be faithful.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.730
No, no.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:39.240
What are we doing?

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.150
We're preparing in the good seasons to
say, Hey, you shouldn't be alone with.

00:24:43.005 --> 00:24:46.665
You should make sure you avoid
these unfruitful conversations or

00:24:46.665 --> 00:24:48.045
to have deeper conversations here.

00:24:48.225 --> 00:24:48.885
Why?

00:24:48.975 --> 00:24:51.555
To protect ourselves to know when
we get in those situations that

00:24:51.555 --> 00:24:57.165
we avoid them for the sake of not
obviously breaking the relationship.

00:24:57.525 --> 00:25:01.725
That's a logical one that makes
sense, but the church is a body of

00:25:01.725 --> 00:25:03.945
people that wants to be together.

00:25:04.905 --> 00:25:07.455
We want to fulfill the
mission that God has given us.

00:25:07.515 --> 00:25:11.235
So we wanna avoid these things for
the benefit of the body and the

00:25:11.235 --> 00:25:12.855
mission that God has called us to.

00:25:13.395 --> 00:25:13.755
Right?

00:25:14.205 --> 00:25:18.345
So why I love being able to, This
is the part where, again, if you,

00:25:18.345 --> 00:25:19.335
you don't know much about it.

00:25:19.335 --> 00:25:20.535
I love asking questions.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.485
You get to be engaged a lot right now.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.905
You ready?

00:25:23.415 --> 00:25:29.565
Why do you believe disputes over words and
ungodly discussions happen in the church?

00:25:40.035 --> 00:25:41.865
I've had time to think about
it, so maybe you guys haven't.

00:25:42.855 --> 00:25:44.775
Let me just start and maybe I'll get some.

00:25:45.225 --> 00:25:48.135
I really think this is why it
happens and I, I can't prove

00:25:48.135 --> 00:25:49.185
it, but I can tell you this.

00:25:49.815 --> 00:25:54.045
We continually try to become a
church that allows there to be

00:25:54.045 --> 00:25:55.715
more conversations than just mine.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:00.300
So in churches that don't really
allow time to actually have genuine

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.550
conversations, there's no outlet.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.720
So if you guys are hearing me today
and you're saying, Hey, I have some

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:10.500
differences in what, what the, the word of
God's saying here, I have some questions

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.060
about what we're doing as a church.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.260
There's no outlet to discuss it.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.560
So when we don't give an outlet
to discuss it, what happens?

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.120
We make up the decisions on our own.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.430
We get in our own small little
groups to figure that out and.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:24.990
Things happen.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:30.120
So I want to continue to present as
a church for us that you see these

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.720
five minutes that we had before we
start, you know, uh, uh, preaching

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.310
and then after we tend to hang out.

00:26:35.315 --> 00:26:38.130
And then we have things called inspire
groups during the week to, to hang

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.180
out and get in the word of God.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.820
And my phone number's
always available to talk.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.550
Like it's those points where we want
to continue to provide access to

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.960
not lead these where if we do have
differences, let's talk about 'em.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.150
So that's one of Anybody else got
another idea why you think this?

00:26:53.745 --> 00:26:54.375
Pride.

00:26:55.395 --> 00:26:56.024
Absolutely.

00:26:56.655 --> 00:26:57.315
Absolutely.

00:26:59.805 --> 00:27:00.885
Making assumptions.

00:27:01.004 --> 00:27:03.165
Anybody, Nobody here
makes assumptions, right?

00:27:04.395 --> 00:27:05.595
I do it way too much.

00:27:05.835 --> 00:27:08.955
And then we don't ever go talk to
the person or talk to the, and then

00:27:09.465 --> 00:27:10.514
we believe the worst about 'em.

00:27:10.514 --> 00:27:12.735
And then when we finally
have the conversation, they

00:27:12.735 --> 00:27:13.544
never meant it that way.

00:27:15.195 --> 00:27:15.945
How do we handle that?

00:27:15.945 --> 00:27:16.995
We go talk to 'em quickly.

00:27:17.385 --> 00:27:17.925
It's a good one.

00:27:18.315 --> 00:27:19.395
Anybody else have something?

00:27:24.735 --> 00:27:27.315
Yes, that is their spiritual gift.

00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:29.925
They will even claim that my
spiritual gifts to come to the

00:27:29.925 --> 00:27:33.675
church and make sure there isn't
a 100% vote on anything guarantee.

00:27:33.765 --> 00:27:37.575
I'm telling you we've had 'em before,
not here at some of the church.

00:27:37.935 --> 00:27:40.755
So if that's you, praise God.

00:27:40.755 --> 00:27:41.505
I'm glad you're here.

00:27:41.535 --> 00:27:42.015
Keep coming.

00:27:42.525 --> 00:27:43.155
I love you.

00:27:44.565 --> 00:27:45.975
There's always gotta be one.

00:27:46.035 --> 00:27:47.655
So somebody's probably
gonna be that one, right?

00:27:47.655 --> 00:27:50.504
I, and ultimately, so I would
even say this, and this is,

00:27:50.504 --> 00:27:52.545
is it's church answer sin.

00:27:54.045 --> 00:28:00.254
Um, when my life's broken and I'm
dealing with sin, just being real

00:28:00.254 --> 00:28:03.285
with you guys, when my life's broken,
I'm dealing and wrestling with sin.

00:28:04.455 --> 00:28:05.445
I wanna stir the pot.

00:28:06.555 --> 00:28:07.875
I want somebody else to struggle with.

00:28:09.165 --> 00:28:11.535
So I'll start something
like I, I, I, Okay.

00:28:11.535 --> 00:28:15.135
So I just want, I'm, I'm glad I get to
be the example cause I'm the one saying

00:28:15.135 --> 00:28:18.945
up here when I'm frustrated, if I'm
having a bad day, you know what I do?

00:28:19.035 --> 00:28:20.325
I try to make Britney have a bad day.

00:28:21.255 --> 00:28:24.945
My wife, like, I'll say something just
to like, she needs to feel bad with me.

00:28:25.245 --> 00:28:26.655
I don't do that all the
time, but at times I do.

00:28:26.655 --> 00:28:28.815
And then of course I have to go
back and apologize cuz I'm a jerk.

00:28:29.955 --> 00:28:32.565
But sometimes we just come in
with so much sin in our life,

00:28:32.565 --> 00:28:33.555
so much brokenness in our.

00:28:34.274 --> 00:28:39.075
We create these things because if
we don't wanna be the only ones,

00:28:40.845 --> 00:28:42.195
and so that's the whole point.

00:28:42.345 --> 00:28:43.575
Church is messy.

00:28:43.725 --> 00:28:48.345
Paul knows this, but you know what
I love about church family, which

00:28:48.345 --> 00:28:51.975
means this, If you come in in a bad
mood like I have before and, and you

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.355
stir the pot, I must have love you.

00:28:53.595 --> 00:28:54.495
Hopefully we'll love each other.

00:28:54.675 --> 00:28:57.045
We're gonna obviously say, Hey, let's not
do, That's not valuable for the church.

00:28:57.045 --> 00:28:57.975
That's what we're doing today.

00:28:58.395 --> 00:29:01.845
But the goal is obviously Paul's
trying to help us know it will.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.680
It does happen and it will.

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.090
So when it does, don't be shocked.

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:06.900
But how do we handle it?

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.560
We avoid it.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:08.610
How do we handle?

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:09.390
We avoid it, right?

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.100
So how do we avoid it?

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.610
I believe God gives us places of
discussions without arguments and fighting

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.870
that we teach the truth like we're doing
today, like we do in our small groups.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:19.920
We teach the truth.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.940
We dive into God's word, and
we are unified in situations.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:24.990
I wanna be as clear as I can.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.340
I talk about this a lot in our church.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:28.650
Unity is not uniformity.

00:29:29.595 --> 00:29:33.254
You guys are not uniform in the way that
you dress or how, what your age is, right?

00:29:33.284 --> 00:29:36.225
But we're united and being
here in the same place, right?

00:29:36.225 --> 00:29:41.685
So an idea with this is that at times
we're gonna be united on the key facts

00:29:41.685 --> 00:29:46.095
of who Jesus is, why he came, how we give
our lives to him, what he's called us to

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.574
do, and then we can have some differences.

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:53.565
In a civil way that are not
outside of those things.

00:29:53.895 --> 00:29:57.105
But I think that this is so important,
just like what we're talking about here.

00:29:57.195 --> 00:30:00.825
We need to seek God and we need
to honor him at everything we do.

00:30:01.215 --> 00:30:05.415
So how we handle our disagreements are
so important in a civil and godly way.

00:30:06.255 --> 00:30:11.565
So we avoid ungodly discussions
by focusing on godly discussions

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:13.875
that build people up in their
faith rather than tear them down.

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:15.645
Don't be me whenever I'm mad.

00:30:16.065 --> 00:30:16.305
Okay.

00:30:16.695 --> 00:30:17.685
Basically, that's what I'm saying.

00:30:18.405 --> 00:30:25.260
So, If we remember to avoid disputing
over words and remember un um, avoiding

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:29.370
ungodly discussions, here's something
that we need to remember as well.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:33.000
The consequences of avoiding these
things, of not avoiding these things.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.490
The consequences of not
avoiding these things.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:40.900
We, we know as, as young kids, If you
have young kids, ever had young kids, at

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.590
some point they learn when things are hot.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:47.190
Now you hope that you're protecting them
by telling them, but at times they end up

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.690
putting their hand on there and they get.

00:30:50.325 --> 00:30:54.675
And they could have avoided it if they
just would've listened and remembered

00:30:54.825 --> 00:30:56.475
that mom and dad said, Don't touch this.

00:30:56.475 --> 00:30:57.015
This is hot.

00:30:57.525 --> 00:30:58.635
There's consequences.

00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:00.465
You know what Paul's trying to do?

00:31:01.035 --> 00:31:05.265
He's trying to help us avoid the
consequences of what it would mean

00:31:05.475 --> 00:31:09.405
to have un ungodly discussions
and the disputes over the words.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:09.615
Right?

00:31:10.185 --> 00:31:15.045
He says this in verse at the back end
of verse 17 and 18, that they run.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.760
Faith or they can be led as stray.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.419
So let's read this.

00:31:18.419 --> 00:31:22.530
He says, And their teaching will spread
like gang Green Haen and I don't know how

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:27.690
to say this name, Vi vis are among them,
they have departed from the truth saying

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:32.909
that the resurrection has already taken
place and are running the faith of some.

00:31:33.659 --> 00:31:36.870
The consequences of leaning into these
things is that we can run the faith

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:38.399
of, So I think that's a big deal.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:44.220
Y'all like when you know the consequences
of of our actions really matter that much.

00:31:44.915 --> 00:31:48.765
It challenges us to not touch the hot
thing because we don't wanna experience

00:31:48.765 --> 00:31:52.425
those things, to not touch these
things that are ungodly these things

00:31:52.425 --> 00:31:55.985
that are, are disputing, that are
causing people to run from their faith.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.950
So Paul mentions these two
men, and I always talk about

00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:59.850
this, this, it's kind of funny.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.310
You either wanna see your name
in the Bible or you don't.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:03.240
Sometimes you do.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:04.870
This is a great instance.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:08.790
You don't, and it makes me think for
me, like I wouldn't want my name to be

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.790
in the Bible if this is the reason why,
because I was disagreeing with Paul.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.290
But it happens, right?

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:16.830
So we see these two guys and they're
basically teaching this truth

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.420
about the spiritual resurrection.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.290
So they're teaching half.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.950
When we look at this, he says that
he, they mentioned that they do not

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.580
believe that the re, they believe the
resurrection has already taken place.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:30.060
So what they're saying is that
the resurrection spiritually has

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.970
already taken place, but there will
not be a physical resurrection.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.130
So if we think about this, we
wanna kind of be clear here.

00:32:35.135 --> 00:32:39.840
If you give your life to Christ,
there's a raising from death to life.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.500
Spiritually.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:42.360
You are no longer dead in your sins.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.430
You're raised with Christ and are alive.

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.570
They were actually teaching that
truth, which is very biblical that we.

00:32:49.379 --> 00:32:51.540
Obviously dead in our sins
and we are alive in Christ.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.500
And so that was there.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.010
But they were teaching that there
was no resurrection of our bodies.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:33:00.000
After Christ comes back, there was
no resurrection of our body, which

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.659
was contrary to the teaching of
what Paul and Jesus had taught.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.520
And so they were confusing people.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.560
So let's look at a couple
of scriptures here.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.669
If you wanna write these down.

00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:11.070
I don't have these up on the
screen, but here's what Jesus

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.939
talks about when he talks about the
resurrection in John 5 28 through 20.

00:33:15.719 --> 00:33:20.459
He says, Do not be amazed at this because
a time is coming when all who are in the

00:33:20.465 --> 00:33:23.159
graves will hear his voice and come out.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.159
And those who have done good
things to the resurrection of life.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:31.229
But um, yeah, but for those who have done
good things to the resurrection of life,

00:33:31.229 --> 00:33:34.439
but those who have done wicked things
to the resurrection of condemnation,

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.969
but then even Paul shares in First
Corinthians chapter 1512 through.

00:33:40.395 --> 00:33:43.695
Here's what he says, specifically
speaking to anybody who would talk

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.465
about there being no resurrection.

00:33:45.735 --> 00:33:50.085
Um, after Christ comes back, it says,
Now, if Christ is proclaimed as raised

00:33:50.085 --> 00:33:54.284
from the dead, how can some of you say
there is no resurrection of the dead?

00:33:54.705 --> 00:33:59.294
If there is no resurrection of the dead,
then not even Christ has been raised.

00:33:59.925 --> 00:34:03.765
If Christ has not been raised,
then our prop proclamation is

00:34:03.765 --> 00:34:05.865
in vain, and so is your faith.

00:34:06.165 --> 00:34:10.485
Moreover, if we are found to be false
witnesses about God, because we have

00:34:10.485 --> 00:34:16.034
testified wrongly about God that he raised
up Christ whom he did not raise up, in

00:34:16.034 --> 00:34:21.435
fact, the dead are not raised in Christ
for if the dead are not raised in Christ.

00:34:22.635 --> 00:34:24.195
Not even Christ has been raised.

00:34:24.255 --> 00:34:25.304
And so here's where it's kind of the.

00:34:26.025 --> 00:34:29.655
If Christ has not been raised,
then your faith is worthless

00:34:29.955 --> 00:34:31.275
and you're still in your sins.

00:34:31.965 --> 00:34:34.995
Those then who have fallen asleep
in Christ have also perished.

00:34:35.325 --> 00:34:39.045
So if we have put our hope in
Christ for this life only, then we

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:40.695
should be pitied more than others.

00:34:41.205 --> 00:34:42.345
There's a lot more to that text.

00:34:42.345 --> 00:34:45.135
If you want that verse, I can give
it to you after service, but it's

00:34:45.135 --> 00:34:48.225
really to this idea is if we do
not believe in the resurrection,

00:34:48.225 --> 00:34:50.505
then we are missing obviously.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:52.350
A lot to this.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:56.250
So these teachers were teaching
contrary to the word of God, to what

00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:00.000
Jesus had said, what Paul had said,
and they were leading people, ast.

00:35:01.755 --> 00:35:05.505
This was a great example of the ungodly
conversations that were happening.

00:35:05.895 --> 00:35:09.225
Something that was being spoke
contrary to the word of God.

00:35:09.375 --> 00:35:12.465
And that's the part where, again,
I think we can, should continue to

00:35:12.465 --> 00:35:17.325
have space to talk about what God's
word says, but ultimately we have to

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.305
protect what the word of God says.

00:35:19.305 --> 00:35:21.705
And so that's what I went back to
as soon as, as soon as I read this,

00:35:21.705 --> 00:35:23.745
just so you know, as a pastor,
as soon as I read this, I went.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.270
Well, where in the Bible doesn't talk
about the importance of the resurrection.

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.830
I didn't just take Paul's word for it.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.650
I actually went out and searched and
found, Hey, here's where it actually talks

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:34.950
about the importance of the resurrection
of our bodies and, and our life after

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:36.330
Christ and, and all these things.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.510
Okay, I can see where they missed the
mark and Paul had pointed this out,

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.840
and so even for me, I didn't just take
the word, I went and dove a little

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.120
deeper, and so we should all do that.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:49.440
But it's interesting when we look at
this, these guys taught half truths.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.960
They believed in one part of the
resurrection, but not the resurrection

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.770
of our lives after Christ.

00:35:53.775 --> 00:35:54.465
Half truths.

00:35:54.735 --> 00:35:57.945
Typically, the most dissension that
happens in the church is what they

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:02.115
say in sounds of what we're saying
sounds very similar to what somebody

00:36:02.115 --> 00:36:04.245
who's speaking incorrectly is saying.

00:36:04.635 --> 00:36:07.755
And so these people are being led
straight and run in their faith.

00:36:08.415 --> 00:36:11.895
So I know like you're sitting here
going, What's valuable for this?

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.005
We will need this.

00:36:13.125 --> 00:36:16.345
You may need this now, but we
will need this if we don't,

00:36:17.705 --> 00:36:19.515
um, pay attention and remember.

00:36:19.725 --> 00:36:21.585
And so I just wanna summarize this.

00:36:21.585 --> 00:36:22.215
We're gonna be.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:28.680
Is the word of God trains and equips us
to be able to fight the good fight and

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.510
to finish the race and to keep the faith.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:33.360
This is what we'll find in Second
Timothy chapter four, verse seven.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:40.350
Ultimately to avoid distractions, if
we will be people of the word workman

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.150
in the word to seek the word of God
will avoid some of these things.

00:36:46.214 --> 00:36:49.334
And so we need to remember these
things to, to keep with us.

00:36:49.334 --> 00:36:52.515
We need to be in the word of God
every day to keep with us, to help

00:36:52.515 --> 00:36:56.774
us avoid being distracted from what
God's called us to do and to be

00:36:57.185 --> 00:36:58.634
distracted from the truth of God's word.

00:36:59.415 --> 00:37:05.415
So how we conduct ourselves as follow over
Jesus and as a church is so, so important.

00:37:05.924 --> 00:37:09.015
Don't miss out that you were an
important body of Christ, of of

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.294
Christ, and an important part
of this church if you're here.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.180
And when we know those consequences,
that's the point, point guys.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:20.550
When we know the consequences and
how they are not valuable for us or

00:37:20.555 --> 00:37:24.840
valuable for other people, it will help
us to not lead, you know, ourselves

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.200
that way or to not be involved in
those, uh, godless discussions.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.930
Um, and so I just wanna
challenge you with this.

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.330
We, we have something, what we
call us in invitation every week.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:36.450
If you've been a part of a church, you've
heard it and you go, Oh, that's logical.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:37.170
It makes sense.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.780
An invitation is an
ability to just reflect.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:45.030
It's just to reflect and say,
Okay, Lord, I've heard the message.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.820
I've been just contemplating
it and processing.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.050
What does it mean?

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.140
What does it mean for me to
apply any of this to my life?

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.340
What do I need to do to, to
remember this in times of need?

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:58.710
And so maybe these are a couple
things that you might ask yourself.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:02.850
You might ask yourself this during, uh,
invitation and just seeking the Lord.

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:07.980
You might ask the Lord to help you to not
be a part of, uh, disputing over words

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.720
and getting into ungodly conversations.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:16.020
Where you'll prioritize truth, um, over
those false things that he has said.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:16.410
Right?

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:17.880
Not getting distracted from the mission.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.730
Maybe that's one thing that you would
pray for, just to prepare yourself

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.200
for the coming of something like that.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:27.390
You might ask God to help you deal
with the differences, um, that

00:38:27.395 --> 00:38:31.290
you're having or the differences
in, um, honoring God and the church.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.830
What I would say here is, is
that maybe you have been a

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:35.940
part of something like this.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.110
Maybe you have caught yourself
having fruitless discussions.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:43.500
Maybe this is just a good time to go
before the Lord and say, You know what,

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.030
Lord, I've been a part of that before.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.010
Uh, uh, I've had that heart before.

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:48.000
Forgive me.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.530
Help me not do that again.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:52.200
And, and this is a great time
to, to think through that.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.770
Um, here's another one, and I, this is
probably the last one I wanna mention.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:39:00.870
You may have been a part of a church and
the reason why you left it is because

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:03.390
you experienced these fruitless discuss.

00:39:04.515 --> 00:39:07.785
I'm telling you that it's happened
more times than not, where I talk

00:39:07.785 --> 00:39:11.505
to people and they say, We don't
wanna go to church because of all

00:39:11.505 --> 00:39:15.135
the infighting in the church, all the
fruitless discussions, all the things

00:39:15.135 --> 00:39:16.845
that were contrary to the word of God.

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:18.135
We don't wanna be a part of that.

00:39:18.765 --> 00:39:20.685
If that was you here,
here's my encouragement.

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:24.915
Number one, I, I pray that you seek the
Lord today and ask the Lord to give you

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:29.115
peace, to forgive those who maybe you had
a bad experience with the last church.

00:39:29.655 --> 00:39:31.275
Cuz don't bring that baggage with.

00:39:32.295 --> 00:39:34.185
You should be able to move on from it.

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:36.165
So learn to forgive the people
that did that to you, the

00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:37.245
church that did that to you.

00:39:37.695 --> 00:39:42.915
But my encouragement as well is, is
that you strive to not be that church

00:39:42.915 --> 00:39:46.605
here, not to be that person here that
would lead someone astray or for a

00:39:46.605 --> 00:39:48.045
new person to come into the church.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:51.225
And the first thing they see is
people arguing about worthless things.

00:39:51.765 --> 00:39:54.165
So there's multiple things you can
pray and seek the Lord about today,

00:39:54.165 --> 00:39:55.755
but my challenge is to, to take this.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:00.629
And to remember to seek the Lord about
how you apply to your lives now and

00:40:00.629 --> 00:40:03.810
how it prepares you for the future
and for our church in the future.

00:40:04.379 --> 00:40:07.859
But also, I don't ever wanna
hesitate and miss this opportunity

00:40:07.859 --> 00:40:10.049
if you've never given your life to
Jesus, if you don't even know what

00:40:10.049 --> 00:40:11.580
it means of relationship to Jesus.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.740
And you're sitting here hearing all these
things about, man, I don't know if I

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:17.250
wanna be a part of, uh, uh, the Christian
Church because it sounds a little messy.

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:20.400
I'll just tell you this, it's messy in
the world and it's messy in the church,

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.730
but the good part in the church, we
have Jesus who's forgiven us, who guides

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:29.340
us, directs us with this word, and
he gives us love and grace and mercy.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:34.440
So I'm gonna pray for us and uh,
we'll have some time invitation and,

00:40:34.445 --> 00:40:35.550
uh, towards the end of invitation.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:36.510
This is something I wanna mention.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:37.650
Lauren, I didn't tell he
was gonna mention this.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.200
What you'll hear a lot of times
with invitation, we're gonna,

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.470
they're gonna sing, gets you an
opportunity to just, uh, reflect.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.500
But when you're done reflecting my
encouragements to go ahead and stand and.

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:51.360
And worship the Lord on the way
out, um, in our time of invitation.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.270
Cause I think it's a God honoring
way to do that for us as a church.

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:59.790
So, Lord Jesus, we thank you again
for your word and Lord, today.

00:41:00.029 --> 00:41:05.850
Um, I hope that we understand how,
um, our words matter and Lord, how we

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:08.700
handle differences in the church matter.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:11.820
Lord, I, I pray that you
protect our church Lord, as,

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:14.370
um, we saw here some ungod.

00:41:15.195 --> 00:41:18.435
Discussions that were happening in
Timothy's church, uh, Lord, that was

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.965
causing people to run from their faith.

00:41:19.965 --> 00:41:23.325
Lord, I pray that we as a
church avoid these things.

00:41:24.225 --> 00:41:30.225
Lord, I pray that we seek your word, uh,
as individuals, as a church, um, and we

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:34.965
seek to know it well so that we can honor
you in anything that we say and we do.

00:41:35.205 --> 00:41:39.045
And, um, Lord, we know that
you are a God that forgives.

00:41:39.885 --> 00:41:42.435
So, Lord, if we've ever in the
past been a part of something

00:41:42.435 --> 00:41:43.455
like this, Lord forgive us.

00:41:43.455 --> 00:41:47.055
If, if we've ever maybe experienced a bad
church experience where this happened,

00:41:47.055 --> 00:41:51.735
Lord, I pray that we are able to forgive
them and move on, but God is a church.

00:41:51.735 --> 00:41:56.655
I just pray as well that we
every day, Lord, um, seek you.

00:41:57.345 --> 00:42:01.995
That's my hope and, and, and passion
and, um, prayer every day for each

00:42:01.995 --> 00:42:04.215
person in this room, Lord, that
they know you deeper and deeper.

00:42:04.215 --> 00:42:08.715
And if they do these things, Lord, in
which we could be, uh, distracted by.

00:42:09.615 --> 00:42:12.885
Uh, will, will not distract us
because Lord, we know the truth.

00:42:14.115 --> 00:42:17.955
So, Lord, we just, um, pray that you
meet us today and, and help us know,

00:42:17.955 --> 00:42:22.425
Lord, what we should pray and seek
the Lord, uh, for, um, in this time.

00:42:22.575 --> 00:42:24.495
And may we leave out here
change because of it.

00:42:24.735 --> 00:42:26.205
And so, Lord, we just pray
this in your heavenly name.

00:42:26.775 --> 00:42:27.045
Amen.
