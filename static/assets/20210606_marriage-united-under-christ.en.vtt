00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.320
two we have a bible for you on your way out if&nbsp;
you don't have a bible um also i love using the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.680
bible speaking of a life church pastor that's here&nbsp;
today the holy bible is one of my favorite apps to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.920
use um just be able to study god's word to be&nbsp;
able to go through devotionals it's a really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.400
really good way to keep god's word with you if&nbsp;
you don't want to carry around your heavy book&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.280
which i love reading when i'm at home but when&nbsp;
i'm out i love the app so you need to read it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.960
on the bible app and grab a bible on your way&nbsp;
out or today you can kind of see it here to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.560
text behind me today but we're going to be&nbsp;
in ephesians chapter 5. i started in verse 21&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.560
and i'm gonna talk a little bit about verse 21. i&nbsp;
really was playing a cover a little bit last week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.520
but we've been walking through this book&nbsp;
and so here's the reason why i was actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.360
talking to elise and doug over here just a&nbsp;
minute ago the reason why we value walking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.080
through books of the bible is there's a whole&nbsp;
picture there's a whole story to the letter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.720
of why like this this writer paul wrote the letter&nbsp;
and so being able to see it all come together is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.560
huge for us as believers because it really applies&nbsp;
to all areas not just one area so today we're just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.440
so happy to be on this topic of what does marriage&nbsp;
look like within a gardening appearance right so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.240
we're gonna talk about submission and it's gonna&nbsp;
be interesting because a lot of times if you guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.320
know where i'm going with this a lot of times you&nbsp;
hear this statement why send it to your husbands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.760
and that's usually all you hear about in this text&nbsp;
the more i spent time in it men if you're in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.680
room this is really going to be a text that's&nbsp;
going to challenge you more than it is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.440
challenge your wives um and so it's really cool&nbsp;
as we get to jump into this today um what this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.920
text teaches us about relationships with other&nbsp;
people and so over the next couple of weeks we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.520
going to be dealing with relationships within&nbsp;
the marriage relationships with your children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.640
relationships within your work um and how that&nbsp;
applies to our life um uh in our day-to-day life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.400
so i want to kind of share this scenario with&nbsp;
you anybody ever had an argument with a spouse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.720
and if you don't have a spouse maybe another&nbsp;
person where you know you were right anybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.400
i mean you know you were right and you're gonna&nbsp;
make sure they know you're right um that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.720
problem is that sometimes it's me every day right&nbsp;
because i'm kind of prideful and like being right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.080
um but so so in that instance let's think within&nbsp;
the context of a marriage we want to be right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.560
we know we're right and we're going to make&nbsp;
sure they know their life but in the end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.080
even if they realize that they're wrong&nbsp;
the question is were you really right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.760
we're gonna find today that answer is no i'm just&nbsp;
gonna read one of the verses that we'll highlight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.200
even more later but in verse 31 it says this in&nbsp;
the context of marriage it says for this reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.240
a man will leave his father and mother and&nbsp;
be joined to his wife and two will become one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.720
flesh so this idea behind winning arguments and&nbsp;
knowing your rights within the context of marriage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.240
honestly when you're right and you're&nbsp;
winning the argument you're actually losing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.200
um and it's hard to think that way really whenever&nbsp;
you were completely one right so when you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.640
battling each other and you're fighting against&nbsp;
each other you're really fighting against yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.960
we're gonna kind of build on that today but this&nbsp;
kind of catch you up on where we've been we've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.400
been again in the book of ephesians we've really&nbsp;
been talking about the first three chapters of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.560
ephesians talks about all that god has done for&nbsp;
us and the last couple of chapters we've really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.240
been dealing with this idea now that we know&nbsp;
all that god's done for us how do we walk as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.080
basically a christ follower in that um and again&nbsp;
so we've been dealing with a lot of individual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.880
things is how we are to live in purity and&nbsp;
we are to walk into thin light and we are to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.680
live our lives on purpose because we have only&nbsp;
a limited amount of time so we've talked about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.040
these things as individuals but it's getting ready&nbsp;
to translate now into relationships relationships&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.120
and the reason why i say that is if you are&nbsp;
going to follow jesus the only way in which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.440
you really begin to show how you follow jesus&nbsp;
is in the process of the life of relationships&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.720
and so all of us here i'm just guessing you&nbsp;
guys have relationships either in the home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.200
in your workplace maybe it's just in the community&nbsp;
but those relationships are ways for us to display&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.160
christ's love to the world and so i'm hoping&nbsp;
today that you'll get to kind of see a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.600
bit more of that but lastly i want to kind of&nbsp;
catch you up here last week we talked about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.440
this in the texas is be filled with the spirit&nbsp;
what does it mean to be filled with the spirit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.040
of means to be joyful we're doing this in verse&nbsp;
19 this is to be thankful we learned this in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.200
verse 20. and the last one that we didn't talk&nbsp;
about that we're going to talk about more today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.000
is submission and so if you're wanting to know&nbsp;
if you were spirit-filled it's these these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.040
that which you would show in your life to be&nbsp;
joyful and to be thankful and to be submissive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.480
and it's interesting i'm going to read this&nbsp;
verse 21 it's a submitting to one another in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.800
the fear of christ so submission is going to be&nbsp;
an interesting conversation we'll have with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.800
but its mission to one another is a way that we&nbsp;
display when you're filled with the spirit of god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.880
and so there's more to that but i want to to&nbsp;
just even talk a bit more with this before we get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.840
started is that our focus today is on marriage&nbsp;
but you're going to see this that it really is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.120
on relationships and the number one most important&nbsp;
relationship that you have is your relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.240
with jesus that dictates relationships so let's&nbsp;
read the full text and kind of teach them with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.720
couple of different verses here but in ephesians&nbsp;
chapter 5 verses starting in verse i'll start in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.120
verse 22 since the country referenced from one&nbsp;
it says it says wives submit to your husbands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.360
as to because the husband is the head of the&nbsp;
wife as christ is the head of the church he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.480
the savior of the body now as the church submits&nbsp;
to christ so also wives are supposed to submit to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.000
their husbands in everything husbands love your&nbsp;
wives just as christ loved the church and gave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.160
himself for her to make her holy cleansing and her&nbsp;
uh cleansing her with the washing of the water by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.760
the wood and he did this to present the church&nbsp;
to himself in splendor without spot or wrinkle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.680
or anything like that but holy and blameless in&nbsp;
the same way husbands are to love their wives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.920
as their own bodies he who loves his wife loves&nbsp;
himself for no one ever hates his own flesh but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.360
provides and cares for him just as christ does&nbsp;
for the church since we are members of his body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.240
for this reason a man will leave his father and&nbsp;
mother and be joined to his wife and two will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.960
become one flesh and this mystery is profound but&nbsp;
i am talking about christ in the church to sum up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.680
each one of them is to love his wife as himself&nbsp;
and his wife respect her husband so let's pray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.000
and invite god in to open our hearts to what&nbsp;
he's saying so lord jesus we thank you again for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.040
this time uh to open up your word to um really&nbsp;
important to be able to come open minded lord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.880
with our hearts as well to see what you have&nbsp;
to say to us where we know your work is truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.240
and then we can gain so much wisdom from us or to&nbsp;
apply to our lives to live a life that honors you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:02.080
but also is beneficial for us as we are still&nbsp;
here walking this earth and so we just pray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:09.840
amen so if you're anything like me you read a text&nbsp;
like that and you go there's a lot going wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.960
and i would agree with you it's a it's a lot&nbsp;
going on and so let me just share this with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:22.240
me i try to be as honest as i possibly can&nbsp;
in studying god's word um i still struggle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.200
getting into his word and totally understanding&nbsp;
everything so i had to break it down i don't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.920
you guys if you if you struggle reading does&nbsp;
work i don't know if you're with me i do okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.920
so what do i have to do i have to go in and&nbsp;
i have to kind of break this down and that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.560
what we're going to do here we're going to take&nbsp;
time to kind of break this down and look at it in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.880
pieces because it's going to make sense as we do&nbsp;
that whenever i looked at this whole moment okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.360
this is a little bit complicated but let's let's&nbsp;
look at this together so we'll walk by verse by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.920
person and just so you know i love including&nbsp;
you guys so i'm gonna ask a few questions i'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.200
love for some feedback and some answers as we walk&nbsp;
through this together and so the first thing here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.480
it says is why submit to your husband's ass to the&nbsp;
lord right so what is submission when you look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:10.400
submission it's voluntary right it's a voluntary&nbsp;
attitude of giving in or cooperating it's a choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:18.560
it's not a force of submission it's a choice&nbsp;
what we see here it says to submit to husbands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:24.480
as to the lord well if we want to know how a life&nbsp;
is to submit to a husband we first have to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.240
how she's supposed to submit to the lord right&nbsp;
we have to start there we don't start with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.400
husband when we start with how she's supposed to&nbsp;
submit to christ because that's the example so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.360
that's what i started was how do we walk through&nbsp;
this so why submission to christ what does that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.400
look like and so um let's start with this before&nbsp;
we kind of dive in and i kind of give you some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:53.840
examples what do you believe it looks like for a&nbsp;
while to submit to christ what do you guys think

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.840
good what else

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.400
nope we're not there yet

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:33.920
so let's start with this why would a wife&nbsp;
want to submit herself to the lord let me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.320
answer that question why would a wife&nbsp;
want to submit herself so let's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:44.320
look at this individually why would a woman&nbsp;
want to submit herself to work voluntarily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.040
let's go back to that voluntarily giving&nbsp;
and cooperating right to be a part of

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.760
so it's kind of that idea so let's let's go back&nbsp;
to what i said earlier if the first three chapters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.480
in ephesians said this is all that god's done for&nbsp;
us based upon what god's done for us so what has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:14.480
god done for a wife uh again when we're talking&nbsp;
about this relationship with a wife and god or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.600
christ yes he's given her grace and mercy and&nbsp;
forgiveness when i started thinking about this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:26.000
god has shown her that he can care for her and god&nbsp;
has shown her that he loves her despite her flaws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.320
that he can provide for her that he can empower&nbsp;
her this is this is important that he can empower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:36.160
what does that mean that god can use that wife&nbsp;
to do amazing things right we talk about what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.360
god's purpose for your life everyone has a purpose&nbsp;
so that why as she submits herself to christ knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:48.160
that god's got to plan for her so that's a reason&nbsp;
why because of all that god's done for her she can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.640
submit herself to christ because she knows that&nbsp;
christ will take care of her i don't know about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.040
you guys but whenever somebody takes care of&nbsp;
me i think about it this way so maybe it works&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.880
more for me when i'm a part of an employed&nbsp;
employer that takes care of their employees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:10.960
i'm confident i can trust them i can submit to&nbsp;
their leadership because i know they care for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.280
me because i know they love them so think about&nbsp;
this as god the creator of the world the one who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.920
created you loves you so much he cares for you he&nbsp;
desires a relationship with you right and so these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.040
things are are the reason why when we think about&nbsp;
as a wife submits ourselves to the christ it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.800
and so we it's easy when we think about&nbsp;
this but when we look at this submission um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.000
let me let me just read this you know this&nbsp;
morning start thinking so the why submits to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.520
god because he has done so much for her and&nbsp;
she knows he has her best interests in mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.360
and so when we think about submitting to&nbsp;
christ let's think about what christ says about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:57.520
marriage right one he blesses marriage he believes&nbsp;
in marriage two it says that in verse 23 that he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.080
given the man to be the head of the marriage&nbsp;
and we'll get more to that so don't jump ahead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:09.840
he knows what's best for her so when submitting&nbsp;
to the husband she's really submitted to christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.640
and submitting to the husband i mean&nbsp;
she's truly submitting herself to christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.320
not really to the husband and so let me&nbsp;
kind of take a step back surprisingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:25.360
paul the writer of this letter is writing to&nbsp;
believers this is in the context of a marriage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.640
that is believers on both sides right and so the&nbsp;
question is what do we do if we are in a marriage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.640
where we have one person that knows christ&nbsp;
involves christ the one that doesn't there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.480
still a submission on one of them there's still&nbsp;
a role to follow the husband again not to sin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.840
but in respect and we're going to get more into&nbsp;
that and that that's that's one of the ways we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:51.040
kind of jump more into this but when we look at&nbsp;
really what the definition of biblical submission&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:57.680
to marriage is it's a wife making a choice not&nbsp;
to overtly resist her husband's will this is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:02.880
to say she can't disagree with him that she&nbsp;
can't express her opinion really a wife this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.560
is in submission to her husband's authority or&nbsp;
over her it's really strength it's not weakness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.240
and here's the greatest example of that think&nbsp;
about christ and so if you don't know the story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.480
i'm going to kind of catch up a little bit so&nbsp;
before jesus went to the cross was arrested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.280
he went to the garden of distance and if&nbsp;
we we actually talked about this recently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.880
before he was taken into into basically the&nbsp;
prison he was asking the lord to change his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.520
circumstance if you can take this cut from me&nbsp;
if you can change this circumstance do it but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.480
not my little journal see if you know enough&nbsp;
about the bible if you don't it's okay but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:47.840
bible says that jesus is equal to god he is god&nbsp;
but yet he submitted to his father in submission&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:55.440
why because god knew it was best god had not only&nbsp;
jesus best interests in mind but our best interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:02.880
see it was easy for jesus to submit even though&nbsp;
and when i say easy it was it was sure let's have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.000
a disease to submit even in an instance where&nbsp;
it was a struggle that makes sense so so jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.720
is our greatest example of submission to god so&nbsp;
we can submit to christ we can learn as wives to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.600
submit to her husband so this is the part where i&nbsp;
would say okay you know let's just stop here right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.320
live submit to the husband so let's just let's&nbsp;
just move on right and but here's where it gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.680
tough guys and this is where i want you guys to&nbsp;
listen up i'm kind of trying to look all yellow on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:36.320
the eyes i spent this week reminding myself that&nbsp;
the next rest of the text is so important because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:43.520
god's really placed us in a world in which we&nbsp;
reflect who christ is to our lives so let's look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.320
at it so it says here in verse 20 well so a lot of&nbsp;
people jump down to first 23 we're going to do one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:54.080
from there but verse 23 says again he is the head&nbsp;
of the wife as christ is head of the church and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.840
just kind of affirming some of the things we&nbsp;
talked about is if husbands are the head of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.480
the wife just like christ's head of the&nbsp;
church how is christ head of the church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:09.280
first of all christ set the example right he set&nbsp;
the example he said the example on how to follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:16.080
god he said the example on how to sacrifice he&nbsp;
said the example how to love so if men are placed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:24.320
in this position of headship the head of that&nbsp;
family then he is really setting an example of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:31.680
what it means to fall across what it means to care&nbsp;
for her and love for her and to despite her flaws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:38.000
still love her provide for her empower her to live&nbsp;
before god and a reminder this first corinthians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.600
13 4 says this love is patient love is kind love&nbsp;
is not in you it's not boastful it's not arrogant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:50.160
see men we're supposed to believe in those things&nbsp;
now it is both sides why is it supposed to be love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.960
is patient love is kind husbands are supposed to&nbsp;
understand that as well husbands leave the charge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.360
that's why they're put in that position so men if&nbsp;
you want to know do you have a cop out to say hey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.200
the answer is no you're leaving the&nbsp;
example just be honest of what submission&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.960
leaving an example of is is to christ&nbsp;
and that should be a wake up for us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.920
of our role in the home right so you understand&nbsp;
this this is not for you to feel bad about what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.800
you've done in the past this is for you to know&nbsp;
hey i can get it right today i can get it right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:29.440
today and i can begin to move forward and work&nbsp;
and walk in that so verse 24 says this this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:37.680
to make her holy and cleansing with the washing of&nbsp;
the water of the word so how um and so it really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:43.600
talks about here and so i'm gonna jump back here&nbsp;
um he's talking about christ in the body and how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.680
the church which is the body of christ submits&nbsp;
to christ why she'll submit to their husbands in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.880
everything so what's the translation with this&nbsp;
verse as you individually submit to christ as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.440
child of god you shall submit to your husbands&nbsp;
in everything who himself submits to christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.680
and so when it comes to most marital struggles&nbsp;
within the context of a christian relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:12.640
do you know that the number one issue is&nbsp;
selfishness selfishness and this is the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:20.960
most difficult i think part of the world that we&nbsp;
live in is we are driven by selfishness meaning we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.440
want to succeed we want to do what we want we want&nbsp;
to do what we think we want to do what pleases us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:33.120
and so in the conflict of marriage it usually ends&nbsp;
up being a result of selfishness but this is where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:39.360
the relationship of jesus matters so how do we&nbsp;
overcome it it comes where we have a relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:45.360
with jesus together and we encourage each other to&nbsp;
follow jesus together and so if you're struggling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.720
in your marriage today maybe you've struggled&nbsp;
in past marriages i don't know what it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.040
here's my encouragement for you it starts with&nbsp;
following jesus if you want to know where to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:59.840
it starts with following jesus so let's let's&nbsp;
really jump into the husbands in verse 25&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.400
um because this is where it's going to be a little&nbsp;
bit of sticky as we're going to walk through this

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:13.680
it says here in verse 25 it says husbands&nbsp;
love your wives just as christ loved the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.840
church i also want to stop right&nbsp;
there okay now we gotta figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.520
not hey husbands don't love your wives that's&nbsp;
it but as christ loved the church now we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.440
to figure out how to christ love the church&nbsp;
so let me ask this question how do you when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.880
you think about christ love the churches do&nbsp;
you understand who the church is it's anybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:41.840
who would call themselves the following jesus how&nbsp;
did christ love the church give me some examples

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.340
it's good

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.840
anything else

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.200
so let's start with just sacrifice right so&nbsp;
husbands are supposed to love like christ christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:16.800
set the example the first the example he said was&nbsp;
how he was requested right so that's in verse 25&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.960
it says that we can't finish that before he says&nbsp;
he loves to watch just as christ loved the church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:27.120
and gave himself for her and so when we think&nbsp;
about this true christian love is not self-seeking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:33.600
it's really willing to sacrifice um for the&nbsp;
benefit of others and so i just think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:39.680
this then what are we not willing to sacrifice&nbsp;
for our lives because i mean we all are saying hey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.560
guys if you're anything like me we have&nbsp;
this list probably in the back of our minds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.080
that when our wife asks us to do something we&nbsp;
probably pull it out and say but i did this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:55.920
but i did this i did this and the question is is&nbsp;
what are you not willing to sacrifice what is too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:03.040
much what is too much well christ says that his&nbsp;
life wasn't too much and maybe if i pulled you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.720
guys in this room if i said if you had to take a&nbsp;
bullet for your wife would you do it you probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.760
would say yes so it's not i'm not really lacking&nbsp;
that but sometimes it's in simple things right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.680
so what if the dishes need to be done for husbands&nbsp;
should we serve in such a way do the dishes or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:27.440
should we tell it until what about this men like&nbsp;
my wife's a stay-at-home mom when i get home what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.920
if i told her hey i'm just going to take a break&nbsp;
you go to the kids all day go get your nails done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.920
right or is it because i'm too tired and i'm&nbsp;
too selfish because i want to go sit down and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:42.560
watch tv and i really want a dinner cook too do i&nbsp;
know so let's let's keep on going with that what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:49.040
about this what if your wife wants to stay home&nbsp;
so what if your wife wants to stay home with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.720
kids and she wants to quit her job what do you&nbsp;
do man what do you do i don't know what you do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:01.200
we chose to let them quit our job and stay&nbsp;
home and take care of the kids and change our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:06.720
whole trajectory of finances and what life looked&nbsp;
like but here's what it was i was loving my life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.520
like christ loved the church sacrificially so&nbsp;
let me tell you when she made that decision&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:18.000
i was a believer but not long before that&nbsp;
i wasn't a believer so just to kind of step&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.440
out there with you me and my wife were&nbsp;
actually unequally guilty as what they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.000
call right somebody who was an unbeliever&nbsp;
and i believe that that was made together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.640
and uh i would say this and i learned this&nbsp;
the moment that i give my life to christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.560
is the first day i've been&nbsp;
to love my wife like christ

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.920
and and that may sound crazy well didn't&nbsp;
you stand to alter and tell her you love her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.680
give her a ring and didn't you provide for&nbsp;
absolutely i did but it was not the way that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:50.080
christ loved her and set the example for&nbsp;
him and so there's there's things guys men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:58.160
that that we need to be willing to sacrifice&nbsp;
jesus as the example to serve our wives so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:04.560
let's keep going on so how else did christ&nbsp;
love the church well from a sanctifying love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.320
and it says this in verse 26 and that's kind of&nbsp;
a big word we'll kind of talk about that this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:12.720
to make her wholly cleansing her with the washing&nbsp;
of the water by the ward that sounds a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.680
christianised and it a little bit is and i&nbsp;
get it i'm the same thing here's what it means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.840
is when you are loving your wife in such&nbsp;
a way that sets her apart from the lord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.840
sets her apart from both which means&nbsp;
you're setting her up for success&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:35.040
to love the lord and to to spend time with the&nbsp;
lord and to grow in her faith and you're you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:41.040
making her holy by pleasing her with anything like&nbsp;
the word of god right so you're giving her time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.400
love god and have a relationship with god you're&nbsp;
not just saying hey i'll do that and you just do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:53.840
whatever else you know it's giving her space and&nbsp;
empowering her to have a relationship with god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:02.000
when you look at it here is um it's a satisfying&nbsp;
one so verses 20 through 32 it says this in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.440
same way husbands are love their wives as their&nbsp;
own bodies he who loves his wife loves himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:14.000
and i think this is a great way why did paul use&nbsp;
this example um men we probably said the greatest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.520
example of we really do love ourselves like we&nbsp;
i'm self okay so all this stuff frozen i'm pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.440
suckers like i want what i want i want everything&nbsp;
to work around my schedule when i went in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.240
and that's just the self-excitement so paul's&nbsp;
speaking to the heart of men who typically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.040
want to say do everything that i want to do&nbsp;
and so you know husbands i'm just it sounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.560
like i'm kind of rolling on him you may be an&nbsp;
amazing husband and you're just affirming on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:41.120
these things in life i hope that you affirm the&nbsp;
positives that your your husband's in your life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:46.880
this is this is just a practical example for us as&nbsp;
we live our lifestyle from jesus how we apply it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:52.320
in our lives and maybe some areas that we need to&nbsp;
work on to be better men and women and so we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:58.640
going to kind of see how this works together so&nbsp;
when we look at this therefore this is whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.120
each does to each other he himself does to himself&nbsp;
so disagreements we'll talk about this opinion so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.240
if you disagree and you're fighting you're really&nbsp;
fighting against yourself and and i know this i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.840
don't like five minutes myself that's pretty much&nbsp;
a losing battle so the man who loves his wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:19.680
actually and loves his self so as your wife's&nbsp;
physical emotional and spiritual needs are met&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:26.640
then you're actually loving yourself man i don't&nbsp;
know if you can get enjoyment out of you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:32.800
your wife's one of our spiritual gifts it's like&nbsp;
my wife loves hitting flowers a waste of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:39.440
she's not in the room she does she knows this&nbsp;
but you know i buy flowers for her because it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:48.800
it's one sunscreen i'm sorry i use the wrong&nbsp;
turn it's a rough lunch flowers i can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.440
rude and just never buy our flowers because&nbsp;
you know what it's expensive it's wasted

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.760
but then on the other side this&nbsp;
is the part where i love is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:06.800
this is not a one-way street right we're&nbsp;
sacrificing ourselves we're being sacrificial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.960
in our relationship and we're being we're&nbsp;
being sanctified we're being satisfied in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.520
relation but it is a two-way street watch you can&nbsp;
do the same thing when we talk about submitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:24.160
to his leadership he says the example was what&nbsp;
should you do follow his example see this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.840
where this picture is see why you thought you&nbsp;
started you're getting out of this hey ray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.920
i'm submitting to him as he submits to christ&nbsp;
and he's got all these things he's got to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.840
but the answer to that is he's&nbsp;
sending the example for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.840
so let me ask this question is is&nbsp;
marriage and victory relationship

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.400
because it's not a competition we are one&nbsp;
we are one we get one of them together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:07.200
when you separate and say it's 50 50 you've&nbsp;
separated yourself 100 means you're together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.360
and there's days i'm just going to let&nbsp;
you know there's days where my wife gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.640
over a hundred and i give nothing i don't know why&nbsp;
because there's just days i'm having a lot of day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.200
but there's days where i hit 100 and she's&nbsp;
giving lessons once that means means we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:28.080
working together to fill each other's gaps and&nbsp;
to empower each other and to really point each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.720
other to christ to point each other to christ to&nbsp;
have that relationship and be from one another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.480
that's the type of relationship that god&nbsp;
desires for us to have in our marriages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:43.440
but sometimes we really wrestle with this&nbsp;
idea of we're on opposite sides and we're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:50.160
we're not we are togetherness and that's what i'm&nbsp;
reminded of every time is my wife is my biggest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.960
cheerleader my biggest cheerleader i wouldn't&nbsp;
be ran today if she did not encourage me in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:00.400
moments in which i felt and i would say she's not&nbsp;
in the room but obviously the same thing for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.960
because there's days where she's struggling&nbsp;
to be a homeschool mom she's working in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.720
mornings she's trying to do other things she's&nbsp;
trying to help with the ministry and she's like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.400
i feel like i have to go and you know what i need&nbsp;
to do i need to live here in the united states&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.320
you are succeeding and here's why i don't list&nbsp;
out every reason why she's like i don't see him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.960
but thank you right so i am her biggest&nbsp;
cheerleader she's my biggest cheerleader&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.720
that's how god has designed this to&nbsp;
be that's how god's designed to be

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:34.160
let me just challenge you with this we're almost&nbsp;
ending i know i've seen a little longer but when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:39.520
it comes to this idea of what does it look like&nbsp;
men to love your wives as christ-loving church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.760
and we talk about meeting each&nbsp;
other's needs emotional physical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:49.360
you name it right we need to learn this&nbsp;
in our relationships even in our friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.120
relationships let's just talk about this even&nbsp;
in our firm relations to be honest with each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:59.280
other about what the other one does why your&nbsp;
husband doesn't know how to read your mind

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:07.680
husbands you should pay attention more okay&nbsp;
those are just two sides in the same place my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.800
idea behind this is be honest with each other&nbsp;
i mean if we're for each other we want this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.520
marriage to work out we want to be a godly&nbsp;
marriage we want to be for each other be honest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.520
there's some days that say hey honey you're just&nbsp;
not paying attention to me you know how i say it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.400
and i love you not an angry way like you don't&nbsp;
care about that right hey i know you've been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.120
really busy i'd love to spend 15 minutes really&nbsp;
here you know that means a lot to her because i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:36.000
told her what i needed and then there's sometimes&nbsp;
where she says honey you need to stop working you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.280
need to stop thinking about ministry you need to&nbsp;
be present with the kids and it's hard to hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.440
though sometimes but then i stopped working and&nbsp;
i get on the ground and start thinking of kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.720
because she knows what i need i know what she&nbsp;
needs for each other so do not hold it in and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:59.200
expect them to figure it out tell each other&nbsp;
because it's so much i'm telling you it's so much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:04.640
better than marriage when you tell each other&nbsp;
so we look here in verse 32 and it says this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.480
um it says this mystery is profound but&nbsp;
i'm talking about christ and the church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.520
and so what he's saying is this whole example of&nbsp;
marriage has always been this example so he's kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.960
of saying hey the marriage looks like christ and&nbsp;
the church the church is those who follow jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:26.720
their relationship so if we want to know how&nbsp;
to have a great relationship with marriage it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:33.200
starts with having a relationship with jesus&nbsp;
that's really the picture we need have a wish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.320
jesus and how is that relationship how's&nbsp;
that relationship is the question that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.840
should ask yourself maybe rather than trying&nbsp;
to fix your spouse fix your relationship with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.960
jesus and as you do allow that to help fix maybe&nbsp;
the issues that you're having in your marriage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:54.400
i i heard this statement and it really challenged&nbsp;
me what if god's purpose in marriage is to not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:54.400 --> 00:30:02.160
make you happy by having the perfect spouse but&nbsp;
to teach you to look like jesus by giving you a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:11.040
perfected spouse that you can show grace mercy&nbsp;
love and forgiveness you know i'm telling you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.400
i was there i think me and we didn't fight for&nbsp;
our first year we didn't once because that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.520
what i thought the picture of a relationship was&nbsp;
until you're too heavy and realizing this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:28.080
battle right it's one that we are two people that&nbsp;
are different we work together and so as i came&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:34.480
to the family of jesus i realized that it is a&nbsp;
relationship that we get to show to the world

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.480
and so we are a picture to the world of what&nbsp;
a relationship with jesus looks like through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:48.720
our marriage that may sound crazy but have&nbsp;
you ever had somebody say you know you and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.200
your husband just really get along well&nbsp;
and you guys really work things out from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.440
you take care of the kids and you kind of share&nbsp;
responsibilities whenever you're out in public&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.840
how do you do that and you know what we do because&nbsp;
it's not perfect everything i'm saying when they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:07.120
do ask that question it's because of christ&nbsp;
because i care so much about her that i'm not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.280
selfishly getting into my own conversations that&nbsp;
i'm actually caring about my kids in the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:16.800
right that's just one example it could be your&nbsp;
kids are really well disciplined in the restaurant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:22.160
which is only occasionally when somebody comes&nbsp;
up and says you and your kids are great i'm like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:27.520
you should've saw them last week but you know&nbsp;
what we tell them you know we we follow jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:32.400
and as we submit to jesus and we raise our kids&nbsp;
unto god we teach them respect to their parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.200
which we're going to talk about next week come&nbsp;
back next week we're going to talk about the kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.720
on this but we get to point everybody&nbsp;
to jesus through our relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.880
with our spouse so let me just kind of summarize&nbsp;
this up and i think verse 33 does this right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:54.560
to sum up each one of you is to love his wife&nbsp;
as himself and the wife is to respect her

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:02.560
so how does this all come together know everybody&nbsp;
hasn't been here but over the last three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:07.440
messages that we've talked to in this here's&nbsp;
kind of the titles all pushed together in one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:14.160
statement be careful how you live by being filled&nbsp;
with the spirit and being united in marriage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:20.000
as one under christ that's really where paul's&nbsp;
getting at be careful how you live knowing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.200
today is not guaranteed tomorrow is definitely&nbsp;
not guaranteed next moment's not guaranteed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.480
spirit-filled which means really you're you're&nbsp;
in a great relationship with god and you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:38.080
expressing it through thanksgiving your expression&nbsp;
of joy you're expressing it through submission and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.120
one for relationship in your marriage that's&nbsp;
what paul's getting at and it extends more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.280
to the kids next week and then into your work&nbsp;
but that's where paul's getting at this point

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.320
so when you think of the wives and husbands being&nbsp;
filled with the spirit they have the example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:54.320 --> 00:33:00.880
of christ but why in the church right now when i&nbsp;
looked at it just the other day big 1 of marriages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:07.120
in the church are our broken helmets right&nbsp;
divorce it happens and so here's my thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:12.240
it's not to knock that at all what it's to say&nbsp;
is we're foolish to think it can happen to us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.360
you made me listen to this message today and you&nbsp;
guys were high fiving each other when you walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.320
out we're killing this this is great everything&nbsp;
he said we're doing but what about next week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:28.480
when life gets tough so this is the point&nbsp;
where how do we respond today's message how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:36.320
do we respond to this we have to start with&nbsp;
the number one most important relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:42.720
and that is our relationship with jesus so as we&nbsp;
take time for invitation i want to just take a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.920
minutes i don't really do this every week but i'm&nbsp;
going to take just a few minutes i want you guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:52.000
to close your eyes i want you to take some time&nbsp;
to think through what god has taught you what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.320
god is speaking about i'm hoping to kind of walk&nbsp;
you through that a little bit but i want you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:04.560
take some time just in your mind in your heart ask&nbsp;
this question is my relationship with jesus good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:12.320
is it healthy is it a way in which would honor my&nbsp;
spouse or any other relationship that i have or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:19.360
it would express in such a way to show other&nbsp;
people jesus and i know when a room decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.880
somebody doesn't know jesus and what i would say&nbsp;
with that is that's not me pressuring you into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.800
this or this is me saying this that's where you've&nbsp;
got to start if you want to work on relationships&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.640
in your life it starts with a relationship with&nbsp;
jesus it starts with the original jesus so i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:39.360
want to shout out this if you don't know jesus&nbsp;
i want you to consider giving your life to jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.240
i want you to come talk to me after service i&nbsp;
want to share more detail of what it means to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:51.600
follow jesus it's not difficult to come to jesus&nbsp;
it's not difficult to follow jesus but it is so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:56.800
important that we make a decision too because&nbsp;
i think i've been there before i spent a year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:01.840
in church before i ever followed jesus because&nbsp;
i thought i had to get everything right my life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.520
but you don't so i want to challenge you today&nbsp;
if you haven't given up to jesus that you do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.720
maybe today during this this kind of invitation&nbsp;
which is a time for us to reflect on what god's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:18.080
taught us maybe you do give your life to jesus&nbsp;
you say these things god i give my life to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.400
i repent of my sins i don't want to&nbsp;
follow you it's as simple as that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.040
surrendering your life to me but maybe&nbsp;
you've already surrendered your life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.400
to jesus and this is maybe what you need to&nbsp;
process through during the time of invitation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:38.240
god as a husband or as a wife am&nbsp;
i honoring you on how i'm living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:46.000
through submission or maybe it's through&nbsp;
the way i love my wife and sacrificially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.440
serve her and if maybe you're struggling in there&nbsp;
i just pray for you to repent and turn to god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:55.760
give that to you and i challenge if you have&nbsp;
a spouse in this room or maybe your spouse is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:01.520
serving children's i just i encourage you to&nbsp;
pray for them pray with them during the summer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:08.480
meditation to be better for each other be better&nbsp;
in relationships with jesus and be for each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:14.640
because i'm telling you it will transform&nbsp;
your marriage if you listen to jesus

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.520
so i'm going to pray as i pray our man will lead&nbsp;
us in a time of worship again just take some time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.800
to reflect and ask god what he's calling&nbsp;
you to do i'm going to be up here up front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.720
come see me if you want me to pray with you&nbsp;
if you've got questions about following jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:35.600
because i want you to know who jesus is&nbsp;
and i want you to know that you're here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.040
to walk through life in a new life&nbsp;
so let's pray lord jesus we love you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:48.160
god i am thank you for your word because i&nbsp;
know it's true lord i'm thankful that you give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.840
us guidance for how to live our relationships&nbsp;
or just outside our relationship with you and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:00.240
what i was challenged this week the lord if i'm&nbsp;
struggling in even my own marriage or any other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:05.280
relationship that i have lord that i first need&nbsp;
to come to you and get that relationship right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.360
forward and then come back and address the&nbsp;
issues of the problems that we may be facing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:18.000
because the lord i know you will give us guidance&nbsp;
and wisdom to love the other person in a way that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.360
lord you love them lord i just think about your&nbsp;
sacrifice on the cross lord you did not hold back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:32.640
anything to show your love and your mercy and&nbsp;
your grace to us so lord why would i withhold that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:40.240
to my spouse or to a friend or to love when&nbsp;
you gave so lord i pray during this time of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:45.120
invitation we will open our hearts to repent&nbsp;
turn to you ask for forgiveness and guidance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:59.920
lord to move forward in a way that's good&nbsp;
for us and it's better for those around us
