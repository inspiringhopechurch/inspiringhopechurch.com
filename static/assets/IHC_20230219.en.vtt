00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.310
Okay, we're gonna start today.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.039
We, um, we've been having
technical issues with our videos

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.090
and so a lot of times our videos.

00:00:09.764 --> 00:00:12.434
Cue and I'm know what's going on and
I'm like looking up and I don't know

00:00:12.434 --> 00:00:14.774
where a timer's at, and I'm, I'm, I
don't know what to do with myself.

00:00:14.774 --> 00:00:15.375
That's what happens.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:19.064
See, things need to change occasionally
in your life so that you don't get

00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:21.195
used to routine and comfortable.

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:22.725
I know that that's at least for me.

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:27.134
So, um, we're gonna go ahead and,
and jump in and get started today.

00:00:27.134 --> 00:00:30.585
So if you haven't been with us,
we have been walking through

00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:32.085
for a little while, at least.

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:36.375
Uh, the book of second Timothy,
we took a break during Christmas.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.820
Uh, and came back into the new year
and did a few different messages.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.470
But we are finishing, if you've been with
us, we are finishing second Timothy today.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.060
Um, and as a church, we've, we've
walked through, um, a lot of books.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.500
So Ephesians, first, Timothy, second,
Timothy, Jonah, a couple other ones.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.910
No, we did not go through acts.

00:00:54.915 --> 00:00:58.450
We started to acts, we started to
ax in our home group when we started

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.920
the church, but we never finished.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.460
We got to like chapter
nine and we stopped.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.230
So we did start that though.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.520
Um, so today we should be
completing second Timothy.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.390
And, uh, so just to kind of catch
you up a little bit on really a

00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:16.020
little bit about this book, this is
Paul the Apostle writing to his True

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.640
Son in the Faith Timothy, and it's
kind of his last letter to Timothy.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.820
Um, and a couple of things that
stand out to me with this, right?

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.360
His last letter focus on
encouraging Timothy to accept

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.370
and fulfill his call in his.

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:34.315
To endure suffering that comes along
with being a follower of Christ and to

00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:38.555
deal with the corrupt false teachers
that were hindering the church in Eph.

00:01:39.615 --> 00:01:44.385
And so he's coming to the end of this
letter and, uh, he begins to really list

00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:47.805
a lot of names of people, and you're
gonna hear a lot of different names.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.145
And as we begin to look at this, we
can't really deal with every single

00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:54.735
name in the text, but we're gonna
highlight several of them and see.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.360
, um, how these different people
affected Paul or were related to Paul.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.240
But one of the things you're gonna
see here is that these people

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.470
were either, um, positive, uh, to
Paul, were encouraging to Paul, or

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.480
they were not encouraging to Paul.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.840
And, uh, I've heard this quote
several times, and this is what

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.070
first came to mind when I read this
text, is that two true friends are

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.870
those who are walking into your.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.700
when everyone else is walking out.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.720
So true friends.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.710
Are those walking into your life
when everyone else is walking out?

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.360
And so Paul is in prison writing this
letter, and he begins to describe

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.810
people that have walked out of his
life and he's beginning to describe

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.080
people that have walked into his
life and how important they were and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.580
ultimately how important God was.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.990
So let me just start with this question.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.420
Have you ever had moments in your
life where you felt like that people

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.890
ab abandoned you, that you felt.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.150
Anybody.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.350
Okay.

00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:48.950
A couple of you.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.700
Yes.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.800
I think a lot of us have
probably had that moment in our

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.390
life where we felt abandoned.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.500
People have left us.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.520
We felt all alone.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.200
But let me just ask this question.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.170
In those moments, did you have a
couple of friends or a couple of

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.710
people in your life that stuck
around and actually encouraged you?

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.940
I would say most of us would probably
say we've had those difficult moments

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.480
where we felt abandoned, but yet it seems
like God's placed a couple of people.

00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:13.755
That were key to our lives.

00:03:13.755 --> 00:03:16.275
In those moments, Paul would
say the same thing, and we're

00:03:16.275 --> 00:03:17.745
gonna see that again today.

00:03:17.985 --> 00:03:19.905
How he could relate with us in that.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.515
And just a couple for you guys
even to know, for me, there's two

00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:24.825
points in my life that are critical
where I felt like I was abandoned.

00:03:24.825 --> 00:03:28.125
Number one, interestingly enough,
was before I gave my life to Christ.

00:03:28.515 --> 00:03:31.395
Uh, and this is, this is where
you wonder, why am I a pastor?

00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:36.135
Uh, I had started dating my wife,
Brittany, and all of her Christian friends

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:37.815
didn't like it, which makes sense, right?

00:03:37.815 --> 00:03:40.125
I was not saved, I didn't
know Jesus and she did.

00:03:40.515 --> 00:03:45.015
Um, but rather than staying around
and encouraging us to know the

00:03:45.015 --> 00:03:47.895
Lord, they begin to abandon us.

00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:51.135
And that actually kind of proved my
point of why I didn't like Christians

00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:53.025
in the first place, uh, as an believer.

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:56.235
Uh, but there was one person that stuck
around out of her friends that I believe

00:03:56.235 --> 00:04:00.135
was a key part of me coming to faith
in Christ because he stuck around now.

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:03.265
He didn't accept and, and agree
with the way we were living.

00:04:04.165 --> 00:04:07.315
but he was still there as someone
who didn't ab abandon in us.

00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:10.315
I believe that that person was critical
in my life to come into faith in Christ.

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:12.745
Another moment was when
I surrendered ministry.

00:04:13.015 --> 00:04:15.565
You know, you would think that would
be an exciting time, but when you

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.945
begin to share with family and friends,
they tend to begin to be critical and

00:04:19.945 --> 00:04:23.575
question why you would do that and
why you would leave your job, your

00:04:23.575 --> 00:04:25.355
corporate world to go into ministry.

00:04:25.585 --> 00:04:27.325
Um, and I remember
those days feeling very.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.729
For something I thought was very good.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.919
Um, so I understand this idea of being
abandoned and it's hard, but what I

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.530
love about Paul, and I'm gonna say this
and we're gonna jump into the text,

00:04:37.859 --> 00:04:42.960
Paul will remind us, and it reminds
us in this text that the Lord stood

00:04:42.965 --> 00:04:44.640
with him when everybody else didn't.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.929
The Lord strengthened him and
encouraged him, even though there

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:50.370
weren't people there to do that.

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:52.919
And I believe we'll take that home
today as an encouragement to us.

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.650
So let's jump into this
text, second Timothy chapter.

00:04:56.895 --> 00:04:59.835
We're gonna be starting in verse
nine, and here's what it says.

00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:01.125
It says, make every effort again.

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:02.294
He's speaking to Timothy.

00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:07.275
Make every effort to come to me
soon because Dimus has deserted.

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.570
Since he loved this present world and
has gone to Thessalonika, Christians

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.869
has also gone to Glacier Titus Tilia,
also Luke, or only Luke is with me.

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.229
Bring Mark with you for, he
is useful to me in ministry.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.659
I have sent  to Ephesus.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.309
When you come, bring a cloak.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.900
Uh, that I left in tr as with
Carpus, as well as the scrolls,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.130
especially the Parchments.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.510
Alexander the Coppersmith did
great harm to me, and the Lord will

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.219
repay him according to his works.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.539
Watch out for him yourself because
he strongly opposed our words.

00:05:43.094 --> 00:05:47.895
At my first defense, no one stood
with me and everyone deserted me.

00:05:48.284 --> 00:05:49.995
May it not be counted against them.

00:05:50.325 --> 00:05:53.114
But the Lord stood with me and
strengthened me so that I might

00:05:53.114 --> 00:05:57.315
fully preach the word to all the
Gentiles so that they might hear it.

00:05:57.734 --> 00:06:01.724
So I was rescued from the lion's
mouth and the Lord rescued me from

00:06:01.755 --> 00:06:05.115
every evil work and will bring me
safely into his heavenly kingdom.

00:06:05.445 --> 00:06:07.245
To him be the glory forever and ever.

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:12.344
Then he finishes this book with
this Greek, Priscilla and Aquila,

00:06:12.495 --> 00:06:16.715
and the household of vociferous
rais has remained at Corinth.

00:06:17.145 --> 00:06:17.674
I left.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.140
Trove Mesis.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.430
I think this is what it is.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.710
Sick at Mi Miletus.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.050
Make every effort to come before
Winters greets you, as does Putins,

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.710
Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers
and sisters and the Lord be with

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.480
your spirit and grace be with you.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.570
This is the moment I know if I ask
somebody to read this text, they

00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:41.170
would say, no . Because everybody
re everybody when you say that, they

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.160
read quickly down and they go, I
can't say these words neither can I.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.440
You're in the same book with
me, but we, we tried this.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.850
So let's pray before we jump in.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.740
So, Lord Jesus, thank you for this word.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.150
And Lord, I just pray that this book
has been an encouragement to our church.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.420
Lord, I pray that this text today will,
um, allow us to see deep DePaul's life

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:07.000
and the end of his life, Lord, and
see how you provided a few people.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.760
And also, Lord, you provided your
presence to encourage him even

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.390
when he was in prison, even when
he was left by almost everyone.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.910
Lord, I pray today that we leave out
changed by this text, Lord, knowing

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.900
that you love us, that you will
never leave us or forsake us, and

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.950
that you are always there with us no
matter what is going on in our lives.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.780
And so, Lord, we just pray
this near Heaven name.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.550
So we're gonna start by kind of
walking through this and, and, and

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.730
seeing the different people that
Paul was addressing and speaking to.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:44.370
And so the first group that we're gonna
see is those who abandon or left Paul,

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.659
and I'll even describe it this way, those
who abandon or were sent out by Paul.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.110
Um, and so we see in this first verse
where he's speaking to Timothy to say,

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.880
make every effort to come to me soon.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.030
Well, there's a couple of reasons why
he wanted him to come to him soon, and

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.840
we're gonna see later on where he mentions
that winter is coming and he's cold.

00:08:01.275 --> 00:08:02.474
And so he needs his cloak.

00:08:02.534 --> 00:08:03.435
That's one of the things.

00:08:03.555 --> 00:08:07.665
And so he also not only needs the cloak,
but he also mentions later on, uh, that

00:08:07.665 --> 00:08:11.805
he needs, um, his scrolls, which we
would know as like the Old Testament

00:08:11.805 --> 00:08:13.724
scripture and paper to write on.

00:08:13.724 --> 00:08:17.655
And one of the pictures that I love
that Paul's asking for, obviously

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:20.835
he's wanting something to keep him
warm, but he's wanting God's word at

00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:24.025
the end of his life and he's wanting
pen and paper so that he can continue

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.605
to encourage people, tell his last.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.219
If that's not a picture of somebody
who is finishing his race, as he said

00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:32.169
last week, he's finishing his race.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.000
He's wanting to finish strong.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.809
He's wanting to impact as many
people as possible, and I love that.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.829
Those are the things that Paul
asks for from Timothy, but he also

00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:43.240
says for Timothy to come soon.

00:08:44.085 --> 00:08:48.105
because of another reason, right at
the end of his life, he started having

00:08:48.105 --> 00:08:52.335
people that were leaving him or, or as
we see here, they begin to desert him.

00:08:52.335 --> 00:08:55.725
And so we see DMIs was the
one that had deserted him.

00:08:56.115 --> 00:08:59.115
Um, and some of them also left
for other ministry assignments.

00:08:59.385 --> 00:09:01.365
So let's just dive into DMIs here.

00:09:01.365 --> 00:09:02.775
He says this in verse 10.

00:09:03.015 --> 00:09:04.755
He says, DMIs has, has
deserted me since he.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.739
This present world, right?

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.550
If you go and look in scripture, Demus
was mentioned three times in the word,

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:16.349
and most of the time Demis was mentioned
alongside Luke and at times Mark as

00:09:16.354 --> 00:09:18.420
co-laborers with Paul in the ministry.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.880
He was valuable to Paul for many,
many years, and in this season,

00:09:23.969 --> 00:09:29.819
dimiss decided to desert Paul to to
leave him and to go because he was

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.439
drawn away by the present world.

00:09:31.439 --> 00:09:32.069
What would that.

00:09:32.595 --> 00:09:34.215
and, and I begin to just dive in.

00:09:34.215 --> 00:09:34.905
What would that mean?

00:09:34.905 --> 00:09:39.345
And we know back, if we go back to chapter
three, we see that Paul mentions people,

00:09:39.825 --> 00:09:43.275
uh, he says, as hard times come, this
is in verse one of, of chapter three.

00:09:43.485 --> 00:09:46.245
But you know, there's hard times
will come in the last days for people

00:09:46.245 --> 00:09:50.445
will be lovers of self and lovers
of money and boastful and proud.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:55.035
And so what we see with DMAs is, this is
probably where he related, he began to be.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:56.505
Focused.

00:09:56.895 --> 00:09:59.745
Um, and we think about this, that
whenever we give our lives to

00:09:59.745 --> 00:10:01.605
Christ, here's what we are told.

00:10:01.905 --> 00:10:04.155
Uh, the two greatest commandments
to love the Lord your God with

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.885
are your heart, mind, and soul,
and to love others as yourself.

00:10:07.425 --> 00:10:08.444
And I don't know about you.

00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:10.605
Does anybody struggle with
getting that out of order?

00:10:10.605 --> 00:10:15.015
With loving myself with all my heart,
mind, and soul, loving God when I have

00:10:15.015 --> 00:10:17.324
time and others when it's convenient?

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:19.365
Okay.

00:10:19.395 --> 00:10:19.905
Just me.

00:10:21.194 --> 00:10:21.525
All right.

00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:22.335
I'll preach to myself.

00:10:23.655 --> 00:10:27.045
I can see how Demus could easily
get distracted by this, but

00:10:27.045 --> 00:10:28.245
he didn't only get distracted.

00:10:28.245 --> 00:10:32.204
He began to lean into it and run from
his commitment to Father the Lord.

00:10:32.745 --> 00:10:35.385
And so when we think about this,
his commitment to the ministry

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:39.464
and to Christ became more than he
could handle because it conflicted

00:10:39.464 --> 00:10:42.915
most likely with his personal life,
his schedule, and his desires.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.080
And we think about this and I begin to
be a little bit sad for Dimus and this

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.530
idea of, cuz I know what he's heading
off into, I've been there before and I

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.150
wanna give you this quote by CS Lewis.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.690
Lewis.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:56.980
He says this, he says, aim at heaven
and you'll get earth thrown in.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.100
He says, but if you aim at
earth, you'll get neither.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.620
And the reason why I say this is Dimus
was going to be disappointed when he

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.700
began to pour his life into when he
began to follow the present world.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:11.955
because what do we know
about the present world?

00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:14.235
It will never be fulfilling.

00:11:14.835 --> 00:11:16.545
Why am I saying that?

00:11:17.145 --> 00:11:19.965
I've experienced it even
as a fall of Christ.

00:11:20.115 --> 00:11:22.155
There's moments where I
begin to say, you know what?

00:11:22.155 --> 00:11:24.435
I'm gonna prioritize this and
it's gonna be so important

00:11:24.435 --> 00:11:25.575
to me cuz it's all about me.

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:28.035
And you know what it
has, it's let me down.

00:11:28.215 --> 00:11:29.145
It has let me down.

00:11:29.445 --> 00:11:33.255
And my life before Christ, I had been
let down a lot and so I just wanna

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:35.025
kind of lean into some of those, right?

00:11:35.025 --> 00:11:36.045
So fulfillment.

00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:37.564
This side of heaven will always.

00:11:38.084 --> 00:11:39.375
Leave you wanting more.

00:11:39.464 --> 00:11:40.275
Let's start with money.

00:11:41.175 --> 00:11:44.805
I remember as a kid growing up
and a, as I remember, all of our

00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:48.074
siblings, we wanted to, to have
more money than we had growing up.

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:50.324
And my parents did everything
they could to provide for us.

00:11:50.324 --> 00:11:51.105
I'm so thankful for them.

00:11:51.105 --> 00:11:54.344
But we always had this mindset, we're
gonna get great jobs, make a lot of money,

00:11:54.495 --> 00:11:57.344
and be basically where we don't have need.

00:11:58.245 --> 00:12:03.045
And, uh, I've realized that the more
money that I made, the more I needed.

00:12:04.319 --> 00:12:07.590
And the more I desired for
more, and I was never satisfied.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.030
So let me give you the opposite, right?

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.470
So more money.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.710
And when we're thinking about this, the
worldly things will never satisfy us.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:18.810
But Godly contentment will remind you that
you have more than you will ever need.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.360
more than you will ever need.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.280
I, I'm telling you
this, and this is funny.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.300
I'm probably making about double
what I made about 12, 15 years ago.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.070
Double what I made and
I'm still not satisfied.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.820
What do I mean by this?

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.470
I'm still, it just doesn't matter.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.440
It doesn't matter how much more money I
have, but I'll tell you this, the moment I

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.810
gave my life to Christ, it changed because
it was this idea of man, God has given me.

00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:43.275
And wow, God has provided this.

00:12:43.275 --> 00:12:45.974
And when we started, I always tell people
this, when we started tithing, when we

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:50.865
started giving as a family, God did way
more with the 90% that we got to keep than

00:12:50.865 --> 00:12:52.365
the a hundred percent that we kept before.

00:12:53.055 --> 00:12:54.584
And so I'm just giving
you one example here.

00:12:54.584 --> 00:12:54.854
Money.

00:12:54.859 --> 00:12:57.255
So here's another one cuz I know
everybody loves this power and control.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.984
Everybody wants to have power and
control over their own lives to

00:12:59.984 --> 00:13:01.694
make their own decisions, right?

00:13:01.995 --> 00:13:04.214
But you'll always be left wanting more.

00:13:04.395 --> 00:13:06.255
And I'll even tell you this,
when you think you have.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.579
And then life gives you
a glimpse that you don't.

00:13:12.869 --> 00:13:15.180
It's always frustrating, right?

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.739
And I know some of you've
experienced this, right?

00:13:16.744 --> 00:13:19.319
Health, when you think, oh,
I can control everything.

00:13:19.324 --> 00:13:20.099
No, you can't.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.030
What about a job?

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.300
I mean, guys, you think our jobs
are all secure until the moment

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.760
you get brought in and, and all
of a sudden they need to cut jobs.

00:13:27.525 --> 00:13:28.245
I mean, it's the same thing.

00:13:28.245 --> 00:13:29.295
What about the economy?

00:13:29.745 --> 00:13:32.625
I mean, we all know the economy was great
and then now it's bad, and then it's

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:35.954
great and then it's bad and it's like we,
we, we can't seem to control it, right?

00:13:36.344 --> 00:13:40.425
All these things we think we need
that will provide comfort that

00:13:40.425 --> 00:13:43.484
are worldly things that we think
about that Demis was going after.

00:13:43.484 --> 00:13:47.594
The present world will all leave
us wanting more, but we know this.

00:13:47.964 --> 00:13:50.954
Surrendering to God who is all
powerful gives us fulfillment

00:13:51.104 --> 00:13:54.795
and understanding and peace, even
when we don't feel like we have.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.010
I'll just tell you this, worldly
things will always end up failing you.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.950
And I just really even feel a
little bit sad for Demus cuz

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.000
we don't know his full story.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.890
So he begins to leave Paul and
think about this, Paul's in prison.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.120
Paul's given his life to this ministry and
one of his good co-laborers leaves him.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.820
But here's the cool part about Paul.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.900
Not only do people leave him,
, but then he sends people out.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:19.590
Think about this.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.520
If there's people leaving you, aren't
you gonna wanna keep more of those,

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.820
more other, the people that are around
around and like, Hey, you stay with

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.950
me, you don't go anywhere, right?

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:29.610
No.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:30.210
This is what you see.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:30.840
This is what I love.

00:14:30.845 --> 00:14:33.090
This part here, he says this.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:37.440
He says, um, Christians has gone on to
Galatia and Titus Del Naia, and you think,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.610
well, maybe they decided to do this.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.400
I believe Paul sent them to these places.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.290
So these were not abandonments.

00:14:44.265 --> 00:14:45.525
. These were assignments.

00:14:45.615 --> 00:14:49.605
These were not abandonments the they
were assignments by Paul, so that

00:14:49.975 --> 00:14:54.885
ministry could continue growing despite
what was happening to Paul in prison.

00:14:55.275 --> 00:14:56.475
Let me just tell you this.

00:14:57.075 --> 00:15:00.645
This is Paul modeling for us
as a church to be ascending

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.175
church, I'm gonna say this again.

00:15:02.415 --> 00:15:07.305
This is Paul modeling to us that we should
be ascending church despite those who

00:15:07.305 --> 00:15:09.255
desert us or who's here, or who's not.

00:15:11.205 --> 00:15:12.255
That's a, that's tough.

00:15:12.255 --> 00:15:12.855
I'm just gonna tell you.

00:15:12.855 --> 00:15:15.675
That is tough in ministry
to think about that.

00:15:15.675 --> 00:15:18.765
But as a church, we've committed
to fall, live, serve and expand,

00:15:19.095 --> 00:15:24.075
expanding God's kingdom by multiplying
groups, disciples, and churches.

00:15:24.075 --> 00:15:27.795
If we are committed to that, it's going to
take sacrifice and it's gonna take sending

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.385
people when we don't think we have enough.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.069
I mean, we've experienced
this even as a group.

00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:34.680
We had the group that started as a
church, and then we start this church

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.969
and learn what do we do with this group?

00:15:35.969 --> 00:15:38.520
So we started two and that
was difficult for a season.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.050
And we're still trying
to figure this thing out.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.790
I mean, we just started a
new one here in Hamilton.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.750
How does this work?

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.260
Well, every time we leave a group to
go start another group, do you know

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.160
there's a sense in everybody's heart
of, I don't wanna lose this, but there's

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:53.400
a deeper sense in our hearts that we
wanna reach more people for Christ.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.180
And so the sacrifice of losing some
of the, the deep relationships so that

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.810
we can reach more people are more, I.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:03.540
. So Paul, even in prison, sends
people out to do ministry.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.940
Cuz this is so important for us to hear.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.900
Paul was willing to endure pain and
heartache, to experience God's kingdom.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.640
MedU expand, man.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.460
He models that for us.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:19.260
He models that for Timothy and I think
that is just, it's so challenging.

00:16:20.205 --> 00:16:21.975
. So we see this right first.

00:16:22.485 --> 00:16:25.755
Those that abandoned Paul and
those Paul sent out or left.

00:16:26.145 --> 00:16:30.105
But it really goes from bad to worse
because now we're gonna talk about

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.225
people who harmed Paul and deserted Paul.

00:16:33.315 --> 00:16:34.935
Harmed Paul and deserted Paul.

00:16:34.935 --> 00:16:38.745
I, I would love to just wish this was
a whole chapter about all these people

00:16:38.745 --> 00:16:43.035
that hung around and just like high-fived
Paul and was at his trials, just, you

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:47.715
know, trying to beat down the doors
about release Paul, but in ministry.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.120
More times than not, you're
gonna be facing some of these

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.680
battles that Paul is facing.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.190
So again, let's look at those
who harmed him and deserted him.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.650
Let's, we're kind of jumping
around here, but in verse 14, we

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:02.370
see here, he says, Alexander the
Coppersmith did great harm to me.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.970
and the Lord will pay him according
to his works, watch out for him

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.909
because he strongly opposed our words.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:13.379
So we don't exactly know what harm that
this guy did, but I'm assuming just as

00:17:13.379 --> 00:17:16.319
we kinda look into this text a little
bit more, this probably had to do with

00:17:16.325 --> 00:17:19.710
Paul's imprisonment where he was and the
reason why he was imprison and he was

00:17:19.714 --> 00:17:24.869
telling Timothy, watch out for him cuz
you may join me cuz this guy is not good.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.649
And so he harmed Paul and
that was obviously difficult.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.899
Not only did he have people AB
abandoning him, but they harm.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.715
. And uh, when we look at this a little
bit even deeper, look at verse 16.

00:17:35.985 --> 00:17:40.575
He says that my first defense, so
Paul's in Rome and we know this, trials

00:17:40.575 --> 00:17:42.465
don't just happen one and done, right.

00:17:42.465 --> 00:17:43.245
It's multiple.

00:17:43.485 --> 00:17:46.965
So he says that my first
defense, no one stood by me.

00:17:48.105 --> 00:17:49.335
He didn't say, a few did.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.205
He said, no one.

00:17:50.355 --> 00:17:52.935
So the believers that he had reached
in Rome, the people that he had

00:17:53.085 --> 00:17:58.695
been ministering to, had not shown
up to his defense to stand up with.

00:17:59.835 --> 00:18:04.695
. And so think about this, Paul
is, is at the end of his life,

00:18:04.695 --> 00:18:06.315
he's done a lot of ministry.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.905
He's invested in a lot of people and
he didn't even have people there at his

00:18:10.905 --> 00:18:12.525
own trial trying to help defend him.

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:16.965
But then we see what he says, and this is
something that I think is so important.

00:18:16.965 --> 00:18:18.345
Somebody needs to hear this.

00:18:19.575 --> 00:18:22.335
He says, no one stood by me
and everyone deserted me.

00:18:22.905 --> 00:18:24.585
May it not be counted against them.

00:18:27.389 --> 00:18:30.060
I mean, I'm pretty much
cussing people at that point.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.580
Me, I'm, I know this sounds really bad.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:32.790
Okay.

00:18:32.939 --> 00:18:33.719
No, I'm not.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.899
What I'm saying though is in that
situation, I think a lot of us

00:18:36.899 --> 00:18:38.100
would wanna act totally different.

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:42.840
We would want to, to basically
pray to the Lord, you better

00:18:42.899 --> 00:18:44.850
chastise them in the Jesus name.

00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:46.229
I mean, you better do something.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.649
But he says this, and here's
the reason why I think Paul can

00:18:49.649 --> 00:18:52.919
say this, because Jesus was his.

00:18:54.419 --> 00:18:55.590
Jesus was his model.

00:18:55.709 --> 00:18:56.820
Jesus set the standard.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.470
Do you guys remember Jesus on the cross?

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.760
And he is dying and suffering for
our sins so that we could be saved?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.139
And here's what he says.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.959
Lord, forgive them for
they know not what they do.

00:19:08.129 --> 00:19:11.010
Paul's heard this before and
he's saying the same thing.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.750
And so we look at this
and we say, well, who?

00:19:12.899 --> 00:19:14.129
Why wouldn't they stand with Paul?

00:19:14.129 --> 00:19:14.669
I would say this.

00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:17.250
Maybe they were young believers,
maybe Paul understood that at

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.840
times people make mistakes.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.455
And so he says, To not
count it against him.

00:19:22.455 --> 00:19:24.705
And I think that is
awesome that he does that.

00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:27.645
And it's a challenge to us that
there's going to be people in our

00:19:27.645 --> 00:19:33.435
lives that won't show up in our times
of need, and we need to forgive them.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.105
We need to, to understand and
not count it against them.

00:19:36.765 --> 00:19:40.305
And so whenever I, I said earlier,
uh, if you've had people abandon you

00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:41.655
or desert you friends in difficult.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.530
We need to look at that from a, a
pure mind and heart and understanding,

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.800
um, that sometimes we don't
know what they're going through.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.050
Sometimes we don't
understand their situation.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.900
Um, and so it's, it's
difficult to see this.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.740
So just to kinda see this, at the
end of his ministry, he didn't

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.450
give up right at that moment.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:01.740
He's at his first defense.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.970
Nobody's there.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.860
Why wouldn't he just throw in the towel?

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.600
You know what, let me just recant.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.860
I, I don't believe in Jesus.

00:20:08.475 --> 00:20:10.004
. What if he just, he says, you know what?

00:20:10.004 --> 00:20:10.725
I don't care anymore.

00:20:10.725 --> 00:20:11.445
I don't care to live.

00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:12.735
Just take my life now.

00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:16.185
But one of the interesting
things was, Paul, is he didn't,

00:20:16.365 --> 00:20:17.865
he didn't say, take my life.

00:20:17.925 --> 00:20:19.785
Now, why?

00:20:20.805 --> 00:20:22.125
Why didn't he wave in his faith?

00:20:22.215 --> 00:20:24.524
I believe this is why.

00:20:25.155 --> 00:20:29.955
Because there were still those
who supported Paul, and those

00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:34.155
who supported Paul May be few in
number, but they were greater than

00:20:34.155 --> 00:20:36.105
those of the many that rejected.

00:20:37.274 --> 00:20:38.295
I'll just say this again.

00:20:38.475 --> 00:20:44.325
There are so many people in our lives
that may leave us, they may not accept us.

00:20:44.535 --> 00:20:45.795
They may reject us.

00:20:46.155 --> 00:20:47.865
They, they may desert us.

00:20:48.405 --> 00:20:51.495
We may send them out to do greater
ministry than we'll ever do.

00:20:52.875 --> 00:20:54.705
But those aren't the
people that define you.

00:20:54.705 --> 00:20:59.145
And the fact of like, oh, man, if they're
not here, it's, it's not, it's not good.

00:20:59.145 --> 00:20:59.445
No.

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:01.185
It's the people who stick with you.

00:21:01.395 --> 00:21:05.565
So there were stu, there was a few
people that stuck around with Paul.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.910
Again, they may be few, but they're great.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.500
So let's kind of go back here.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.720
Who stuck around with Paul in verse 11?

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.320
We see this.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.600
He says, only Luke is with me.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.800
Only Lucas is with me.

00:21:16.805 --> 00:21:21.750
If you know any of the story, Luke,
the doctor wrote, um, we got Luke

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.670
the Gospel and then we got Ax.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.050
He wrote both of those books.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.200
And in both of those books, obviously,
uh, he has a lot of history with

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.230
Paul, especially in Ax You'll Sea,
where he traveled a lot with Paul.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:35.980
What we see here at the end of Paul's
life, Luke had not abandoned him.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.900
That I think is so awesome.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.080
It's that Luke stuck around
despite all the things that he went

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.010
through, and he was most likely,
most believed that Luke was the one

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.690
that would listen to Paul speaking.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:50.410
He would write down these letters, and so
maybe Paul couldn't physically write these

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.420
letters, but Luke could write them for.

00:21:53.804 --> 00:21:56.804
, I, I'll just tell you this, this is
a reality to me when we think about

00:21:56.804 --> 00:21:59.085
the people that stick around, and
I want, before I jump even full,

00:21:59.085 --> 00:22:02.655
more onto the more people that stick
around, I, I would say this, that

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:04.304
it's gonna happen in seasons of life.

00:22:04.875 --> 00:22:09.165
Um, we moved here from Oklahoma to plant
this church and we had a ton of friends

00:22:09.165 --> 00:22:12.105
in Oklahoma, and I remember like, it
seemed like the first six or eight

00:22:12.105 --> 00:22:16.245
months I was calling these people all
the time, just checking in on 'em, seeing

00:22:16.245 --> 00:22:17.804
how they're doing, how life's going on.

00:22:17.804 --> 00:22:18.794
But here's what I found.

00:22:19.155 --> 00:22:20.385
Their life's moved on.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.740
and they weren't reaching back out to me.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:28.660
And I had few and few and fewer friends
that knew I was doing to do great ministry

00:22:28.665 --> 00:22:31.590
and, and it was gonna be difficult,
but it seemed like they just forgot me.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.040
They forgot our, our family and our,
our church and what we were doing here.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.810
And, and it began to be disheartening.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.830
And then I was reminded there
was a few people left in Oklahoma

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.180
that would consistently reach out.

00:22:43.305 --> 00:22:45.045
And this is before we'd
really made any friends here.

00:22:45.045 --> 00:22:46.935
So y'all, y'all, I'm not
talking about you guys.

00:22:46.935 --> 00:22:48.825
You guys have now become
that family for us.

00:22:49.275 --> 00:22:52.365
But, but there was a few friends
and those are the friends that have

00:22:52.365 --> 00:22:57.105
stuck around, have been key to us
at times when we've gone back home

00:22:57.105 --> 00:22:58.515
to Oklahoma that we spend time with.

00:22:58.515 --> 00:22:58.905
Why?

00:22:59.395 --> 00:23:00.655
because those people mattered more to me.

00:23:00.795 --> 00:23:03.595
I, I, I had to come to the point
that those people mattered more to

00:23:03.595 --> 00:23:06.205
me than the people that had deserted
us, that had forgotten about us.

00:23:06.535 --> 00:23:08.545
So I can see where Paul's
getting at with this.

00:23:08.635 --> 00:23:10.524
So people just like Luke that hung around.

00:23:10.585 --> 00:23:12.385
And here's another cool redemption story.

00:23:12.385 --> 00:23:13.795
He mentions this to Timothy.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.235
He says, Hey, make sure
you bring Mark with you.

00:23:18.135 --> 00:23:21.345
So if you don't know much about Mark's
story, mark used to go on these missionary

00:23:21.345 --> 00:23:24.585
journeys with Paul, and after that first
missionary journey, there's something

00:23:24.585 --> 00:23:27.795
that happened, most believed that Mark had
kind of went back to his day-to-day life.

00:23:27.795 --> 00:23:30.165
Maybe he did something
wrong in the ministry field.

00:23:30.165 --> 00:23:32.715
And Paul says he does not
want to take Mark with him.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.675
This is back in ActX.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.755
So you wanna go read about that.

00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:39.735
And so what ends up happening,
Barnabas and Mark go one way, and then

00:23:39.735 --> 00:23:41.775
we have Paul and Silas go another.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.350
And we don't hear about Mark anymore
until this moment where he says,

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.480
mark is valuable for ministry to me.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.560
What happened?

00:23:50.129 --> 00:23:51.480
What happened to Mark's story?

00:23:51.629 --> 00:23:54.629
And I, I know the Bible a lot of times
doesn't give us a ton of clarity.

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:55.695
On some of these things.

00:23:55.695 --> 00:23:58.004
So we begin to kind of imagine,
and I started thinking about this.

00:23:58.395 --> 00:24:00.495
Mark went with Barnabas.

00:24:00.975 --> 00:24:03.135
We know Barnabas was the
son of encouragement, right?

00:24:03.284 --> 00:24:07.815
And so I'm guessing that in this travels
with, with Barnabas, that Mark began to

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.675
realize where maybe he had went off wrong.

00:24:09.675 --> 00:24:12.764
Wh where he had maybe had
not followed the Lord away.

00:24:12.764 --> 00:24:13.305
He needed to.

00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:17.294
And Barnabas encouraged him to, to keep
trying, to keep getting better in his

00:24:17.294 --> 00:24:21.165
faith and to keep going and, and to do the
work that the Lord had called him to do.

00:24:21.165 --> 00:24:22.725
Maybe that was a season that Mark.

00:24:23.675 --> 00:24:27.005
so that he would be prepared for the
day that Paul calls on calls on him.

00:24:27.005 --> 00:24:31.265
Again, I love this redemption
story that Paul sees Mark as

00:24:31.785 --> 00:24:34.595
valuable, even though there was
a season of Mark's life that was.

00:24:35.024 --> 00:24:36.465
Not honorable, maybe to the Lord.

00:24:36.885 --> 00:24:40.905
You may be that person in this room
wondering, are you valuable to the Lord

00:24:41.385 --> 00:24:42.735
because of something that you've done?

00:24:43.155 --> 00:24:44.865
Yes, you are.

00:24:44.865 --> 00:24:46.605
And I think we see this story with Mark.

00:24:46.605 --> 00:24:48.555
So Luke had not left him.

00:24:48.675 --> 00:24:50.145
Mark was someone that was valuable.

00:24:50.145 --> 00:24:50.295
Him.

00:24:50.475 --> 00:24:54.345
He was asking for Timothy to
come to be a part of his life.

00:24:54.345 --> 00:24:54.645
Right?

00:24:55.245 --> 00:24:57.254
And then he says, and and goes on.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:01.530
, uh, and he says about the Lord,
and I love this part here, right?

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.740
There's the few people we mentioned,
but then he says, the Lord stood

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.180
with me and strengthened me.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.140
I I'll just tell you this, if
you don't have a Luke, maybe you

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.020
can't call on a mark and you can't
have a Timothy, go get your cloak

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.280
and papers and bring 'em to you.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.510
I don't know If you don't have any
of that, I'll promise you this.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.250
Paul reminds us.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.630
The Lord will stand with you.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.750
The Lord will st.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.960
No matter what you're going through,
if there's, if there's something that

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.660
you're not gonna take from this message,
there's a lot of things maybe you're

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.470
not gonna take from this message.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.780
I hope you take this part right here.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.750
The Lord will strengthen you.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.240
The Lord will never leave
you nor forsake you.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.730
Paul knew that.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:46.920
He says, the Lord stood with me and
I, I love this picture when we see

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.420
that he was so strengthened by the.

00:25:49.365 --> 00:25:51.345
But how did the Lord strengthen Paul?

00:25:51.345 --> 00:25:53.685
And this is something
that will challenge you.

00:25:53.865 --> 00:25:57.315
Like all get out because I'm a selfish
person, which means this, whenever I

00:25:57.315 --> 00:25:59.775
want the Lord to strengthen me, I want
him to strengthen my bank account,

00:26:00.075 --> 00:26:04.005
my health and, and really when we
look at Paul's circumstance, he wants

00:26:04.005 --> 00:26:07.275
to be outta prison, but he doesn't
say that the Lord strengthened him.

00:26:07.275 --> 00:26:08.895
Any one of those three areas.

00:26:09.375 --> 00:26:11.385
He actually strengthened him to do what?

00:26:11.685 --> 00:26:13.725
He gave them the strength
to fill his calling.

00:26:14.085 --> 00:26:15.165
And it says this.

00:26:15.495 --> 00:26:16.725
It says that he might.

00:26:18.075 --> 00:26:24.205
Able to fully preach the word and so
that the Gentiles might hear the strength

00:26:24.524 --> 00:26:29.054
that the Lord gave him in prison was
to not get out of prison, but to make

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:30.465
a difference for the kingdom of God.

00:26:31.875 --> 00:26:34.814
I don't know what you're going through
or what you've struggled with in the

00:26:34.814 --> 00:26:38.575
past and who's abandoning you, but
I'll just tell you Paul's challenge

00:26:38.575 --> 00:26:40.754
here, and maybe this is gonna be harsh.

00:26:41.685 --> 00:26:44.475
The strength that you need
from the Lord may not be for.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:47.910
, but the one that you might impact.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:54.840
I think at times we, we selfishly
pray over and over again and I

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.840
tell you this, cast your cares upon
the Lord cuz he does care for you.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.790
But when we, we pray, I believe that more
of our prayers should look like this.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:09.510
A guy who would model the need of,
of God to literally heal him, take

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.080
him outta prison and, and change
his life, didn't care about any of.

00:27:14.055 --> 00:27:16.875
He's a guy that said,
no, it's about others.

00:27:17.175 --> 00:27:19.635
So the strength that God
gave him was for others.

00:27:19.815 --> 00:27:20.745
And here's the cool part.

00:27:20.865 --> 00:27:25.245
I don't have time to go to all of them,
but if you go back to the Book of Acts,

00:27:25.245 --> 00:27:30.705
you'll see three different places in Acts
18 where the Lord, uh, strengthened Paul.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.230
While he was in Corinth.

00:27:32.379 --> 00:27:35.440
You'll also see in Acts
23, the same thing.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.860
And then in Acts 27, whenever
Paul was on the ship and it had

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.139
wrecked, God encouraged him there.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.330
So we see three different
instances in the Bible where it

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.190
says, the Lord strengthened Paul.

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.080
The Lord strengthened Paul.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.820
The Lord strengthened Paul.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.940
This was not the first instance
At the end of his life, God

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.170
finally showed up for Paul.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.560
God showed up for Paul
throughout his whole life.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:01.320
So to me, if God will show up
for Paul, He'll show up for you.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.000
Maybe somebody needs to hear that.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.830
God will show up for you.

00:28:04.919 --> 00:28:06.270
He will strengthen you.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:12.990
He will encourage you whenever you
need it most, and I, I think this is

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:16.560
so encouraging to all of us, and it
should be right at the end of his life.

00:28:17.895 --> 00:28:20.475
As Paul's concerned, not
for himself, but for others.

00:28:20.955 --> 00:28:24.735
So as we see these last couple verses
here before we get to the ending, um,

00:28:24.795 --> 00:28:29.835
in 17 and 18, uh, at the back end, he
says this, he says, so I was rescued

00:28:29.835 --> 00:28:33.975
from the lion's mouth and the Lord
rescued me from every evil work to bring

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.685
me safely into his heavenly kingdom.

00:28:35.985 --> 00:28:38.925
To him be the glory forever and ever.

00:28:39.315 --> 00:28:39.765
Amen.

00:28:40.545 --> 00:28:44.175
Ultimately, let me just kind of
summarize this as quickly as I possibly.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.129
. Basically, this is what Paul's saying.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.080
He knew that he would not be taken
one second earlier from this world

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.669
before his ministry was fulfilled.

00:28:55.379 --> 00:28:56.399
Where do you see this at?

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.689
I want you to see this.

00:28:57.899 --> 00:29:01.500
The Lord will rescue me
from every evil work.

00:29:03.645 --> 00:29:04.695
Paul's life's not done.

00:29:04.725 --> 00:29:05.955
What he's saying is, I'm in prison.

00:29:05.955 --> 00:29:07.095
I know I'm at the end of my life.

00:29:07.365 --> 00:29:11.415
He will rescue me from every evil
work and will bring me safely

00:29:11.415 --> 00:29:12.285
into the kingdom of heaven.

00:29:12.705 --> 00:29:13.515
In his timing.

00:29:13.605 --> 00:29:14.535
That's what he's saying in his timing.

00:29:14.655 --> 00:29:15.735
Why do you believe that?

00:29:15.735 --> 00:29:19.155
Philippians 1 21, he's said
this in Philippians 1 21.

00:29:19.155 --> 00:29:22.185
For me to live as Christ
and to die is gain.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:27.120
and if you go into more of Philippians,
it's this idea of for him to die is

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.680
actually better cuz he gets to go spend
eternity with God forever and, and avoid

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.650
all the pain and suffering and all the
people that's ever ab abandoned him.

00:29:34.655 --> 00:29:39.060
All that suffering that he said with,
he could avoid all that, but him staying

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.930
was for the benefit of the Gentiles,
the people that had never heard.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.760
And, and I look at this and
I'm so challenged that Paul

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.830
understood this statement, and
you need to hear this statement.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:56.160
You will not live a day longer, a second
longer than the Lord has planned for you.

00:29:56.879 --> 00:29:59.340
And so this is what I, I
challenged so many times.

00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:04.350
If you are breathing today,
if you are here today, God is

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:05.610
saying He has not done with you.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.770
And so you know he's not done with you.

00:30:07.889 --> 00:30:11.760
He's not done with working through you
so that other people can come to know.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.840
I, I tell you, that's the most
beautiful thing that's been in my life.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.090
After I gave my life to Christ,
and I begin to dive into his word,

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.420
and I begin to understand how the
Lord had provided so much for me.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:28.230
I couldn't help but be sent out to go make
a difference for somebody else's life.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.240
That's why I'm in Hamilton, Ohio.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.620
If I wanted the easy life and to just
wait for the Lord to come back, or for

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:40.230
heaven to come to me, I would've just
sat in the back pews of where I got save.

00:30:40.709 --> 00:30:43.860
And came every Sunday
and just enjoyed service.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.310
That's what it would've done.

00:30:47.639 --> 00:30:50.790
If it was all about me,
that's what it would've done.

00:30:51.419 --> 00:30:56.879
But just like Paul, we fight just
like Paul, we suffer for the sake

00:30:57.179 --> 00:30:59.490
of the gospel for those to hear.

00:31:01.169 --> 00:31:05.820
So Paul says this to be all
glory to God forever and ever.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:12.300
Paul never let the cares of the world,
the abandonment of his friends and the

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:16.440
laborers maybe that he had to hinder
him from fulfilling his ministry.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.090
Neither should we.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.420
These last few verses, I'm not gonna
really walk through, but he greets

00:31:24.425 --> 00:31:28.200
all these different peop people and,
and tells Timothy to say hi for me.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:28.409
Right?

00:31:28.409 --> 00:31:29.129
That's basically what it is.

00:31:29.129 --> 00:31:30.180
There's a couple people that are sick.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.220
He's telling Timothy about,
make sure you take care of.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.370
That's the general sense
of the end of this letter.

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:39.510
So there were other people that wasn't
in Paul's life where he was in Rome that

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.920
were still important to him as well.

00:31:41.639 --> 00:31:44.310
But let me just kinda give you
these last final statements.

00:31:45.315 --> 00:31:49.754
Paul's final farewell to Timothy
and those he was writing to seems

00:31:49.754 --> 00:31:51.975
a little bit doom and gloom because
the majority of the things that we

00:31:51.975 --> 00:31:53.655
talked about were difficult things.

00:31:53.655 --> 00:31:57.555
People deserting him, abandoning
him, and even the difficult things

00:31:57.555 --> 00:32:01.635
of sending people out of his
life, that seems difficult for us.

00:32:01.635 --> 00:32:04.095
That doesn't seem
exciting to be a part of.

00:32:04.965 --> 00:32:10.455
Um, but he spoke some amazing truths to us
and I think to Timothy, and this is what

00:32:10.455 --> 00:32:12.345
he says, people will come and go in your.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.750
But the Lord will never
leave you nor forsake you.

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.470
He will strengthen you and
stand by you no matter what

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.400
you're walking through in life.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.800
So there's two things during an invitation
that I want to challenge you with.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.550
Again, imitation is an opportunity
to reflect on what you heard today

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:30.240
and something for you to take
home, uh, and and to begin to live

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.710
out and to apply to your life's.

00:32:32.115 --> 00:32:35.535
So these two things I hope you take
away from this section a Paul's word,

00:32:35.595 --> 00:32:40.995
number one, fulfilling your calling and
purpose in life will come with sacrifice.

00:32:40.995 --> 00:32:44.025
I'm gonna say this again, fulfilling
your calling and your purpose

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:47.175
in life will require sacrifice.

00:32:48.255 --> 00:32:53.205
There's times where I think it's easier
to just talk about all the great things

00:32:53.955 --> 00:32:58.815
and not recognize the difficulty that
will come in serving the Lord Paul.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:03.120
Last letter and last words
tell us it's difficult.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.159
There was sacrifice, right?

00:33:05.939 --> 00:33:10.470
So it may seem, and it may be people
leaving you to serve somewhere else

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:14.790
and may be people abandoning you
that cause you a lot of suffering.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:19.530
So when these times come and they
will let the Lord strengthen you,

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:20.850
maybe you need to hear that today.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.070
Let the Lord St.

00:33:22.845 --> 00:33:24.105
Be prepared for this.

00:33:24.165 --> 00:33:31.544
Number two, God will and has, and if
he hasn't, he will give you a few good

00:33:31.544 --> 00:33:35.084
friends and co-laborers who will stick
by your side through the thick and thin.

00:33:35.175 --> 00:33:36.885
I think that's something
I've learned in Paul's life.

00:33:36.945 --> 00:33:39.225
Paul did not do ministry alone.

00:33:40.334 --> 00:33:41.385
He raised up leaders.

00:33:41.415 --> 00:33:43.334
He invited them on
missionary journeys with him.

00:33:43.485 --> 00:33:44.774
He suffered alongside them.

00:33:44.774 --> 00:33:44.925
He.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:49.830
What it was like to follow Jesus
and some of these friends stood

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:53.490
with him until the end, God will
bring those people around you.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.010
Let me just challenge you with this.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:34:02.760
Don't let the difficulties in your
life, don't let the enemy fool you into

00:34:02.939 --> 00:34:05.220
thinking that everyone's abandoned you.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:06.540
It's a lie.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.130
Don't let the enemy fool you
that the Lord has abandoned you.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:12.389
It's not.

00:34:16.529 --> 00:34:19.889
Remember that the Lord has
provided this church, and this

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:20.969
is, this is just a reminder.

00:34:21.209 --> 00:34:22.020
We are a church.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.679
We are the body of Christ here
to bear one another's burdens.

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:30.540
So if you don't know the people around
you, I pray that you do because this

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.069
is where we need to be strengthened.

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:35.189
There's days where I'm gonna
be struggling and I need

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.259
somebody to come and lift me up.

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:39.219
And there's days where you're gonna be.

00:34:40.125 --> 00:34:44.685
And you need me or someone else to come
alongside you and lift and encourage

00:34:44.685 --> 00:34:48.435
you up, to let you know you're not
alone, that God still has a plan and

00:34:48.435 --> 00:34:50.804
a purpose in your life to fulfill.

00:34:50.835 --> 00:34:52.545
Fulfill amazing calling.

00:34:54.165 --> 00:34:57.705
There's something I was mentioned in,
in invitation, and I mentioned it every

00:34:57.705 --> 00:35:01.275
week, and I feel like sometimes it may
go on deaf ears because many people that

00:35:01.275 --> 00:35:04.935
I know that walk in these doors at one
point has given their lives to Jesus.

00:35:05.565 --> 00:35:08.415
You've, you've set a prayer, you've
committed your life, you've been

00:35:08.415 --> 00:35:12.045
baptized, you, you've come to church.

00:35:12.825 --> 00:35:15.825
And I don't ever want that to kind
of go over your head as though you

00:35:15.825 --> 00:35:16.815
know, you're not speaking to me.

00:35:17.444 --> 00:35:20.625
And the reason why I say that is I think
at times we can have a moment in our

00:35:20.625 --> 00:35:26.265
life where we set a prayer, but we've
lived our life without full surrender.

00:35:27.645 --> 00:35:28.605
And I'm gonna say this again.

00:35:28.634 --> 00:35:31.634
There's sometimes where we've
said a prayer, but we've not

00:35:31.634 --> 00:35:32.765
lived our life in full s.

00:35:34.035 --> 00:35:35.145
And maybe that's you today.

00:35:35.145 --> 00:35:38.685
Maybe that's you, where you understand
the truth of the gospel, but you have not

00:35:38.685 --> 00:35:40.334
fully experienced the truth of the gospel.

00:35:40.604 --> 00:35:44.234
I think days like today are a day
that you can repent and turn to

00:35:44.234 --> 00:35:46.214
the Lord and say, Lord, no more.

00:35:46.214 --> 00:35:47.685
I don't wanna live the second rate life.

00:35:47.685 --> 00:35:51.645
I don't wanna live the life that
has so distracted me away from

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:53.265
experiencing your best for me.

00:35:54.105 --> 00:35:57.855
And maybe that's you and I just pray
that today you repent of your sins

00:35:57.855 --> 00:35:59.265
and you give your life to Jesus.

00:35:59.325 --> 00:36:01.904
If you have already given your life
to Jesus and you've just walked away

00:36:01.904 --> 00:36:05.685
for a season, I pray today that you
repent and you come back to him.

00:36:06.075 --> 00:36:09.555
Cuz there is something amazing
on the other side of repentance

00:36:09.615 --> 00:36:11.024
and forgiveness of the Lord.

00:36:11.044 --> 00:36:15.794
Something beautiful that even me as
a pastor, I have to consistently go

00:36:15.794 --> 00:36:16.964
to the Lord and ask for forgiveness.

00:36:16.964 --> 00:36:21.674
And on the other side of that, oh man,
it's so, The burdens have been removed,

00:36:21.944 --> 00:36:25.455
and I'm so thankful that the Lord
walks with me even in those seasons.

00:36:25.845 --> 00:36:30.944
So as you take time during an invitation
to pray and seek the Lord, I pray

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:32.235
that today's word challenge you.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.785
I pray that you seek the Lord
if there's any air of your heart

00:36:34.785 --> 00:36:38.924
and it needs to, to, to surrender
and ask God to forgive you of.

00:36:38.924 --> 00:36:41.145
And if you need to give your life
to Jesus and you have questions

00:36:41.565 --> 00:36:44.505
about how to do that, if you need
prayer, I'm gonna stand in the back.

00:36:44.505 --> 00:36:46.515
That's where I like to stand so
that you guys don't feel like I'm

00:36:46.515 --> 00:36:47.775
up front and have to pray with you.

00:36:48.105 --> 00:36:48.855
I'd love to talk.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.109
To be able to pray with you and
encourage you as well in your walk.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:52.890
So let's pray.

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:56.460
Lord Jesus, thank you so
much, Lord for this book.

00:36:57.359 --> 00:37:00.810
Lord, I pray that those who are able
to be here for most of the messages

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:03.750
through second Timothy, Lord, I
pray that they have learned so much

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.879
that they have taken away Lord.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:10.950
Um, just this understanding that you
are constantly working through your

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:16.710
Word, through other people to challenge
us in our faith to know you more.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:23.670
To remember our calling and our faith
and our, our, uh, Lord, just, just

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:26.220
our understanding, Lord, that we have
a personal relationship with you.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:30.600
I, I pray that we are encouraged
today, Lord, that you strengthen

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:36.240
those who are weak, that you encourage
those Lord who are struggling,

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.400
maybe who have lost friends.

00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:42.900
Lord, I also am just encouraged,
Lord, by your word, and I pray that

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:47.825
we are all encouraged by your word,
that your presence, Is constantly

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:53.955
spreading in Hamilton, in this
community and around the world, and I

00:37:53.955 --> 00:37:55.185
pray that we get to be a part of it.

00:37:55.455 --> 00:37:58.065
And so, Lord, today, if there's someone
in this room that needs to surrender their

00:37:58.065 --> 00:37:59.295
lives to you, I pray that they do it.

00:37:59.355 --> 00:38:02.325
I pray if there's someone in this
room that needs to just say yes

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:07.904
to you in any way that they do it,
Lord, move only like you can and

00:38:07.904 --> 00:38:08.805
we pray this in your heaven name.

00:38:09.525 --> 00:38:09.884
Amen.
