00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.740
- Hear, O Israel.


00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.200
The Lord our God is one Lord,


00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.520
and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart,


00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.340
and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.


00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.400
And these words which I command thee this day


00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.460
shall be in thine heart,


00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.320
and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children,


00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.960
and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house,


00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.780
and when thou walkest by the way,


00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.260
and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.


00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.340
And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand,


00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.620
and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.


00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.500
And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house,


00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.740
and on thy gates.


00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.840
I guess that means I'm up.


00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.280
I was over helping with coffee.


00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.820
Well, excited to have everybody in service today.


00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.220
If you don't realize this, you're a little bit new here,


00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.460
half our church goes to kids 'cause we love kids.


00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.380
And it's a great thing, and that's one of the things


00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.500
that I so love about our church


00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.900
is we have an amazing children's ministry.


00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.740
And we say this a lot of times.


00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.740
Our children's ministry is not babysitting.


00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.020
Our children's ministry loves these kids


00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.140
like Jesus would love them, teaches them Jesus,


00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.660
and has great games and all kinds of things


00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.020
that connect to who Jesus is.


00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.620
And that's one of my favorite things


00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.440
about seeing our kids out.


00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.340
This isn't just for them to just get watched,


00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.820
this is for them to get invested in.


00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.900
So as much as you guys are here,


00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.100
hopefully I'm praying that I get the opportunity


00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.780
to invest in you as I share,


00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.060
that they're getting invested into as well.


00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.700
And so that just excites me as a pastor


00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.540
to know that we have such a great children's ministry,


00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.780
children's ministry volunteers.


00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.420
So today, we are starting a new series


00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.880
called Practical Evangelism.


00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.660
And I kinda had this series on my heart


00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.500
for the last couple of months,


00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.020
just thinking through this idea


00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.660
as we are just recently moved into the space of the YMCA,


00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.980
and inviting people into our church


00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.580
and what we do as a church and who we are.


00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.380
And here's the one thing that I realized


00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.340
as I began to think about this.


00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.860
Inviting people to church and telling people about Jesus


00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.220
is nerve-wracking sometimes.


00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.220
Anybody agree with me that it gets nerve-wracking?


00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.540
It's a little bit scary sometimes to share your faith


00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.820
because you're afraid to get challenged.


00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.220
You're afraid to get pushed back or to be asked a question


00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.160
you have no clue how to answer.


00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.340
And so as I'm sitting there thinking about this,


00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.000
here's the funny part.


00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.400
I wasn't thinking about you.


00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.880
I was thinking about me, how even as a pastor,


00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.280
it's difficult to share my faith, 'cause it's scary.


00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.840
And I'm afraid even as a pastor,


00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.540
I'm gonna get asked the question


00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.760
that maybe I don't know the answer.


00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.440
And so you may be wondering, oh man,


00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.400
I thought I came to a church that has a pastor


00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.500
that knows everything.


00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.800
I'm letting you in on something.


00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.880
I don't know everything.


00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.480
But let me share with you what I do know


00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.840
and why we need to talk about


00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.560
how to practically evangelize or to share our faith.


00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.460
And I started just really thinking through that this week.


00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.120
God has so changed my life.


00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.080
I remember my life as I began to envision


00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.480
my life before Christ, before I came to know who Jesus was.


00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.760
And my life was pursuing things


00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.160
in which would never fulfill me.


00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.600
I pursued trying to get as much money as I could


00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.360
and get as much position as I could


00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.200
and to do as much things that made me happy


00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.560
and it seems like it never fulfilled my life.


00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.280
And one day, I had a friend in college


00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.740
that invited me to church.


00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.240
And so you know, he invited me multiple times.


00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.900
It wasn't one invite that got me to church,


00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.080
it was multiple invites and multiple times


00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.920
of him just showing me who Jesus was through his life.


00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.360
And one day I finally came to church


00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.360
and I spent a year in the church


00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.560
questioning everything that was being taught


00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.740
before I realized who Jesus was,


00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.180
that Jesus could transform my life,


00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.380
that he could save me from my sins,


00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.900
that he could give me a purpose,


00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.380
and he could give me a relationship


00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.620
with a God who loves me now,


00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.540
and a God who will love me in eternity in heaven.


00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.320
And that was a beautiful picture


00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.220
that I finally, over a couple year period,


00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.300
came to faith in Christ.


00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.100
So when we think about practical evangelism,


00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.480
sometimes it's not just this cut and dry,


00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.540
you say the right things,


00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.940
and people are gonna give their lives to Jesus,


00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.780
or you say the right things,


00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.180
and they're gonna come to church.


00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.740
Many times it's a long-term strategy


00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.220
where we're consistently inviting,


00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.140
we're consistently sharing Christ with people.


00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.820
But I started thinking about why


00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.820
do we need to share our faith?


00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.420
And we'll talk a little bit about that.


00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.020
But I just wanna ask this question.


00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.020
Just to kinda get an idea,


00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.260
'cause I love asking questions to a group.


00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.020
You may not say about this church,


00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.060
but in general, if you've ever attended a church,


00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.240
how many of you attended that church because of an invite?


00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.860
Raise your hand.


00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.540
Okay, so let's say half the church


00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.180
attended a church because of an invite.


00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.780
So that's at least 50% of people wouldn't be at a church


00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.620
because unless they got invited.


00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.060
Now let's think about those of you


00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.380
that have given your lives to Christ,


00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.780
how many of you had to have someone


00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.100
share Christ with you to be saved?


00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.080
Raise your hand.


00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.380
There's some people that just read the Bible


00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.700
and gave their lives to Christ,


00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.100
but for many of us we needed somebody


00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.900
to share the gospel with us.


00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.180
And so I say all that to say is that


00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.120
we need to remember how important it is to share our faith.


00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.100
And so that's why we're gonna take the next three weeks,


00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.220
We'll talk about this and then we'll have one more week


00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.580
after our Family Sunday.


00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.900
And I'm excited about our Family Sunday.


00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.940
In four weeks, we'll have a service where we'll come in,


00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.260
we'll get to talk about what God's been doing in our church,


00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.380
have some testimonies, and we're gonna eat some food


00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.420
and hang out with each other


00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.680
because we need to spend more time


00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.620
getting to know one another.


00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.220
So I'm excited about that in about four weeks.


00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.580
So anyways, as we talk about today


00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.500
how to practically share our faith,


00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.580
we're gonna talk about how to do that


00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.640
and how important it is to do that


00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.680
from a place of following Jesus.


00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.920
As a church, we have a strategy to fulfill our mission.


00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.800
Our mission is to inspire hope


00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.760
by helping people discover God's purpose for their life


00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.120
through a relationship with Jesus.


00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.560
And I'll describe this a different way.


00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.060
Our goal as a church is to help one another,


00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.600
inspire one another, to discover hope in Jesus,


00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.840
to know who Jesus is and how a relationship with him


00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.480
can transform and change our lives.


00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.400
And our strategy to fulfill that is to follow Jesus,


00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.800
live in community, serve those around us,


00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.940
and to expand God's kingdom.


00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.840
So we're gonna use those four pieces


00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.760
to consistently, over these next couple weeks,


00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.240
talk about how we can practically share our faith.


00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.040
And so the first thing that I wanna answer and talk about


00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.360
is why do we need to share our faith


00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.760
and invite people to church?


00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.760
And I kind of asked those couple of questions to you


00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.400
that kind of point us to this direction of,


00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.560
and it reminds me of Romans 10.


00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.640
Romans 10 says this, "But how can they call on him,"


00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.400
speaking of Jesus, "to save them unless they believe in him?


00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.400
"And how can they believe in him


00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.840
"if they have never heard about him?


00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.840
"And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them?"


00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.920
So whenever I ask that question of like,


00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.040
why do we need to share our faith?


00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.980
It sounds logical, right?


00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.220
We share our faith because we want others


00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.320
to experience a relationship with Jesus.


00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.140
And without us taking that responsibility


00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.820
to share our faith, no one will hear.


00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.020
But here's what I wanna share with you,


00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.740
and I'm gonna kinda dive in a few things,


00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.140
and then we're gonna use the word of God


00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.860
to kinda see how Jesus practically shared his faith


00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.040
and how this woman responded.


00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.740
But I want us to hear this,


00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.060
because sometimes we need to hear


00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.540
and understand what we're saying.


00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.100
If you've given your life to Jesus,


00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.220
and you're refusing or you're lacking in sharing your faith,


00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.820
without knowing it, typically this is what we're saying,


00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.740
that Jesus is good enough for me,


00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.720
but he's not good enough for anybody else.


00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.240
Now we may not say that,


00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.800
or even really think that of ourselves,


00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.120
but if we do not share our faith,


00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.040
and we do not invite people to church,


00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.040
then we're saying Jesus is good enough for me,


00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.880
but not for anybody else.


00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.480
And I would even say this,


00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.080
there's many people in this room that I know,


00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.160
I've heard you say, you love Inspiring Hope Church,


00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.020
you love what we're about.


00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.140
But when we don't invite people to Inspiring Hope Church,


00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.060
we're saying, I mean we love what Inspiring Hope Church


00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.420
is doing, but it's not good enough for those I know


00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.260
that haven't been invited to Inspiring Hope.


00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.140
Now, I know that sounds really harsh


00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.220
because most of us probably don't see it that way.


00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.460
I would say this, here's another one,


00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.380
is my comfort is more important than sharing my faith


00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.660
with somebody because they may ask me a difficult question


00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.620
and challenge me.


00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.540
That could be true.


00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.940
Here's another one a lot of times is,


00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.600
somebody else will do it.


00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.820
I mean, you guys know this.


00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.220
You ever walk by a piece of trash,


00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.820
maybe you don't do this, maybe I'm a bad person.


00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.860
You ever walk by a piece of trash


00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.020
that needs to go in the trash can


00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.620
and you walk by and you go, somebody else will do it?


00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.260
I don't do that every time, guys, I promise.


00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.780
But occasionally I'll walk by that trash


00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.460
and I'm like, somebody else will do it.


00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.780
But when we have that mentality,


00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.180
what if somebody else isn't going to invite


00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.780
that one person that you have a connection with


00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.620
at your work or at your school?


00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.340
What if?


00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.380
And so again, we're just challenging that question.


00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.680
Why do we share our faith?


00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.220
And it's because in the end we share our faith to people


00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.280
because one, it's what God has called us to do,


00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.660
but many of us don't like that idea.


00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.820
So here's the other, it's a natural outflow


00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.120
of what Jesus has done for us.


00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.940
And so I'm getting to this point of following Jesus.


00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.060
What does it mean to follow Jesus?


00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.540
It means to know Jesus personally


00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.280
and to consistently spend time with him.


00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.860
And here's my promise.


00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.220
If you are following Jesus,


00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.740
if you have given your life to Jesus,


00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.180
it is a natural outflow to invite somebody


00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.400
into a relationship with Jesus


00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.540
or to invite somebody to church.


00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.860
It is a natural outflow.


00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.080
Why?


00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.980
Because the more and more you know about Jesus,


00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.460
the more and more you are excited


00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.620
for other people to know about Jesus.


00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.320
So, let's answer this question,


00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.160
and then we're gonna dive in.


00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:14.980
I'm trying to set this up.


00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.520
Next week it's gonna look a little bit different,


00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.740
'cause I'm trying to set up the series today.


00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.540
But what is practical evangelism?


00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.740
I just wanted to look up two words,


00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.100
practical and evangelism.


00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.380
Just so you know, in any time that I study for a message,


00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.260
I'm constantly just looking at words.


00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.860
So the word practical is a plan or method


00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.340
that is likely to succeed or be effective


00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.420
in real circumstances.


00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.580
So let me just tell you, in my early days


00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.320
of giving my life to Christ,


00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.740
many times I was challenged to share my faith,


00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.460
but not practically.


00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.400
And it intimidated me, and so I wouldn't share my faith.


00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.320
So I'm hoping that through this series,


00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.380
we'll be able to break that down.


00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.540
Number one, or number two, evangelism is sharing Jesus


00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.720
and who he is and how others can receive


00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.480
the good news of salvation.


00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.020
I was talking to my daughter Peyton about this,


00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.840
what's the translation of practical evangelism?


00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.020
And she said simple faith sharing.


00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.020
Simple faith sharing.


00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.800
And I loved that response back from her


00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.920
because I'm like, she gets it.


00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.900
That it's just some way of simply sharing our faith.


00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.940
And I do wanna make sure I clarify this.


00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.800
I had a professor in my comp one in college.


00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.280
Anybody know what comp one is, English?


00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.760
I'm not a big fan of English.


00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.840
So here's what he would say every single time


00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.280
somebody would ask a question and they didn't understand.


00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.980
Well, comp one, it's not rocket science.


00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.920
You guys should get this.


00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.360
And that made me so mad.


00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.860
But 'cause for me, comp one was rocket science.


00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.320
I'm just being honest, it was.


00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.120
And it made me so mad because he would make me feel dumb.


00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.880
So my goal today is to not make you feel dumb


00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.720
if evangelism to you is rocket science.


00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.560
Because at times it is difficult to understand


00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.800
how to share our faith.


00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.100
So please hear my heart today.


00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.000
I'm not trying to make you feel dumb


00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.100
if you feel like evangelism is rocket science.


00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.500
I'm actually here to encourage you to say I've been there


00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.080
and I'm personally still working through it.


00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.900
So I'm with you in that.


00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.740
So let's jump into this.


00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.500
We're gonna be in John chapter four, John chapter four.


00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.260
And we're gonna zone in on this story


00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
of Jesus and the Samaritan woman.


00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.860
And so you understand, I wanna make sure


00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.920
I can kind of fill everybody in on this.


00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.680
I typically preach through books of the Bible


00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.120
and we walk through verse by verse


00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.960
and we dive into the deep context of it


00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.940
and I love to do that.


00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.680
And we're just gonna take a few weeks


00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.560
to look at practical examples in the Bible


00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.760
so we will not mill this out to a detail


00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.640
of deep theology today.


00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.680
We're really just gonna see what Jesus did


00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.080
in sharing his faith


00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.440
and how the woman responded in sharing hers.


00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.280
So we're just gonna look at the practical side of it.


00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.640
So if you're wondering, where's the depth


00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.380
"Can you explain more to this text?"


00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.060
I may not be doing that today,


00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.900
and it's not because my heart isn't in that,


00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.260
but my heart here today is to help us


00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.980
just look at somebody who lived out their lives


00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.340
and how they simply shared their faith.


00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.420
So what I'm gonna do,


00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.620
and the easiest way to walk through this


00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.540
is that we're going to just walk through verses


00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.360
at a chunk.


00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.060
I'm not gonna read all the verses


00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.480
because then most of us will get half lost in this.


00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.580
And so I'm gonna just kinda jump in


00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.040
and go through this.


00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.300
So the first thing that we're gonna look at


00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.620
is verses one through six.


00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.840
And so this is what it says, John chapter four,


00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.220
verses one through six says,


00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.660
"When Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard,


00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.860
"he was making and baptizing more disciples than John,


00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.340
"though Jesus himself was not baptizing,


00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.780
"but his disciples were,


00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.880
"he left Judea and went to Galilee,


00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.580
"and he traveled through Samaria,


00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.880
"and he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar,


00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.500
"near the property that Jacob had given his son Joseph.


00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.580
"And Jacob's well was there,


00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.240
"and Jesus was worn out from his journey.


00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.520
"He sat down at the well, and it was about noon."


00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.180
So I wanna stop right there.


00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.720
I want you to again look at this as saying,


00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.840
hey, we're looking at a story of how I can learn


00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.720
how somebody else practically shared their faith.


00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.240
I love verse six.


00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.120
Why does somebody wanna know why I love verse six?


00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.680
because Jesus was tired.


00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.140
Anybody tired?


00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.460
I'm truly asking this, anybody tired?


00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:31.900
Yeah, there's a lot of people that wake up every day tired.


00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.240
'Cause I know, trust me, I have four kids,


00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.720
I have two different, well technically


00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.840
I have three different jobs.


00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.200
I understand busy, I understand tired.


00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.900
So to me, when I see Jesus says, "Man, I'm tired,"


00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.440
That comforts me because Jesus knows how I feel


00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.260
if you are tired, if you're worn out.


00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.780
Okay, so I think this is so important to understand this.


00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.000
Something else I want you to see


00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.680
that we don't see in this text specifically,


00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.120
but everything that Jesus did,


00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.640
a lot of times Jesus would do ministry,


00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.960
he would do ministry, and then he would hear these moments


00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.560
where Jesus would take some time away with his father.


00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.920
He would spend time with God.


00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.940
And then he would come back and he would do ministry


00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.900
and he would work hard


00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.840
and he would spend time with his father.


00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.640
I look at one of these instances right here


00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.760
as Jesus coming out of time with his father,


00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.200
and he's exhausted.


00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.800
So I want you to see that first part there


00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.640
in that verse six, that he was tired.


00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.280
So let's read the next three verses.


00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.640
And it says, "A woman of Samaria came to draw water,


00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.440
"and Jesus said, 'Give me a drink,'


00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.480
"because his disciples had gone into town to buy food."


00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.540
And so her response is, "How is it that you, a Jew,


00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.560
"ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?"


00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.720
And she asked him, "For Jews do not associate


00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.840
"with Samaritans."


00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.020
And Jesus answered, "If you knew the gift of God,


00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.160
"and who is saying this to you, give me a drink."


00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.360
And you would ask him, and he would give you living water.


00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.340
So what is happening here?


00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:04.340
So despite being tired, he still saw an opportunity


00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:08.480
to share who he was with her.


00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.720
That's the first thing I want you to see.


00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.640
Despite being tired and worn out from his journey,


00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.960
he still took time to see the one


00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.240
that needed to experience a relationship with Jesus.


00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.680
Number two, one of the things that we see here,


00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.720
and we'll kind of see this in verse nine,


00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.640
is where he is crossing cultural barriers.


00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.560
See, Jews and Samaritans didn't like each other.


00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.360
They didn't like each other at all.


00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.560
And you guys know in a society that we live in,


00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.240
there is a lot of racism, there's a lot of hate


00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.520
across our political lines to just,


00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.900
you look different, you act different, you talk different.


00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.820
We don't like you.


00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.560
There's these issues, and a lot of times


00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.760
we don't cross those barriers


00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.600
because of the differences that we have.


00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.720
Here's what Jesus did.


00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.720
A Jew, who Jews would not be known to talk to Samaritans,


00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.920
didn't care.


00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.720
It was so important that this woman could experience Jesus,


00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.200
that he crossed cultural boundaries, right?


00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.360
And so because he crossed these cultural boundaries,


00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.600
we start seeing her ask questions, right?


00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.880
And she says this, "How is it that you are a Jew


00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.360
"asking me for a drink?


00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.320
"Jews do not associate with Samaritans."


00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.120
Let me just tell you this, practical evangelism


00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.960
is doing things people wouldn't expect you to do.


00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.920
Why?


00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.280
Because then they ask questions.


00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.240
I'm telling you, my favorite way to evangelize


00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.840
is to do something for somebody


00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.360
where they ask me a question,


00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.720
why are you doing this?


00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.560
Why?


00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.760
And I love Jesus.


00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.560
Oh man, this is what he says.


00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.260
He says, if you knew why I did what I did,


00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.480
you wouldn't be saying give me a drink.


00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.400
You would be saying give me a drink of living water.


00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.640
And again, he's kind of setting this up


00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.600
because he doesn't explain what living water is.


00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.400
Living water, I'm just gonna spoil this for you.


00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.440
Living water is a life transformed,


00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.260
a life that would experience hope and forgiveness


00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.580
and salvation, something that she would love to have,


00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.880
but she didn't even know she could have it,


00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.680
because no Jew would ever cross the cultural boundaries


00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.700
to even experience or give that to her


00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.580
to be able to experience.


00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.680
So she asked this question, and guys, I'm just telling you,


00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.740
if you wanna know what practical evangelism is,


00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.940
do things that people wouldn't expect you to do.


00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.360
Be generous.


00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.260
Stop and change somebody's tire.


00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.480
Buy lunch for somebody.


00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.420
Do what we've been doing for the last three years.


00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.760
We've been going into schools, writing encouraging cards,


00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.000
and providing gifts and lunches and meals for teachers.


00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.840
And here's the question that we keep getting asked, why?


00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.500
It's just food, it's just gifts,


00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.520
but to them it means so much.


00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.800
And here's what we get to say,


00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.760
because Jesus so transformed our lives.


00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:57.360
He loved us so much that we could pour out love to you


00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.480
through serving and giving.


00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.500
I love this, right?


00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.200
We're still building the story up.


00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.520
And so really he responds with this again.


00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.320
He knew that she would be interested in living water.


00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.600
So this would get her thinking, right?


00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.960
What does this man have that I don't have, right?


00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.080
So then let's look at verses 11 through 18.


00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.260
Again, I'm walking through this quickly


00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.040
'cause we're just looking at the examples.


00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.120
So he says this, she says this,


00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.760
"Sir," said the woman, "you don't even have a bucket,


00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.920
"and the well is deep.


00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.620
"So where do you get this living water?


00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.540
"You aren't greater than our father Jacob, are you?


00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.800
"He gave us the well to drink from, it's himself,


00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.020
"as did his sons and livestock.


00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.200
"And Jesus said, everyone who drinks from this water


00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.200
"will get thirsty again.


00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.900
"But whoever drinks from the water that I give


00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.920
"will never be thirsty again.


00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.860
"In fact, the water that I give him


00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.700
"will become a well of water springing up in him


00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.320
"for eternal life.


00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.000
"And sir, the woman said to him,


00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.480
"give me the water so that I won't be thirsty


00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.380
and come here to draw water.


00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.680
And he said, go call your husband.


00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.320
And he told her to come back.


00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.720
And she says, I don't have a husband, she answered.


00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.160
And he says, you have correctly said,


00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.280
I don't have a husband, Jesus said.


00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.960
For you have had five husbands,


00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.480
and the man you now have is not your husband.


00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.240
What you have said is true.


00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.440
So I'm gonna break this down


00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.960
and see exactly what Jesus did.


00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.320
And here's, I think there's so many good things in here.


00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.320
I hope we have time to get to all of them.


00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.900
So rather than asking for a drink of the living water,


00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.180
she begins to question his ability to provide it.


00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.340
I'm just gonna be honest with you.


00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.700
When you practically share your faith


00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.540
and you begin to share truth with people


00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.300
about salvation and who Jesus is,


00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.900
they're going to challenge the truth.


00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.000
They're going to challenge whether you can provide


00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.940
the truth of a life change that experiences


00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.540
hope and peace this side of heaven


00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.620
and hope and peace on the other side of heaven.


00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.380
they're going to question it.


00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.220
So she begins to go back to what she does know, right?


00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.260
She begins to explain about the well as Jacob's well


00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.100
and you can't be greater than Jacob, could you?


00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:08.940
Right?


00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.960
And I just kind of give you an example.


00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.900
This would be like us offering a better life, right?


00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.280
Jesus has offered a better life, a better water


00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.900
than the one that she currently had.


00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.020
And so she begins to say how could what he had


00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.600
be better than that, right?


00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.580
So rejecting the better.


00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.860
But Jesus explains this in verses 13 and 14,


00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.420
how the water is greater than what she had.


00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.340
The water that he had would provide her


00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.460
to not thirst anymore.


00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.080
So let me kinda divide this


00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.460
just so we are all on the same page.


00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.320
He's not talking about drinking water anymore.


00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.100
I wanna make sure we're all on the same page here.


00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.460
He has bypassed drinking water


00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.340
because he's saying what I have


00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.980
will allow you to not thirst anymore.


00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.340
Let's just stop and think about this.


00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.780
How many of y'all get hungry at least three times a day?


00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.020
I eat like five times a day.


00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.460
Because we crave food.


00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.580
We crave nourishment.


00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.740
But there's something deeper inside.


00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.860
Do you guys struggle with craving fulfillment in life?


00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.540
Craving peace?


00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.060
Do you crave to be at peace with God,


00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.020
and peace with the things around you, no matter what's going on?


00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.260
Do you crave, even though you may be financially struggling,


00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.740
or your marriage is struggling, or your family is in chaos,


00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.100
do you crave to have peace?


00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.100
See, that's what Jesus was saying.


00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.900
If you receive the living water that I have,


00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:47.460
it will provide peace in the midst of chaos.


00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.260
I just, I promise you this,


00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.860
whether you have faith in Jesus and whether you don't,


00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.860
you will have chaos in your life.


00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.900
But with Jesus comes peace.


00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.980
With Jesus comes this ability to not be thirsty again


00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.780
because you have found the fulfillment


00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.220
of what God's plan of a perfect relationship with him,


00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.180
this side of heaven.


00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.940
But apart from Christ, we will continually thirst


00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.820
and crave and pursue money, pursue position,


00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:19.820
pursue pleasure, and it will always end up wanting more.


00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:24.700
That's what Jesus was saying.


00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.500
And when we share the gospel, we're presenting a gospel


00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.600
that says we can provide something,


00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.900
we can give communication of something, a Jesus,


00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.740
that can fulfill you, that can help you,


00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.940
that can walk alongside you, that can encourage you,


00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.560
that will never leave you nor forsake you


00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.780
like some of your friends have, some of your family has.


00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.580
He will never, I'm telling you guys,


00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.100
that is something I'm so thankful


00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.660
that I've experienced this at Heaven.


00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.680
That when I start thinking about this,


00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.240
There's so many people around us.


00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.600
There may be people in this room,


00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.000
you may be needing this right now.


00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.280
Why do we need to practically share our faith?


00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.200
Because man, people need to experience this living water,


00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.760
and that's what Jesus was sharing.


00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.440
And so what did she say in verse 15?


00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.480
Sir, the woman said, give me the water


00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.880
so I won't get thirsty again.


00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.480
She's thinking naturally thirsty


00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.680
because water was important.


00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.800
She didn't really know what she was asking for.


00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.600
She didn't know what she was really asking for.


00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.560
So Jesus begins to go somewhere where some of us are like,


00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.720
isn't this a little bit touchy, right?


00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.560
Isn't this a little bit touchy?


00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.400
So he begins to call out, you know,


00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.440
hey, have your husband come.


00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.400
She says, I don't have a husband.


00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.460
He says, well, you've had five,


00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.200
and you're not even married right now.


00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.840
And so it's like, oh man, he's judging me again.


00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.240
No, Jesus wasn't actually judging.


00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.700
What he was saying was, everything you've tried


00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.400
to fulfill your life with is not working.


00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.560
He wasn't saying, oh, you sinner, you're going to hell.


00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.560
He wasn't even saying that.


00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.060
Here's what he was saying.


00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.700
What you've experienced in life,


00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.680
you've continued to just thirst after,


00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.500
and it's not satisfying you.


00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.420
Do you realize I'm offering you more than water?


00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.400
I'm offering you peace, a different life


00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.760
that you don't have to keep pursuing those relationships


00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.400
that fail you time after time.


00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.240
That's why Jesus is asking those questions.


00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.840
Not to condemn her, but to free her.


00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.060
I want you to understand this.


00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.560
When we are sharing the gospel,


00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.540
"You are not there judging your friends.


00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.400
"You're there freeing them."


00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:30.780
I don't know if that helps you at all


00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.120
when it comes to when you're thinking


00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.740
about sharing your faith.


00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.300
Does it help you to understand


00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.940
that you're not there judging your friends?


00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.620
You're there seeing your friends


00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.520
that are heading somewhere, destroying their lives,


00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.380
not experiencing what God has for them,


00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.820
God's best for them.


00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.940
You're helping them.


00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.420
And I've said this over and over again


00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.640
in other illustrations in my sermons,


00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.520
but if you knew somebody was gonna walk in front of a car,


00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.880
would you stop them?


00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.960
100% of you, I think, unless you said 99%


00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.900
because you don't like one of your friends,


00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.520
but 100% of you said, "I would grab their arm


00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.320
"and I would say, 'No, there's a car coming.'"


00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.820
Because that's right.


00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.660
You don't want them to be destroyed.


00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:17.640
When we share the gospel, when we share who Jesus is,


00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.160
We are grabbing them by the arm and we're saying,


00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.780
there's a car coming, you're going to get hit.


00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.840
We're not there laughing and judging them


00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.040
for them even being stupid enough


00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.980
to walk in front of the car, 'cause here's the thing,


00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.920
we were walking in front of the car once too,


00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.440
and somebody grabbed us and pulled us back.


00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.080
I'm so thankful for that person.


00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:45.320
My friend was Scott, my buddy from college was Scott.


00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.280
I'll remember him this day and forevermore.


00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.840
And I go back to Scott and many times I'll text him


00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.600
or call him and I'll say, "Hey Scott,


00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.540
"thank you so much for inviting me to church.


00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.620
"Thank you so much for being a friend with me


00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.260
"when I probably wasn't a godly person at all.


00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:04.160
"Thank you so much for laboring alongside me for two years."


00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.840
I tell my wife that, she's in the room now


00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.080
as she goes back to kids.


00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.680
I thank my wife for laboring with me when I was lost


00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.660
because it was hard to live with me, okay?


00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.140
So I think about this instance,


00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.340
Jesus is really just sharing a better way.


00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.780
When we think about this,


00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.180
and I wanna continue to share what sin is,


00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.380
sin is not God's best for your life.


00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:28.220
I say this, if I could offer you,


00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.580
if Jesus could offer you a better way to live,


00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.780
to experience God's best for you, would you want it?


00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.660
Many of us would say, absolutely.


00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.140
That's what Jesus says when he says,


00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.380
"Repent of your sins."


00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.820
Repent of not God's best for you


00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.360
and accept God's best for you,


00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.960
which is eternal life, a relationship with Jesus.


00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.300
That's exactly what Jesus is beginning to share here


00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.620
with this woman.


00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.880
So now we go in verses 19 through 26,


00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.260
and I'm gonna summarize this one a little bit quicker


00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.520
because he kinda goes deep,


00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.960
and we don't have time to go deep,


00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.040
but he really begins to relate with this woman,


00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.000
and he says this, in verse 19, she says,


00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.240
"Sir," the woman replied, "I see that you're a prophet.


00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.860
"Our fathers worshipped on this mountain,


00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.280
"but you Jews say that the place to worship is Jerusalem.


00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.260
"And Jesus told her, 'Believe me, woman,


00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.860
"An hour is coming when you will worship the Father


00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.920
"neither on this mountain nor on Jerusalem.


00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.580
"You Samaritans worship what you do not know,


00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.220
"and we worship what we do know,


00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.020
"because salvation is from the Jews.


00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.620
"But an hour is coming and is now here


00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.020
"when the true worshipers will worship the Father


00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.260
"in spirit and in truth.


00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.160
"Yes, the Father wants such people to worship Him.


00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.100
"God is spirit, and those who worship Him


00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.400
"must worship in spirit and truth."


00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.960
And here's what the woman said.


00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.960
"I know that the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ.


00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.460
"When he comes, he'll explain all this to me."


00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.580
I just wanna stop right there, because again,


00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.900
I'm not diving in to the theology behind this,


00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.100
'cause you're like, "What is going on here?"


00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.700
Even she was kinda getting a little bit lost


00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.220
in what Jesus was saying.


00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.740
And so here's what she said.


00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.620
"I know the Messiah is coming to explain all this


00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.820
"a little bit better and to help me understand this."


00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.520
And here's what Jesus says.


00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.340
"I, the one speaking to you, am he."


00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:13.340
So again, as we look at this,


00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.700
this is a deeper spiritual conversation


00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.640
he's having with this woman,


00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.300
but at the end, she summarizes this by saying


00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.820
she knows there's a Savior coming.


00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.860
She knows she needs something greater.


00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.260
She recognizes her need for God.


00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.620
So many people get caught up in that part


00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.660
where they don't recognize it.


00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.860
She came to that conclusion in this conversation,


00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.380
and Jesus finally presents the truth to her.


00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.920
He is the one she's been waiting on.


00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.280
He basically shares the good news of who he is.


00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.960
And so then after she meets Jesus,


00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.240
this is the beautiful picture, right?


00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.360
We're gonna skip a couple of verses


00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.920
because his disciples come back,


00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.920
they bring him food and he doesn't want the food


00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.320
because he doesn't need physical food,


00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.440
he needs spiritual food,


00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.460
but we're gonna look at verses 28 and 29.


00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.400
How does she respond after Jesus says,


00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.640
"I'm the one that you've been looking for?"


00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.720
She responds with this in verse 28.


00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.880
Then the woman left her jar, think about this,


00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.960
Her role was to walk all the way to go get water


00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.040
and bring it back for their family.


00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.300
Water was important.


00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.600
She would go on a long journey to do this.


00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.420
She left everything she was doing.


00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.920
She didn't care about natural water anymore.


00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.440
So she left her jar.


00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.280
Let me go back 28, sorry.


00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.520
Left her jar, went into town and told the people,


00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.760
"Come see a man who told me everything I ever did.


00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.700
"Could this be the Messiah?"


00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.540
and they left their town and made their way to him.


00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.480
So once she heard the gospel, she immediately left.


00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.020
This is this beautiful picture


00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:43.660
that now we're gonna move from Jesus.


00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.280
So we literally just walked through


00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.020
how Jesus practically shared who he was.


00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.980
Now some of you, I wanna be as clear as I can


00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.700
because some of you do what I do.


00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.780
We read the Bible, we see Jesus do something,


00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.100
and we say we'll never be like Jesus.


00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.580
Anybody do that?


00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.800
Jesus is the son of God.


00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.460
We're never gonna meet his standards.


00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.660
Here's the cool part.


00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.340
I really want you to see this.


00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.460
If you have given your life to Jesus,


00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.020
Jesus lives inside you.


00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.760
Jesus guides you.


00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.160
So when you share your faith,


00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:21.160
Jesus is helping you share who he is through you.


00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.780
Like, connect those pieces.


00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.140
Jesus is with you.


00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.940
So when we look at Jesus' example,


00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:29.680
he practically shared who he was.


00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.540
In the context, in the setting where he was,


00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.080
no matter how tired he was, he shared who he was,


00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.300
and he kept walking through the needs


00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.500
and conversating with her until she came to the conclusion


00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.340
that this may be the Messiah.


00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.940
So now we're gonna just switch and start looking


00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.720
at how this woman responded, right?


00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.100
How this woman responded to knowing that the Messiah come.


00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.220
She left everything she knew,


00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.700
she went and found people that she knew,


00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.600
and she told 'em all, could this be the Messiah?


00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.360
Could this be what we've been looking for?


00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.620
And how did those people respond?


00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:01.320
Here's the cool part in verse 30.


00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.280
They left town and made their way to him.


00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.620
Do you think those people that she went and found


00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.340
was in the middle of their work day,


00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.840
middle of making dinner, whatever it was,


00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.740
'cause we don't know the time of the day.


00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.480
You think they were busy?


00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.780
We talk about we're busy all the time.


00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.000
We talk about we're exhausted.


00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.340
Jesus was exhausted.


00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:21.100
They left everything to possibly experience who Jesus was.


00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.040
I love that.


00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.000
And so these disciples, again,


00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.120
were worried about Jesus eating.


00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.240
This is verses 31 through 33.


00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.800
But as we jump back into 34,


00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.440
This is what Jesus tells his disciples.


00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.100
My food is to do the will of him, speaking of God,


00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.000
who sent me in to finish his work.


00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.540
And Jesus told him, don't say there's still four months


00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.160
and then comes the harvest.


00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.540
Listen to what I'm telling you.


00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.240
Open your eyes and look.


00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.220
The fields, because they are ready for harvest.


00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.380
The reaper is already receiving his pay


00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.380
and gathering fruit for eternal life.


00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.860
So the sower and reaper can rejoice together.


00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.380
For in this case, the saying is true.


00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.320
One sows and another reaps.


00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.240
I sent you to reap but you didn't labor


00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.680
and the others have labored


00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.060
and you have benefited from their labor.


00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.780
Let me just translate quickly


00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.360
what Jesus is telling his disciples


00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.720
and so we now bring in this third group.


00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.480
A group of men that had been following Jesus


00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.880
were struggling to share their faith as well.


00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.040
They were struggling to realize


00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.960
that there was people out there that need Jesus


00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.320
and Jesus is sitting here saying,


00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.560
you guys are getting distracted


00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.960
with your personal relationships with me


00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.480
and you're not putting a priority on the harvest


00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.400
which is already out there.


00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.480
And he's telling his disciples,


00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.720
"The harvest is plentiful, go."


00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.620
They're ready, go.


00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.360
Even Jesus was talking to people


00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.680
who would claim to be followers of him


00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.200
and challenging them to go share their faith.


00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.040
They struggled.


00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.180
So you know we can all relate with the disciples as well.


00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.820
So that's just a secondary group.


00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.320
So now we see how the Samaritans responded


00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.120
that she shared with in verses 39 through 30.


00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.760
We're almost done.


00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.500
So he says this, "Now many Samaritans from the town


00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.700
"believed in him," speaking of Jesus,


00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.080
"because of what the woman had said."


00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.680
I wanna stop right there, how beautiful this is.


00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.940
Jesus shares with the woman.


00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:14.900
She leaves immediately her job, everything she's been doing,


00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.880
she goes and says, "Come see Jesus."


00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.020
And many of these people came to faith in Christ


00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:23.000
because of her willingness to leave what she was doing


00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.640
and to go tell others.


00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.240
I'll just tell you, I've been on the other side


00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.960
of that before, where I've got the opportunity


00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.040
to share faith with other people


00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.720
and seeing other people come to faith in Christ.


00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.480
And it's glorious, because I don't care


00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.120
what I was doing before, like it don't matter.


00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.720
Like it'll take care of itself.


00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.680
To see people come to faith in Christ,


00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.160
it's a beautiful thing.


00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.720
And then he goes on from there and he says,


00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.960
he told them every, he had told me everything I ever did.


00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.120
And so when the Sabaritans came to him,


00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.560
they asked him to stay with them and stayed there two days.


00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.020
And many more believed because of what he had said.


00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.220
and they told the woman,


00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.180
we no longer believe because of what you have said,


00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.860
since we have hurt ourselves,


00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.780
and know this is really the Savior of the world.


00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.560
These people came to hear about Jesus,


00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.980
and they spent time with Jesus,


00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.300
and as they spent time with Jesus,


00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.580
they didn't just depend upon the woman's testimony,


00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.940
they had their own testimony,


00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.740
and they gave their lives to Christ.


00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:17.660
I think one of the coolest things is we see Jesus


00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:20.780
in this very kind of difficult conversation with a woman,


00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.900
and it was a little bit longer conversation,


00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.220
but it took the faith of one woman


00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.740
to go tell a couple of people,


00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.340
and it transformed their lives.


00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:34.140
You never know who you're sharing your faith with


00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.100
that down the line will touch somebody else's life


00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.740
that will transform many lives.


00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:38.860
You always go back to the statement,


00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.420
I still don't even remember the guy's name.


00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.040
Nobody ever knows the guy's name


00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.580
that led Billy Graham to faith in Christ,


00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.780
but everybody knows who Billy Graham is.


00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:49.300
You never know who you're going to share your faith with,


00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.260
and it transformed lives after lives


00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.620
after lives for many years.


00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.140
And I think back to my friend Scott.


00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.260
My friend Scott, when he invited me to church


00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.720
and when he sat with me and labored with me


00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.340
during my difficulty of not knowing Jesus


00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.900
and complaining about a lot of things,


00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.780
he didn't know one day I would come to Hamilton


00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.820
from Oklahoma and plan a church.


00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.020
And this is not about me, y'all.


00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.580
This is about Jesus, because Jesus transforms lives.


00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.620
Jesus transforms lives.


00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.780
So what is, we learned today,


00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.100
and I'm gonna kinda summarize this.


00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.240
Jesus is our greatest example of how to engage someone


00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.900
with the gospel.


00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:27.240
And even he had to spend time consistently with his father.


00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.020
See, Jesus was able to share his faith


00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.120
because of his power from God.


00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.980
He needed God to even encourage him


00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.120
and to remind him of his calling.


00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.020
And this is daily why for us, we need to know Jesus.


00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.140
If you've given your life to Jesus,


00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.460
to spend time with Jesus so that Jesus transforms your life


00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.020
and that you go out and become the light of Christ.


00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.920
And we even see this, that a woman with a tattered past


00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.220
can share her faith and be honest about


00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.780
what she's walked through and lead people


00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.000
to faith in Christ.


00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.600
Your background, your past does not define you.


00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.920
I'm just telling you this again.


00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.740
Your past does not define you.


00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.280
Somebody needed to hear that today.


00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.540
'Cause Jesus didn't judge her.


00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:15.400
Jesus shared truth with her and gave her the living water.


00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.800
I love that picture.


00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.860
That's what we're called to do as followers of Jesus.


00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.140
And I love what the woman did.


00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.520
It wasn't the special words the woman did.


00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.820
So when you say, I can screw this up,


00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.820
if I share my faith, I might mess it up.


00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.620
That woman wasn't worried about it.


00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:34.140
She just shared what she knew, and it transforms lives.


00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.840
It was her simple obedience that transformed lives.


00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:41.460
So I would just say this as we close today.


00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:46.420
I used to struggle with sharing my faith.


00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:49.220
And finally, God got ahold of me to this point,


00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.780
'Cause I was worried too much about the technique


00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.320
and less about the message.


00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.200
And I had to start reflecting,


00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.520
if Jesus has transformed my life so much, if he has,


00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.840
and then I had to really reflect, and he has,


00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.960
then that is enough to convince me


00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.920
to go share my faith with my friends,


00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.880
and even those that are not my friends.


00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.480
And so I wanna give you an example


00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.040
that today I've gotten better and better


00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.520
about sharing my faith.


00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.480
And it's not just because I have to 'cause I'm a pastor,


00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.600
It's because I truly believe that God has called


00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.960
every one of us to share our faith.


00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.280
I went to, everybody's gonna love this,


00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.640
I went to Flubb's on Friday.


00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.440
Everybody loves Flubb's.


00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.920
So we had a volunteer banquet last night


00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.480
and we bought Flubb's gift cards for all of our volunteers.


00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.560
And I'm going up there and there's this older couple


00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.400
that's getting ready to go up to the window


00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.600
and order some ice cream.


00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.600
And so I'm kinda standing back.


00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.160
Well, they decided they weren't ready yet.


00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.920
And so I step up and say, hey, I need this many gift cards.


00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.680
And they're like, okay, great.


00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.400
So we'll get those gift cards ready for you.


00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.320
And then I step back.


00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.680
And so there's this moment,


00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.580
and you guys know you have these moments in your life.


00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.960
There's this moment where I can pull out my phone


00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.520
because this is what we do when it's awkward


00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.920
and there's somebody standing around you.


00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.300
And I'm just gonna search social media


00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.300
because that's the comfortable thing.


00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.720
Or I can put down the phone


00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.060
and I can engage this couple with the gospel.


00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.720
And I just said, "Hey, y'all like Flubs?"


00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.760
It's a stupid question 'cause they're at Flubs.


00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.600
(audience laughing)


00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.880
Even I say stupid stuff.


00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.660
"Yeah, yeah, our daughter works here."


00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.640
I'm like, "She does?"


00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.800
"Yeah, and so come to figure out the lady


00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.840
that we always worked with, worked here for 26 years.


00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.940
It's great.


00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.860
Well, that's awesome.


00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.040
So I started connecting with them,


00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.800
and they're like, well, what are you doing?


00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.000
I'm like, well, I'm getting all these gift cards.


00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:24.840
Well, what for?


00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.800
And so I started telling them about our church


00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.560
and what we do and why we're here.


00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.320
And I just began to share who we are.


00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.800
And really what it was, it was the overflow of my life.


00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.360
That's what I shared, the overflow of my life with Jesus.


00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.360
And they're like, that is awesome.


00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.600
And you know what the older lady said


00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.280
within five minutes of getting to know her?


00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.840
"Can I give you a hug?"


00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.740
So I hugged this old lady.


00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.120
I'm like, okay, let's hug.


00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.620
"Great, this is great."


00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.980
Come to figure out, they go to church,


00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.860
and a church they've been at for like 46 years,


00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.740
and they're just so thankful


00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.580
that there's a church in this community


00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.220
that is investing in this community


00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.900
and loves on their volunteers,


00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:01.260
and meets in the YMCA, and they were just super pumped.


00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.060
And they bought my ice cream, not the gift cards,


00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:03.900
but they bought my ice cream,


00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.640
'cause I had to get an ice cream 'cause of my flubs.


00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.520
They bought my ice cream, they said,


00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.460
"No, we're not letting you pay for your ice cream,


00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.540
"because we love what you do."


00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.260
See, I didn't know if they knew Jesus or not,


00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.280
But I knew for me that I'm in a moment,


00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.820
and these moments happen, guys,


00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.120
more often than you know in your life,


00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.520
that if we'll just realize it,


00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.640
that we may get the opportunity to transform lives.


00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.500
And that's one that didn't transform a life.


00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:31.080
It got an opportunity to just really encourage one another.


00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.540
But there's been moments where I've been in a Walmart


00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.060
and there's one person in the aisle


00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.300
and I'm just like, I don't wanna talk to them.


00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.140
But then I just started saying,


00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.780
"Hey, do you think those peas are any good?"


00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.780
and they're like, I don't know, I've never tried 'em.


00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.300
And you start a random conversation


00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.880
and you get to share your faith,


00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.300
or you get to say, hey, how can I pray for you?


00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.980
Right, you start conversations.


00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.800
I'm just telling you, we can practically evangelize,


00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.180
not because we feel guilty


00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:00.260
and we don't have to use all the sophisticated words.


00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.580
We just have to genuinely care.


00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.540
We just have to genuinely care for people.


00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:10.180
So my challenge for you today is number one,


00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:12.600
if you have given your life to Christ.


00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.120
We're gonna have a time of invitation tonight.


00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.100
Here's the point I want.


00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:19.300
Invitation is an opportunity to ask God,


00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.700
okay, I've heard something today.


00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.340
I've heard the message today.


00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.780
How should I respond?


00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:24.780
So here's my challenge for you.


00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.000
If you've given your life to Christ,


00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.660
is to ask God to help you overcome


00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:33.520
whatever fear that you have to share in your faith.


00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.660
Whatever fear you have to inviting people to church,


00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.060
ask God to remove it,


00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:38.020
because that's the number one thing.


00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.500
you recognize it and then you ask God to remove it.


00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.740
Number two, when you get done asking God that,


00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.820
I want you to ask God to put three people


00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:50.220
on your mind and heart that you know you do life with


00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.220
that doesn't go to church, doesn't know Jesus,


00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.220
maybe it's a family member, maybe it's a friend,


00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.580
I don't care, somebody, and you begin to pray


00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.620
that God gives you an opportunity to just start


00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:03.180
a conversation about what God's doing in your life.


00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.780
But here's what I will promise you,


00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.100
and I'm gonna go back to Jesus.


00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.420
Jesus spent many times with his Father,


00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.260
and when he would come out of that time with his Father,


00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.660
he would go and do ministry.


00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:16.660
You will never share your faith


00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.460
the way that God has called you to share your faith


00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.520
if you don't spend time with Jesus.


00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.180
If you don't get into his word,


00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.740
if you don't come to an Inspire Group


00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.660
and get involved in community throughout the week,


00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.180
and I'll talk more about what Inspire Groups are,


00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:31.620
but if you don't know Jesus on a consistent basis,


00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.060
you won't go share your faith.


00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.700
It's not gonna even be on your mind.


00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.320
So it starts with a relationship with Jesus.


00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.520
And so I want those that have a relationship with Jesus


00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.840
to ask that question during invitation to the Lord


00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.560
and respond in faith.


00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.440
But there's a second group of people


00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.580
that I wanna talk about.


00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.320
You're in this room and you're sitting here saying,


00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.400
what the heck are you talking about, right?


00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.640
You're challenging us to share our faith


00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.480
and I don't even have a faith.


00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.040
And I don't know everybody's faith in here.


00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.240
I haven't had personal spiritual conversations


00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.160
with every person in this room.


00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.960
But I know you know.


00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.080
You and the Lord knows where your heart is


00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.340
and whether you've given your life to Jesus.


00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:09.040
Let me just tell you this, from the words of Jesus,


00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.940
there is living water that will so transform your life


00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:15.600
that if you've never given your life to Jesus,


00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.680
if you've never said, Lord, I need you,


00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.860
I repent of my sins, I understand that I'm falling short


00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.980
in my life, I've not experienced God's best,


00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.300
I want to experience God's best,


00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.380
that may be you today, and if it is you today,


00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.980
you can give your life to Jesus.


00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.340
It's simple faith.


00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.540
Did you see this with this woman?


00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:37.580
Did this woman pray the right prayer to get saved?


00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.920
No, she believed.


00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.420
She believed.


00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.500
And so today, if you have not given your life to Jesus,


00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.840
you can repent of your sins and believe in Jesus.


00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.160
And you can begin to experience God's best for your life.


00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.620
And it is a process, not in salvation,


00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:54.540
salvation's immediately,


00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.580
it's a process in experiencing Jesus.


00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.020
And here's my promise to you.


00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:03.020
We are a church that exists to inspire hope


00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.440
by helping you, by helping you.


00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.380
You, you, you, and all you, and you are helping me


00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:12.320
discover a relationship with Jesus.


00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:17.620
We do that together, we link arms together.


00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.480
So I'm here for you.


00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.960
So if you wanna give your lives to Jesus today,


00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.500
you can do that through simply just saying,


00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:27.500
Lord, I need you, give me new life, and I surrender to you.


00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:28.880
So during this time of invitation,


00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.440
I pray that you do that if you haven't


00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.960
given your life to Jesus.


00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.760
And here's the thing, I'm gonna be standing in the back


00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.600
'cause I love to stand in the back


00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.680
'cause nobody wants to come in the front.


00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.680
If you have questions about how to follow Jesus


00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.920
or you need prayer, please come talk to me.


00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.760
I want to pray with you, I want to encourage you.


00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.720
But during this time of invitation, seek the Lord, guys.


00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.840
There is someone, and I say this way too much


00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.840
and you guys that have been around this church too long


00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.400
probably get so annoyed by me,


00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.120
but I will say this until I'm blue in the face.


00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.520
There is somebody waiting for you


00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.640
on the other side of your obedience to share your faith,


00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.200
to invite them to church.


00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.320
I was waiting on my friend Scott.


00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.520
What if he didn't invite me?


00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.240
Where would I be today?


00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.040
I'm so thankful for my friend Scott.


00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:16.920
But there's somebody that's waiting on you.


00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.420
Don't leave them waiting.


00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.880
I'm so thankful Jesus didn't say I'm too tired


00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.400
and left that woman waiting to hear who Jesus was.


00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.440
And I'm so thankful that woman didn't get too caught up


00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.680
in getting water to bring back to her family,


00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.080
that she ran back to tell people who Jesus was,


00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.960
because they were waiting on her obedience.


00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.780
Oh man, I can't wait to be a part of seeing what God does


00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.960
through this church and taking one simple step


00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.800
of practically sharing your faith with those around you.


00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.640
Let's pray.


00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.000
Lord Jesus, we love you.


00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.520
God, we are so thankful for you.


00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.700
We're so thankful for your example in the word today.


00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.300
Lord, I know that we just skimmed over this message.


00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:58.900
But Lord, I look at your example


00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:03.300
as a tired and exhausted human experience,


00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.900
and you still shared your faith.


00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.200
You shared who you were.


00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.300
And Lord, you kept showing love to this woman,


00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.260
and you kept reminding her of her need of the living water.


00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:17.940
And once, finally once, Lord, she says that she wants it.


00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.020
and she leaves all that she has to go tell others about it.


00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.300
Lord, may we be transformed by their example,


00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:27.220
by your example, Jesus, by the woman's example,


00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:30.780
Lord, that we will just take the message of the gospel


00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.840
and Lord, ask you to help us share it with those around us.


00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.900
Lord, I'm praying for salvations in this room today


00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.720
for those who haven't given their lives to you.


00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.980
Lord, I'm praying for salvations in classrooms,


00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.700
I'm praying for them in workplaces,


00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.060
I'm praying for them in neighborhoods,


00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.140
from everybody in this room that's going to go out


00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.060
and share their faith.


00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:53.180
Lord, I'm praying for more people to come back next week


00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.100
because of invites this week.


00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.400
Lord, work through us like you've never worked before


00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.100
as a church and as an individual.


00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:04.700
Lord, and remind us what you've done for us.


00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:08.020
God, you have sent your son Jesus to this earth


00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:10.340
because we needed you.


00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:13.740
And God, you did not withhold your son


00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:16.100
to meet the need that we had to be saved.


00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:22.700
Thank you. May that drive us into this week, into this life ahead, Lord, to help


00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:28.280
others experience hope in you. So we pray all this in your heavenly name. Amen.


00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:33.120
So take some time to seek the Lord.
