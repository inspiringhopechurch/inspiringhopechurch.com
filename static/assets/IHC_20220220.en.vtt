00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.100
Paul is going to teach us that today
that our top priority should be prayer.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.710
And I started thinking through this, um,
it's not because we have to, it's not

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.750
because that's what we're supposed to do,
but prayer as we'll learn today is one of

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.480
the most valuable resources in our lives.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.880
And so as you get to know me a little
bit more, as I look at things from an

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.350
objective view and this idea behind.

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:29.174
How many in this room has
been told you should pray.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:29.924
Let's start there.

00:00:29.924 --> 00:00:32.025
How many in this room has been
told you should pray in life.

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:32.775
Right?

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:35.595
We get told all the time what we
should do, but if you're anything

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:38.925
like me, we either one don't like
people telling us what we should do.

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:44.595
Or number two, we get told to do something
that we don't really fully understand how.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.560
And so today I really want to
walk through what is prayer?

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.760
How do we pray?

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.630
Why do we pray?

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.530
Who do we pray for?

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.800
I want to walk through the basics
because what I would love to do is for

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.940
all of us to start on the same page
and build a foundation so that at the

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.440
end of this, we can walk out of here.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.250
One, knowing those things, knowing
what prayer is, how to pray, who

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.520
to pray for, what, what is our
posture supposed to be in prayer?

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.290
And why, why does that even matter?

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.450
By the time we walk out of here,
you'll sit there and go, you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.820
know, Somebody telling me that
I should prioritize prayer.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.929
And now I understand why, rather than
somebody telling me I need to prioritize

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.490
prior, but I have no clue why I don't
even know how good luck for somebody else.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.320
And that's what I'm excited about today.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.600
And I'll just tell you this in regards
to prayer, I believe prayer is powerful.

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.950
I've said this over and over
again, that I am the result of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.330
someone else's answered prayer.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.800
100% have heard people tell me before, Hey
Ben, I had prayed for you when you were.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.539
And I look at my life now and I
go, I am the person I am today

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.960
because someone prayed for me
and believe that prayer mattered.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.110
And so I started thinking through
this, what have you prayed for that?

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.640
Somebody would say, oh man, I
am an answer to your prayer.

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:01.380
Let me say this today.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.600
So today we're going to be having
some baptisms, Lauren and Brian

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.500
are gonna be baptized today.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.509
And, and, and one of the coolest things.

00:02:07.964 --> 00:02:12.644
As I believe that Brian and Lauren are
an answer to mind Bernie sprayer, right?

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:15.515
We're one of, probably many that
have prayed for you guys, right.

00:02:15.515 --> 00:02:16.484
And not the single yacht.

00:02:16.484 --> 00:02:19.245
And you guys are probably getting
red faced right now, but that's just

00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:23.234
an example of, of what I'm saying is
many times we really look at this,

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:27.015
like prayer makes a difference.

00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:28.274
Prayer is powerful.

00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:31.454
When you begin to think about
all that goes into how God works.

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:37.315
And so if you ever wonder, does my prayers
make it past the ceiling one or percent?

00:02:37.435 --> 00:02:38.095
Absolutely.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:39.835
And it's powerful.

00:02:40.435 --> 00:02:42.745
So these last few weeks, I want to kind
of catch you up these last few weeks.

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:45.775
We walked through the
chapter one of first Timothy.

00:02:46.195 --> 00:02:49.225
Um, and so a couple of things that Paul
taught us that he was trying to teach

00:02:49.255 --> 00:02:51.445
Timothy, um, was, was three things.

00:02:51.445 --> 00:02:53.485
One, he, he taught Timothy to teach the.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.020
He taught Timothy that there
was power in his testimony.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.740
And then he taught Timothy that
there was power in his calling.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.420
And those are the three
things that we talked about.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.450
And so in light of the instruction,
and this is the instruction

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.120
that Paul gave Timothy, the
instruction that Paul gave us.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.510
He's, he's basically saying in light
of these things, I'm gonna kind of

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.660
break them out a little bit more in
light of challenging us and challenging

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.110
Timothy to address false teaching
by teaching the truth, to share our

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.120
testimony because T power testimonies
are powerful to remember your calling.

00:03:23.985 --> 00:03:26.325
We don't want to ship wreck our faith
because of all of this instruction that

00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:30.375
Paul gave Timothy, because of all of this
instruction that Paul's giving us, he says

00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:32.505
this, I urge you to prioritize prayer.

00:03:33.975 --> 00:03:37.515
Paul says that priorities in
prayer is the most important thing.

00:03:37.515 --> 00:03:40.005
And I start thinking through this,
Paul could have said anything in

00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:41.775
this text, we're getting ready to
read it because you're not there

00:03:41.775 --> 00:03:42.905
yet, but we're going to return to it.

00:03:42.945 --> 00:03:44.265
Paul could have prior to his anything.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.695
And he says, no, first of all, pray.

00:03:47.325 --> 00:03:51.975
So my hope is that by the end of today
that we'll see the value, the important.

00:03:57.505 --> 00:03:58.435
I read this scripture.

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:02.245
Um, if by the time they get it up here,
if you don't have it again, it's first

00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:05.365
Timothy chapter two verses one and two.

00:04:05.695 --> 00:04:08.245
This is what it says in that text.

00:04:08.245 --> 00:04:10.795
It says, first of all, and this
is Paul speaking to Timothy.

00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:17.245
First of all, then I urge that
petitions, prayers, intercessions,

00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:19.925
and Thanksgivings being made for.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.420
For the Kings and all those who
are in authority so that we may

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.440
lead a tranquil and quiet life
in all godliness and dignity.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.360
This is good.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.460
And it pleases God, our savior who
wants everyone to be saved and come to

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.750
the knowledge of the truth for there
is one God and one mediator between God

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.360
and humanity, the man Christ Jesus who
gave himself as a ransom for all, as a

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.010
testimony at the proper time for this,
I was appointed a Herald and an apostle.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.930
And I'm telling you the truth.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.890
I am not lying.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.020
And a teacher of the Gentiles.

00:04:56.354 --> 00:04:57.135
And in truth.

00:04:57.854 --> 00:04:59.864
So today we're only going
to cover two verses.

00:05:00.434 --> 00:05:04.364
So this is going to be part one
of why we should, or why we should

00:05:04.364 --> 00:05:06.585
desire to prioritize prayer.

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:11.424
As we begin to look at this text, we
see this pop off the chart and I'll,

00:05:11.424 --> 00:05:12.645
I'll tell you what I used to do.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:17.534
So when I was a new believer, I was
given a Bible and I read through it and

00:05:17.534 --> 00:05:19.635
I wouldn't mark anything in the Bible.

00:05:19.635 --> 00:05:20.924
I just thought it was wrong.

00:05:20.955 --> 00:05:22.034
Like, you don't do that.

00:05:22.034 --> 00:05:22.275
Right.

00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:22.835
You don't do that.

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:24.914
So it took me about four
or five years to realize.

00:05:25.614 --> 00:05:26.544
Hey, I can do that.

00:05:26.544 --> 00:05:27.145
It's not bad.

00:05:27.354 --> 00:05:29.604
So then I started marketing
my Bible, just things that may

00:05:29.664 --> 00:05:30.895
stuck out to me made sense.

00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:35.695
And I remember underlining this and
my Bible and it was this first of all,

00:05:36.325 --> 00:05:42.625
and it stuck out to me, uh, how this
is so important for us to listen in.

00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:48.744
And so I want to ask this question,
have you ever asked God to bless

00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:50.455
your decisions, a decision you made?

00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:51.684
So, Hey God, I made the decision.

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:52.405
Will you bless it?

00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:53.515
Anybody ever done that before?

00:05:55.005 --> 00:05:55.185
Okay.

00:05:55.185 --> 00:05:56.594
Maybe I'm the only one that does that.

00:05:56.655 --> 00:05:58.784
I'm the only one that moves
before I ever asked God.

00:05:58.815 --> 00:06:03.195
So that, that could happen for, for most
of us is where we go and we do life.

00:06:03.195 --> 00:06:06.284
And then at the end, we're like,
Hey, will you just make this work?

00:06:06.675 --> 00:06:07.034
Right.

00:06:07.395 --> 00:06:08.354
And here's the thing.

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:11.924
If we didn't pray before, it's
good that you prayed after.

00:06:12.195 --> 00:06:15.885
But what I would say is what Paul's
challenging us is that first of all,

00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:18.164
before we do anything, we should pray.

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:22.395
So before we make the decision,
before we do the action, before

00:06:22.395 --> 00:06:23.565
we start our day, we should.

00:06:24.765 --> 00:06:27.255
Y cause there's a, there's a word to
learn a little bit more about that.

00:06:27.255 --> 00:06:31.844
It's because it brings about
God's wisdom and direction or

00:06:31.855 --> 00:06:34.245
life rather than our own in this.

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:39.105
And so as, as Paul, sir, first
statement here, signifies this

00:06:39.105 --> 00:06:40.185
again, before you do anything.

00:06:40.185 --> 00:06:42.885
And again, he's, he's talking to
Timothy based upon the instruction

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:43.784
that he had given him, right?

00:06:43.784 --> 00:06:46.425
To address the false teachers,
to appoint leaders, to share

00:06:46.425 --> 00:06:48.195
his powerful press a testimony.

00:06:48.465 --> 00:06:49.905
He says, you need to,
you need to pray for.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.560
So I know you're probably a lot
like me in this idea of may my mind

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.280
from the moment I wake up is running
on all the things I need to do.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.090
And it seems like I'll run all day
and I get to the end of my day and

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.099
I go, man, did I even ask God if
this is what I should be doing?

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:11.710
And so Paul's even
reminding me in this, right?

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.440
So we can catch ourselves
not prioritizing prayer.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.130
And so we either pray one out of.

00:07:19.035 --> 00:07:22.365
The, the idea that this is what
we should do, or we pray sometimes

00:07:22.365 --> 00:07:24.855
if you're anything like us,
it's kind of funny in our house.

00:07:25.305 --> 00:07:30.615
We typically pray for two meals a day,
not three, two, and it's usually lunch

00:07:30.615 --> 00:07:32.985
if the kids remember, because I'm
not eating lunch with them or dinner.

00:07:33.285 --> 00:07:35.235
So it's like some how
breakfast doesn't matter.

00:07:35.235 --> 00:07:38.235
And for some of you, it's probably
because you don't eat it, but so we

00:07:38.235 --> 00:07:39.735
either pray out of rituals as well.

00:07:39.735 --> 00:07:39.975
Right.

00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:45.405
And so we don't pray out of that, that
desire that, that we, we get from God.

00:07:45.945 --> 00:07:48.135
And so I, I really wanted to make
this statement in the middle of the.

00:07:48.975 --> 00:07:52.665
Is that we really desire as a
church to lead a church that

00:07:52.665 --> 00:07:56.805
removes the burden of these two
words, the half to, and the should.

00:07:57.285 --> 00:07:58.335
I've heard Amanda say this over.

00:07:58.335 --> 00:07:59.565
We should ourselves to death.

00:07:59.805 --> 00:08:01.575
That sounds really bad, but we do.

00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:05.085
And that really, I should have
probably said this slower.

00:08:05.865 --> 00:08:06.315
Whew.

00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:12.975
Um, but the whole idea is we
put these burdens on ourselves.

00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:13.185
We will.

00:08:14.145 --> 00:08:15.405
And we do free to pray, right?

00:08:15.405 --> 00:08:16.335
It's middle of the day.

00:08:16.695 --> 00:08:20.115
And we begin to beat ourselves
up because we should have prayed.

00:08:20.355 --> 00:08:21.585
We should have done this.

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:26.594
And I believe that that we need to remove
that burden because that's what Christ

00:08:26.594 --> 00:08:29.715
came to do was move the burden and,
and change it from this for a second.

00:08:29.745 --> 00:08:33.164
I get to, so if we missed it,
you stopped in rather than

00:08:33.164 --> 00:08:34.275
looking for the perfect moment.

00:08:34.365 --> 00:08:35.115
We just do it then.

00:08:35.655 --> 00:08:39.585
And that's what I really want us to
be challenged in, in this, because

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:41.985
I think this, I think too many
Christians miss out on the joy of.

00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:46.515
I think too many Christians miss out on
the joy of going to church and spending

00:08:46.515 --> 00:08:50.925
time with Jesus, through his word and
serving others because they spend more

00:08:50.925 --> 00:08:53.745
of their time with the burden that they
should do these things rather than the

00:08:53.745 --> 00:08:56.444
desire and the opportunity to do them.

00:08:57.765 --> 00:09:02.474
And I say all this to say, this is
when I think back through my life,

00:09:03.405 --> 00:09:07.094
I've caught myself doing things
out of that's what I should do.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.439
And it was not the right heart.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.490
And so when we look at this prioritizing
prayer, please don't take it as a burden.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.319
Take it as, as almost like something
valuable for us, because God has

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.370
chose us to have that relationship
with him and to choose prayer first.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.569
So when we look at this,
I want us to see here.

00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:28.610
Paul says that we should
first start with prayer.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.180
And so just because I want, I
want you to see this statement

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.980
just because we know where to.

00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:38.189
Doesn't mean we know how to start
and if the slides show up, hopefully

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.220
you'll see that, that statement
just because we know where to start

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.480
doesn't mean we know how to start.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.650
So Paul makes that statement and he
says, first of all, pray so great.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.880
There's a starting point.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.170
That's what we should do.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.780
And I think about this, I say, should
we keep, I'm going to use that word

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:52.980
probably too much today as well.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:59.069
I find myself where I look at my life and
I go, okay, I think I need to be healthy.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.230
And I want to work out.

00:10:01.275 --> 00:10:02.595
Where should I start the gym?

00:10:02.625 --> 00:10:05.775
But when I get there, y'all ever seen
somebody use the gym equipment wrong.

00:10:06.645 --> 00:10:07.995
You're there going, whoa, buddy.

00:10:07.995 --> 00:10:11.025
Like, no, you use your
arms, not your legs.

00:10:11.205 --> 00:10:11.535
Right.

00:10:12.135 --> 00:10:14.925
Well, what happens is we go to the
gym and usually we don't work out well

00:10:14.925 --> 00:10:18.075
because we're, we don't know how the
equipment works and then work flustered.

00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:19.935
And then we leave because
we're embarrassed.

00:10:21.465 --> 00:10:22.815
We'll see, this is with prayer.

00:10:22.845 --> 00:10:27.735
I see Paul saying, Hey, prioritize prayer,
but you may be just like me and you may

00:10:27.735 --> 00:10:29.655
say, but I don't really fully understand.

00:10:30.615 --> 00:10:33.705
So, let me give you just a
practical example of why I

00:10:33.705 --> 00:10:34.725
can relate with you in this.

00:10:35.205 --> 00:10:38.655
I'm a new believer in the church
to skate my life to Christ there.

00:10:38.685 --> 00:10:41.385
They're doing great with their
promotion of like what's coming up.

00:10:41.385 --> 00:10:45.375
And they said, this come
tonight, Lord supper and say,

00:10:45.385 --> 00:10:47.445
great, honey, what do we bring?

00:10:47.445 --> 00:10:48.435
What side of them did we bring?

00:10:48.765 --> 00:10:52.605
I had no clue, no clue what
the Lord's ever was communion.

00:10:53.355 --> 00:10:57.545
So I would've, I would've literally,
without her, I would have brought aside.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:04.140
To a communion service and been
embarrassed too many times in the church.

00:11:05.609 --> 00:11:07.800
We, we, we spend more time up here.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.150
You should pray.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.130
You should be in the word,
you should take communion.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.510
And most of us fake it until we make it.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:16.599
You get it right.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.560
You might, I mean, like we're going
to act like we know what that means.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.030
What are they doing?

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.589
We're going to watch them go
and then we're going to do it.

00:11:22.589 --> 00:11:23.280
And then we're going to, okay.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:23.699
I guess that's what.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.199
Today.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.000
And so reason why I'm saying
this, I had this heart because

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.079
that's where I came from.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.000
I want us all to start
at the base level, right?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.319
So we know where to start, but
we may not know how to start.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.900
We know we should prioritize
prayer, but how do we start?

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.069
So we're going to walk through that today.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.120
You guys excited about that.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.160
You get to walk through
that to Gaye today.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:46.050
So Paul says, first of all right,
pray, but he says, how do you pray?

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:50.310
And so we look at this and he says, I urge
petitions, prayers, and intercessions,

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.480
and Thanksgiving made forever.

00:11:52.365 --> 00:11:55.755
And then if I'm a new believer,
I go, what are those words?

00:11:55.995 --> 00:11:57.015
What does that even mean?

00:11:57.915 --> 00:12:02.355
And so when we look at this, we, we,
we, we, we have to start at one place

00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:04.095
before we even get to how do we pray?

00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:04.425
Right.

00:12:04.425 --> 00:12:07.755
Cause he's talking about how do we
pray, but let's look at what prayer is.

00:12:07.755 --> 00:12:12.585
And so I want to ask that question based
upon what you do know, what is prayer?

00:12:12.615 --> 00:12:13.365
What is prayer?

00:12:17.915 --> 00:12:18.965
Just talking to you.

00:12:18.965 --> 00:12:20.825
I was going to say, just so
you know, you can answer.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.430
And, and, and its right.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.300
And reason why is because this isn't
a place where you have to feel like

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.260
you have to have the right answers.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.400
Like we're learning here together.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.329
So what'd you say?

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.689
W w what was your Brittany
want to talk to God?

00:12:33.689 --> 00:12:33.930
Okay.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.189
What's another, what's another way.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:39.740
What is prayer to you to
give him things right?

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.720
Anything else?

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.270
What, what would you, how would
you define prayer asking for stuff?

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.500
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:48.610
That's one of our favorites.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.870
That's my favorite.

00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:52.545
What's that confession.

00:12:52.995 --> 00:12:54.405
Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:55.064 --> 00:12:55.635
Absolutely.

00:12:57.135 --> 00:13:01.334
So when we walk through this, we look
just saying, obviously basics of prayer

00:13:01.334 --> 00:13:02.954
is a conversation with God, right?

00:13:02.954 --> 00:13:03.885
It's a two way conversation.

00:13:03.885 --> 00:13:04.485
That's the one part.

00:13:04.665 --> 00:13:06.435
I remember somebody telling
me this with prayer.

00:13:06.675 --> 00:13:08.084
Hey, do you know, you're
supposed to listen to God.

00:13:08.084 --> 00:13:09.464
I'm like, you hear him audibly.

00:13:10.245 --> 00:13:12.015
Can I get hooked up with that connection?

00:13:12.944 --> 00:13:15.045
And what I learned through my
life, and this is where we'll

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.454
learn is God speaks to us through.

00:13:17.475 --> 00:13:18.915
He speaks to us through his word.

00:13:19.305 --> 00:13:22.755
He speaks to us through a worship service.

00:13:22.755 --> 00:13:23.775
Well, what do you mean audibly?

00:13:23.805 --> 00:13:28.275
No, it's, it's usually an inner peace
or it's an inner, uh, from, from the

00:13:28.275 --> 00:13:32.385
word you'll read and you'll go, God's
like, this is what you need to do.

00:13:33.015 --> 00:13:34.095
And so it makes sense.

00:13:34.095 --> 00:13:37.814
I love this and, and, uh, again, I'm,
I'm trying to stay on task cause I

00:13:37.814 --> 00:13:42.495
know we got a lot going on today, but,
um, Brian Jones joined us on a men's

00:13:42.495 --> 00:13:43.615
discipleship group on a Monday night.

00:13:44.565 --> 00:13:45.495
To come to this thing.

00:13:45.495 --> 00:13:48.225
And he told me how he made,
made the decision to come.

00:13:49.095 --> 00:13:52.785
And this is why I want you to guys to
know it works, Lord, what should I do?

00:13:53.715 --> 00:13:55.245
I just give me something in front of me.

00:13:55.245 --> 00:13:57.975
I'm going to kind of, I think I
remember this, give me something

00:13:58.035 --> 00:13:59.535
like, let me know, give me a sign.

00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:01.455
And he picks up the shirt
and it's live inspired.

00:14:01.455 --> 00:14:02.235
It's our inspiring hope shirt.

00:14:02.235 --> 00:14:03.195
He's like, well, I guess that's my sign.

00:14:03.195 --> 00:14:04.335
I need to go to this men's group.

00:14:05.895 --> 00:14:07.125
It works that way sometimes.

00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:07.335
Right?

00:14:07.335 --> 00:14:08.685
So it's just the laundry.

00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:09.855
He should do the laundry more.

00:14:09.885 --> 00:14:10.905
Maybe got to speak to you more.

00:14:12.125 --> 00:14:13.725
I all I'm saying is.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.490
It is, it is obviously
just that conversation, but

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.960
it's also listening to God.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:20.850
It's also listening to God.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:25.830
So prayer shows our dependence upon God
as well, and it shows our need for him.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.060
So my challenge today is that
we don't need to over-complicate

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.760
prayer, but we need to make sure
we also don't undervalue it.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.300
I'll say that again.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.530
We don't need to over-complicate prayer,
but we also don't need to under value it.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:37.800
We need that.

00:14:38.535 --> 00:14:39.075
Uh, balance.

00:14:39.075 --> 00:14:40.125
So again, how do we pray?

00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:41.205
Paul gives us this answer.

00:14:41.205 --> 00:14:44.265
So if you're saying, okay, I know we
should prioritize, pray, how do we pray?

00:14:44.265 --> 00:14:45.465
We're going to break down these words.

00:14:45.735 --> 00:14:47.025
He gives us this first word.

00:14:47.025 --> 00:14:49.695
He says, I urge that
petitions be made, right?

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:51.375
What are petitions?

00:14:51.735 --> 00:14:56.175
So petitions and in your Bible could say,
supplications are prayers that include

00:14:56.175 --> 00:14:58.665
personal requests for personal needs.

00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:00.855
An example in the Bible
would be the Lord's prayer.

00:15:00.915 --> 00:15:02.505
You guys here in the Lord's prayer.

00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:03.915
It says, give us today, our daily.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.980
That's a petition or a supplication.

00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.459
Right.

00:15:08.459 --> 00:15:12.150
And so Paul is saying,
Hey, just ask for things.

00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:13.079
That's a part of prayer.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:13.680
So that's simple.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:13.920
Okay.

00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:14.880
That's one way to pray.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.819
Then he uses this word and I love how
he says his petitions and prayers.

00:15:17.819 --> 00:15:20.040
And I'm like, what's, what's in prayers.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.839
So started just studying
it a little bit more.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.740
And one of the most common terms
is prayers and it's praying

00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:27.689
to God as an act of worship.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.110
So when I mentioned
earlier, when we started.

00:15:31.905 --> 00:15:34.425
Worship service is an act of prayer.

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:38.625
It's amazing how, when you're
singing those worship songs,

00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:44.235
they're literally Thanksgiving and
praise and worship and all that.

00:15:44.625 --> 00:15:48.045
That's prayer like that blew
my mind like that's prayer.

00:15:48.555 --> 00:15:50.745
So that was, that was one way he
mentioned that we should pray.

00:15:51.465 --> 00:15:53.475
Then the second one
was his inner sessions.

00:15:53.685 --> 00:15:55.875
So requests on the behalf of someone else.

00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:57.135
And I love the states.

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:58.155
Is this statement.

00:15:59.115 --> 00:16:02.895
Making intercessions for
someone is standing in the gap

00:16:02.925 --> 00:16:04.125
for someone orders or here's.

00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:09.195
Another one is you're prioritizing someone
else's priorities over yours and prayer.

00:16:10.335 --> 00:16:12.435
So then he says the last
one is Thanksgiving's right.

00:16:12.435 --> 00:16:15.675
The expression of gratitude towards
God for the blessings in our life.

00:16:16.305 --> 00:16:20.025
So I'd just love to practice
a couple of these today.

00:16:20.385 --> 00:16:23.685
Now we'll get to these other things,
but why don't we by practice a

00:16:23.685 --> 00:16:25.905
couple of these, I want somebody.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.680
To just voice out loud.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.030
What is a personal request?

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.319
A prayer that you need right now?

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:33.579
Yeah.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.380
That's petitions and supplications.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.430
What's a personal request.

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:37.510
You don't have to be embarrassed.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.850
What's something we can be
praying for you about that.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.170
You would pray for yourself.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.340
Good health.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:45.670
Okay.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:46.780
Let's let's get one more,

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:50.770
but you got.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.750
Okay, so this praying for, for, for
you and for your daughter and self.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:58.500
Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.460
So think about this.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.820
Anything we pray for ourselves, and
this is what I love about prayer.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.760
We don't have to complicate
prayer by voicing that good

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.290
health prayer for my daughter.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:09.480
That's prayer to listen.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.540
I'm wanting us to look at this and
simple what our prayers worship.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.680
We already did that before.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.020
So I don't have to give that
example, intercessions, what's a

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.090
prayer request that you can pray
for somebody else that, you know,

00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:24.119
Right right now, somebody,
you know, that needs prayer.

00:17:24.179 --> 00:17:25.319
How can you intercede for them,

00:17:29.459 --> 00:17:29.730
man?

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.169
Everybody's really participating today.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:34.060
Okay.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:34.930
Calmness and their spirit.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.100
That's a great example.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:36.340
Right?

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.460
So we know people that have
anxiety or fears, right?

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.360
So a calmness in their spirit.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.400
So that's something where
we can intercede for them.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.410
And if you put a name on
it, let's say it's Paul.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.510
I don't know who Paul is, but I'm just
gonna throw, throw Paul out there.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.460
You can intercede on Paul's behalf.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.130
And here's the other thing
when you voice it, when you

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.540
think it that's prayer, right?

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.900
Cause you're sitting there thinking, okay,
man, I know that he's dealing with this.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.400
I'm praying for peace and a calm.

00:17:58.169 --> 00:17:58.889
That's prayer.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.320
It that's how simple
Paul's getting at this.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.139
Let's let's last w what's some things
we can be thinking God for today.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.699
How can you think God thing
is this thankfulness sunshine.

00:18:09.699 --> 00:18:09.939
Yes.

00:18:09.939 --> 00:18:10.659
It's warm.

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:12.520
That's a great thing to thank God.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:12.760
Right?

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.780
So in these things that we just talked
about, Paul's given us very basic things

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.719
we can ask personally, we can worship God.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.720
We can intercede or we can pray for
someone else's needs and we can give

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.760
thanks to God for the things in our lives.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.970
The blessings that we have, that's
simplistic when we think about, and

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.120
those words were big for me because
my vocabulary level is pretty low.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.050
But when I look at them and studying
them, we just broke that down to two.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.670
Now, are those the only ways we can pray?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.510
Absolutely not.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.950
What we talked about back here, um,
uh, is the prayer of repentance.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:45.000
Right.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
The prayer of surrender and there's
different ways you can pray.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.820
And one of my favorite ways to pray,
me and Brittany have learned this back

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.280
at our old church is using acrostic.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.190
Uh, so the word pray, you break it down.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.290
P is to praise God.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.980
Our is to repent a is to ask.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.670
And why is to yield and actually
started studying through Nehemiah

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.840
chapter one this morning.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.170
And Nehemiah's prayer
literally lays out to a T.

00:19:11.145 --> 00:19:14.655
With praise, repentance
asking and yielding.

00:19:15.225 --> 00:19:17.355
It's really cool how that works together.

00:19:17.355 --> 00:19:20.265
And so when we think about prayer,
sometimes we think it has to

00:19:20.265 --> 00:19:22.275
be all these things done right.

00:19:22.515 --> 00:19:23.985
In order to make the prayer work.

00:19:24.435 --> 00:19:29.055
And really prayer is a conversation
with God and it's broke down into these

00:19:29.055 --> 00:19:30.705
different ways that we can do that.

00:19:31.245 --> 00:19:34.395
So the thing that I started asking, so
this is not in the text when you sit

00:19:34.395 --> 00:19:35.685
here and go, well, why is another text?

00:19:36.015 --> 00:19:38.685
Well, Paul's talking to people that
probably understand how to pray.

00:19:38.685 --> 00:19:40.095
So I want us to think through.

00:19:41.115 --> 00:19:45.945
You ever wonder what our posture outward
posture should be when we pray anybody.

00:19:46.725 --> 00:19:49.695
I mean, cause again, you tend to typically
look around what is everybody else doing?

00:19:49.905 --> 00:19:50.205
Okay.

00:19:50.205 --> 00:19:51.915
I guess I better close
my eyes about my head.

00:19:53.295 --> 00:19:54.855
So let me let's, let's
just talk about this.

00:19:55.035 --> 00:19:57.345
What do you think are some
correct postures that we

00:19:57.345 --> 00:19:58.545
should have while we pray?

00:20:00.315 --> 00:20:00.855
Doesn't matter.

00:20:00.855 --> 00:20:01.695
Why doesn't it matter?

00:20:03.275 --> 00:20:05.165
He's always listening now.

00:20:05.255 --> 00:20:07.955
Is there value in nailing sometimes?

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:10.770
Y

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.180
it's a sign of surrender.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.580
Is, is there value in closing your eyes?

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.810
Why

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.140
not distracted?

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:28.410
Right.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.700
So many times we take these things
like nailing or, and you'll even

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.070
see in the Bible where they lay
literally POS straight on the ground.

00:20:35.955 --> 00:20:37.365
And that's like full surrender.

00:20:37.785 --> 00:20:42.915
Um, but the whole idea is, is
our posture is usually an outward

00:20:42.945 --> 00:20:45.345
profession of an inward position.

00:20:46.185 --> 00:20:52.635
So if, if I'm praising God thanking God,
it typically I'm like, Lord, thank you.

00:20:52.635 --> 00:20:55.605
Like I can literally open my eyes
and look up and say, thank you.

00:20:55.845 --> 00:20:57.975
That's prayer like inward man.

00:20:57.975 --> 00:21:01.335
If I'm struggling over some burden
that I have, sometimes I need

00:21:01.335 --> 00:21:04.875
to be on my knees and that's an
outward profession of an inward.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.870
So our, our posture is usually just
modeled after our inward heart.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:15.910
Now, if you're driving you can't kneel
while you drive or close your eyes,

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.680
that's usually we'll pray before a trip.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.940
And a lot of times I'm
like, all right, go.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.950
And, and pretty he's like open your eyes.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.650
Um, but I, I bring that up because
at times we focus more on the outward

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.530
expression than the inward expression.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.600
Paul's challenging us, first of all,
to pray in this way, these are way.

00:21:35.745 --> 00:21:38.295
Wherever you are, however you are.

00:21:38.325 --> 00:21:42.405
So I'll, I'll make it, this statement,
our, our posture should again be what it

00:21:42.405 --> 00:21:46.545
reflects on the outside or inward should
what be reflected on the outside, but

00:21:46.545 --> 00:21:51.075
there's no right way or wrong way and
less it's done out of arrogance and pride.

00:21:51.105 --> 00:21:54.165
That's where I would say is when we're
praying as the we're boasting and that's

00:21:54.165 --> 00:21:58.515
where the Pharisee that standing before
the temple, and he's praying to God.

00:21:59.294 --> 00:22:00.855
Almost with the prideful heart.

00:22:00.885 --> 00:22:02.235
And he's saying, Lord, I'm so glad.

00:22:02.235 --> 00:22:05.715
I'm not like the guy that's kneeling and
surrender that won't even come close.

00:22:05.955 --> 00:22:07.125
Now that's a wrong way to pray.

00:22:07.155 --> 00:22:07.574
Okay.

00:22:08.175 --> 00:22:09.345
But that makes sense.

00:22:09.524 --> 00:22:12.645
So when we're looking at this,
there there's not a correct posture.

00:22:12.645 --> 00:22:15.824
It's, it's really just the attitude of
the heart that may bring about that.

00:22:15.824 --> 00:22:17.175
But, but here's the challenge.

00:22:17.205 --> 00:22:18.345
Where can you pray?

00:22:18.615 --> 00:22:21.675
Give me some examples where
you can pray in the car.

00:22:21.705 --> 00:22:22.155
That's a great one.

00:22:22.155 --> 00:22:22.845
You already took mine.

00:22:24.595 --> 00:22:25.824
Whereas another place you can pray, huh?

00:22:26.544 --> 00:22:27.294
Your bedroom.

00:22:27.324 --> 00:22:27.564
Yes.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.910
Wherever you are.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.590
That's the simplest answer.

00:22:31.889 --> 00:22:32.850
And so we begin to break down.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.060
So anybody ever said this
statement, I'm too busy to pray.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:37.200
I don't have time to pray.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.610
I've used it.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.670
And here's the reason why, because the
only way, and it maybe you're not like

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:46.020
me in this, the only way I think I can
pray is if I have a quiet place in a

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:50.160
closet, somewhere on my knees with my
head bowed and eyes closed because of.

00:22:51.195 --> 00:22:54.735
Now here's the thing, those
places there's times for them.

00:22:55.274 --> 00:22:59.325
Don't, don't hear what I'm not saying
those places there's times for them, but

00:22:59.325 --> 00:23:01.335
God says that we should pray at all times.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.040
At all times that means as we go.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.320
And so my challenge a lot of
times, so anybody that's struggling

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:11.250
with prayer is as you go, you're
constantly everything you do.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.889
First of all, when you wake up
or thank you for today, like

00:23:13.889 --> 00:23:14.790
you could just be that simple.

00:23:14.879 --> 00:23:16.770
You're in the shower and
you're your mind's running.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.850
I got nine things to do, Lord,
help me know what to do and how

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.980
to do it with the right heart.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:28.470
Or give me favor, you know, it's,
it's, it's throughout the day, you

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.570
pray because you can pray anywhere.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.170
So Hosea six, six says
this, it says fry desire.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.920
And this is speaking of God, he's a
prophet that's speaking for, for God, to

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:42.990
the people he says, fried is our faithful
love and not sacrifice the knowledge

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.570
of God rather than burnt offerings.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.490
Here's what God's saying in our prayers.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:48.550
This is it.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.550
It speaks to this, this
outward and inward faith.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:57.060
I would rather God sane an inward
heart that desires to pray with

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.480
the right heart, no matter where
you are than an outward profession.

00:24:01.935 --> 00:24:05.205
So it would say this, I would rather
see you pray sincerely in your heart

00:24:05.205 --> 00:24:09.705
while you're driving then to do the
ritual prayers three times a day, just

00:24:09.705 --> 00:24:11.445
to dinner, just to say, well, we prayed.

00:24:11.955 --> 00:24:16.875
He would rather, you pray with the
right heart, no matter where you

00:24:16.875 --> 00:24:21.435
are, what your posture is then to
just do it out of ritual thinking.

00:24:21.465 --> 00:24:24.044
That's what pleases God, or man,
I prayed in front of people.

00:24:24.105 --> 00:24:26.145
I had people over for
dinner, so I better pray.

00:24:26.145 --> 00:24:26.415
So that.

00:24:27.285 --> 00:24:29.505
Religious or that it's
the right thing to do now.

00:24:29.535 --> 00:24:32.445
Pray because you desire too in that.

00:24:32.445 --> 00:24:33.615
So that's really the challenge.

00:24:33.615 --> 00:24:34.695
I think that we get here.

00:24:34.695 --> 00:24:37.575
So I think again, we try to
complicate what prayer is, how

00:24:37.575 --> 00:24:41.025
we look and where we pray so much
that we end up not praying at all.

00:24:41.805 --> 00:24:45.675
So that's my challenge is that we
don't complicate prayer, but Paul

00:24:45.675 --> 00:24:49.035
reminds us also in Ephesians six 18
that we should pray at all times.

00:24:49.035 --> 00:24:49.335
Right?

00:24:50.445 --> 00:24:53.085
So it's time to stop complicating,
prayer and focus more on

00:24:53.085 --> 00:24:55.615
consistent, open conversation
with God, no matter where we are.

00:24:56.505 --> 00:24:59.055
Then the right words, the right
place or the right outward

00:24:59.055 --> 00:25:00.375
appearance and what we do.

00:25:00.915 --> 00:25:04.455
And I believe as we do that, we
will find ourselves in the right

00:25:04.455 --> 00:25:06.615
heart and the right posture.

00:25:06.615 --> 00:25:09.555
We'll find ourselves at times with
the right attitude and the right

00:25:09.555 --> 00:25:13.275
words at the right time, rather
than finding the perfect time.

00:25:13.275 --> 00:25:15.525
And I'll give you this a great
example, and then we'll move on.

00:25:15.525 --> 00:25:20.985
We're going to get back to the text, my
wife, um, we have four kids, um, When we

00:25:20.985 --> 00:25:23.655
were early with our kids, it was always
this difficult time, because what we

00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:26.835
would say is, Brittany would say, honey,
I don't have time to get quiet time.

00:25:27.045 --> 00:25:28.035
I don't have quiet time.

00:25:28.155 --> 00:25:28.485
Every day.

00:25:28.485 --> 00:25:29.415
I'm struggling to get quiet time.

00:25:29.415 --> 00:25:31.575
Which, what that saying
is spend time with Jesus.

00:25:32.025 --> 00:25:35.025
She finally said, I'm never
calling it quiet time again.

00:25:35.445 --> 00:25:36.705
I'm calling it Jesus' time.

00:25:37.455 --> 00:25:40.365
Which means it could be chaotic
kids, screaming, needing

00:25:40.365 --> 00:25:42.975
breakfast, punching their brother.

00:25:43.035 --> 00:25:43.635
You name it.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.300
It can still be Jesus' time because the
whole time, no matter what she's doing,

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.470
she's spending time with the Lord.

00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:53.179
And sometimes something that would
take 15 minutes in a quiet time

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.179
takes an hour because it's Jesus,
not you, but it's the heart.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.990
And she's modeled that well for
me to understand that sometimes

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:03.629
we are looking for these perfect
moments to have time with God.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.840
Early in our, especially
with our famous life.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.850
Sometimes it's just chaotic
to have that perfect moment.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.950
So get it where you can, and then you grow
to having those better times later on.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:14.280
Right?

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.150
So now that we know that we are supposed
to start with prayer, and then we

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.560
know how to start with prayer, right?

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.500
With petitions, prayers, intercessions,
and Thanksgiving, and we're trying to

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.030
avoid some of the complication, right?

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.460
He begins to talk about
this, who we pray for.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:26.850
Right.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:28.500
Paul explains who we pray for.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.600
And he says this at the end of
verse one, we're still in verse one.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:30.990
It's crazy.

00:26:32.115 --> 00:26:35.055
Um, and he says, he says
to pray for everyone.

00:26:35.055 --> 00:26:38.385
He says, make these prayers for
everyone, for Kings and for all

00:26:38.385 --> 00:26:41.595
those who are in authority so that
we may lead a tranquil and quiet

00:26:41.595 --> 00:26:43.395
life in all godliness and dignity.

00:26:44.235 --> 00:26:48.014
So Paul answers that question that
we can't avoid anyone to pray for it.

00:26:48.014 --> 00:26:50.264
So why is he speaking to
Timothy directly about that?

00:26:50.264 --> 00:26:52.185
You can pray for it that you
need to pray for everyone.

00:26:53.415 --> 00:26:55.274
So we go back and I'll just
try to catch you up here.

00:26:55.274 --> 00:26:57.284
Timothy is young, young.

00:26:58.095 --> 00:27:01.035
He's also a little bit timid,
which means Paul had to

00:27:01.035 --> 00:27:02.415
consistently say, Hey, don't leave.

00:27:02.655 --> 00:27:03.915
Keep going, press forward.

00:27:03.915 --> 00:27:07.095
Address these false teachers, teach
the truth, share your testimony.

00:27:07.095 --> 00:27:07.995
It's powerful.

00:27:08.085 --> 00:27:09.705
Stand up, be faithful.

00:27:09.735 --> 00:27:14.085
So he's, he's constantly telling
Timothy these things because he

00:27:14.085 --> 00:27:16.395
knows that Timothy's flesh is weak.

00:27:16.395 --> 00:27:19.755
So you guys may be a lot like me is
you struggle in living your faith at a

00:27:19.765 --> 00:27:22.275
times and we need this encourage men.

00:27:22.305 --> 00:27:23.705
Number one, to pray for.

00:27:24.585 --> 00:27:27.254
Because if we pray first, we know
that the power comes from God

00:27:27.254 --> 00:27:28.635
and the direction comes from God.

00:27:28.845 --> 00:27:30.975
But number two, that we
pray for our enemies.

00:27:31.425 --> 00:27:33.465
See, Paul's getting ready
to address false teachers.

00:27:33.945 --> 00:27:38.175
It's difficult if you're some of you
love controversy and you love a dress.

00:27:38.265 --> 00:27:38.555
I don't know.

00:27:38.565 --> 00:27:39.045
You're crazy.

00:27:39.045 --> 00:27:43.995
If you do most of us, don't like having
to address someone with a fault in

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:45.375
their life or something that they need.

00:27:45.525 --> 00:27:46.515
We don't like to do that.

00:27:46.515 --> 00:27:47.625
So what is Paul challenging?

00:27:47.625 --> 00:27:51.075
Timothy, pray first, not only for your
own heart, but for those you're going to

00:27:51.075 --> 00:27:53.254
address and know you can't avoid your.

00:27:53.835 --> 00:27:55.335
You have to pray for them too.

00:27:55.665 --> 00:27:57.915
And the more that you pray for
your enemies, the more that your

00:27:57.915 --> 00:27:59.175
heart becomes tender for them.

00:27:59.325 --> 00:28:01.245
And also the more that God
gives you grace, in the

00:28:01.245 --> 00:28:02.535
midst of those conversations.

00:28:02.805 --> 00:28:06.285
So those in your church, those outside
of your church, people in your city and

00:28:06.285 --> 00:28:10.035
those around the world, and those that are
difficult to love, we're called to pray.

00:28:12.195 --> 00:28:15.105
And so also, Paul, doesn't just stop with
just everyone, but he gets a little more

00:28:15.105 --> 00:28:18.225
descriptive and he says for Kings and
all who are in authority and you guys

00:28:18.225 --> 00:28:19.905
may say, great, we don't have Kings.

00:28:20.205 --> 00:28:24.554
And the United States will Kings
or presidents, and then we have

00:28:24.554 --> 00:28:26.415
governors and then we have our bosses.

00:28:26.655 --> 00:28:30.014
And if you're your own boss, then I
guess you just have to pray for yourself.

00:28:30.044 --> 00:28:30.855
That's a great thing.

00:28:31.215 --> 00:28:33.095
Um, but I would even say this and this.

00:28:33.675 --> 00:28:34.845
I'm going to step this out here.

00:28:35.025 --> 00:28:38.445
You know, part of my authority as
a pastor over your life, and that's

00:28:38.445 --> 00:28:41.805
not in a subjective way or submissive
way, that's just a way of leadership.

00:28:41.835 --> 00:28:42.795
You should pray for me.

00:28:42.825 --> 00:28:45.105
I really appreciate that next being true.

00:28:45.165 --> 00:28:45.795
True and honest.

00:28:46.125 --> 00:28:46.935
Please pray for me.

00:28:46.935 --> 00:28:51.585
I hope I'm not your enemy, but please
pray for me because I needed as well.

00:28:51.645 --> 00:28:54.705
And so why do we pray what
we're going to we're in dressed

00:28:54.705 --> 00:28:56.465
that, but he says to pray for.

00:28:57.375 --> 00:28:59.925
Those in authority, not
those who treat you well.

00:28:59.985 --> 00:29:02.595
And so it's difficult sometimes
praying for those who are in

00:29:02.595 --> 00:29:05.685
authority, because we don't agree
with him, but there's a reason why.

00:29:05.685 --> 00:29:06.135
Right.

00:29:06.284 --> 00:29:08.294
So Paul doesn't exempt
anyone from the list.

00:29:09.345 --> 00:29:12.254
So why should we pray for
everyone is the question.

00:29:12.345 --> 00:29:13.665
And Paul answers that, right?

00:29:13.665 --> 00:29:17.534
He says that we can have a tranquil and
quiet life in all godliness and dignity.

00:29:17.835 --> 00:29:20.325
I looked at those four words
and I was like, okay, I don't

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:21.355
know what tranquil means.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:22.770
I figured this out.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.090
So tranquil means this.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.810
It says, uh, to, to live a
calm and free of disturbance.

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.030
So basically that's the
circumstances around us.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:35.130
So when we pray for those in authority
or those who have authority over us,

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:41.550
it can bring about calm and, and, uh,
free, uh, circumstances around us.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.730
Then he talks about this word,
quiet, which is the word peaceful,

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.410
and that's an inward attitude.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:46.770
Anyway.

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.880
Known this, when you begin to pray for
somebody, how it brings an inner peace

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.210
in your life, the more that you pray
for them, even though you may have a

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:56.940
negative view towards them, it seems
like God breaks down your heart and

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.620
you begin to view them differently.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.310
So when we pray, it actually
helps our own hearts.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.940
So that's the quiet life
that he's talking about.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.780
Then he talks about that leads to all
godliness, which sounds logical, which

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:11.010
means to leads to us, to reflect God's
character in our life when we pray.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.640
And then it leads to dignity,
which is worthy and honor.

00:30:16.605 --> 00:30:21.525
And so, because when we pray, we find
favor again with our local officials,

00:30:22.065 --> 00:30:25.245
hopefully those around the world that
are in leadership over us when we pray.

00:30:26.505 --> 00:30:29.175
And we also know the last in that
where, I mean, really I'm going

00:30:29.175 --> 00:30:32.085
to address the first three more
next week or the week after that.

00:30:32.085 --> 00:30:34.815
Cause the next week of serve
Sunday, it says in verse

00:30:34.815 --> 00:30:36.615
three, it says, this is good.

00:30:36.615 --> 00:30:38.325
And it pleases God our savior.

00:30:39.765 --> 00:30:40.325
So as.

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:42.270
Finish up today.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.250
I want to pose a couple of questions.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.200
We, we only talked about
basically two verses.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.280
We hit that third verse.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:52.650
There's a lot to do with prayer, but
I want, I want to leave you with this.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:56.850
And it just, the challenge that Paul
reminds us and Timothy, before we do

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:01.860
anything to pray, James five 16 says
this prayer, the prayer of a righteous

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.550
person is very powerful in its effect.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.830
It's powerful to pray.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.260
So I'm going to pose some
questions to you guys.

00:31:11.574 --> 00:31:15.834
If you could to do, if you could do
just one thing and it would provide a

00:31:15.834 --> 00:31:20.094
calm, peaceful life that would reflect
the character of God and gain you honor

00:31:20.094 --> 00:31:24.534
and respect, would you do it then?

00:31:24.534 --> 00:31:30.655
Prey, if you could do one thing and know
that it please God, would you do it?

00:31:31.975 --> 00:31:32.725
Do one thing.

00:31:33.415 --> 00:31:33.745
Pray.

00:31:34.615 --> 00:31:36.655
See, I look at the Bible
for face value sometimes.

00:31:37.409 --> 00:31:40.139
And I go, number one, Paul
is somebody to be trusted.

00:31:40.139 --> 00:31:41.340
We've talked about this recently.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:46.169
Paul is somebody that we can learn from
that has modeled a to follow Christ after.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.590
So what he says is valuable to me and he
says, first of all, prayed, that makes

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:53.100
me lean in and say, okay, I've got to
get this area of prayer right in my life.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.449
So first of all, we learned what prayer.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:58.320
We learned the posture of our
prayer, the words of our prayer,

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.120
we're learning how we should pray.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.300
We were trying to find that we
can do it anywhere and we know

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.920
who to pray for, which is so good.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.220
Right.

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:06.810
And its value for us.

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.650
But the thing that encourages me
is that it brings honor to God.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:14.220
And that's the desire in my life ever
since I've given my life to Christ.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.440
I really want to bring
honor to God with my life.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.870
And I have not.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.220
I'm just being honest as a pastor.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.390
I've neglected prayer at.

00:32:23.295 --> 00:32:23.595
Man.

00:32:23.595 --> 00:32:26.655
And so I sit there and it's not that
I feel guilty and a burden again,

00:32:26.655 --> 00:32:29.925
but really I look at and miss out
on the opportunity to experience.

00:32:29.955 --> 00:32:32.025
We talked about peace in my life.

00:32:32.715 --> 00:32:34.845
Well, if I miss something
opportunity to just bring honor

00:32:34.845 --> 00:32:36.795
and glory to God through prayer.

00:32:37.635 --> 00:32:39.855
So my challenge today, we,
we have something every

00:32:39.855 --> 00:32:41.565
week we, we call invitation.

00:32:42.825 --> 00:32:46.005
Um, and I explain this every week
to, I don't assume what we know it's

00:32:46.005 --> 00:32:47.985
for invitations and opportunity.

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:49.320
To everything.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:54.330
We just heard through communion
service through, um, the message to

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:59.160
say, God, what is it that I need to
apply to my life that I've missed out?

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.710
Um, and I'm challenged with a lot
of the statements I'm wanna kind of

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:05.460
remind us what we learned today to
maybe these would be the things that

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.770
you pray and ask God to help you in.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.600
But I want to challenge
you with this statement.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:14.190
Deuteronomy 29, 29 says this, the
hidden things belong to the Lord.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.400
Our God.

00:33:15.525 --> 00:33:20.475
But the revealed things belong to us
and our children forever so that we may

00:33:20.475 --> 00:33:22.515
follow all the words of this instruction.

00:33:23.775 --> 00:33:26.265
See, every time we come to
church, this is the fun part.

00:33:26.265 --> 00:33:28.485
We all leave here accountable
to what we've heard.

00:33:29.835 --> 00:33:33.285
And so we're accountable because now we
know that we should pray, but not that we

00:33:33.285 --> 00:33:35.745
should, but really there's value in it.

00:33:36.045 --> 00:33:38.955
So now that I've found value, we talked
about what were our priorities at

00:33:38.955 --> 00:33:40.485
the beginning, things that we value.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:45.300
My hope is that when you leave out
here today, you take prayer, wherever

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.320
it's been placed in your life.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.990
If it's not been the number one
priority that you move it back up

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:52.020
to the top, because you see that
it's valuable for your life to bring

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:56.340
peace, to bring honor and glory to God
that it's valuable for your family.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.840
And that it's, it's, it's really helpful
in your walk with Christ as well.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:02.460
So what is our response?

00:34:04.315 --> 00:34:07.925
Is that one that we, we, we
respond in some way, right?

00:34:07.925 --> 00:34:10.925
If we, we just learned today, what
prayer is, maybe it's just saying Lord,

00:34:10.925 --> 00:34:15.545
now that I know what prayer is that
I begin to attempt it wherever I am.

00:34:15.545 --> 00:34:19.415
However am maybe you learned how to pray
today for the first time, what to pray

00:34:19.415 --> 00:34:24.364
for specifically petitions and prayer
and Thanksgiving and intercessions.

00:34:24.364 --> 00:34:25.864
Maybe you start saying I'm
going, gonna choose one.

00:34:25.864 --> 00:34:28.655
I'm going to begin praying with praise.

00:34:28.655 --> 00:34:30.185
I'm going to be praying with thankfully.

00:34:31.304 --> 00:34:32.895
Maybe style we're pro posture.

00:34:32.895 --> 00:34:35.384
You've been focusing more on that
than you have on the N-word posture.

00:34:35.384 --> 00:34:36.614
And you're saying no, no more.

00:34:36.944 --> 00:34:37.995
I'm gonna focus on the N-word.

00:34:38.594 --> 00:34:39.764
Maybe it's where you can pray.

00:34:39.764 --> 00:34:42.174
You're gonna stop saying I'm going to
try to find the perfect time and I'm

00:34:42.194 --> 00:34:43.334
gonna start praying wherever I'm at.

00:34:44.024 --> 00:34:45.645
For some of us, it's who we pray for.

00:34:46.304 --> 00:34:48.104
It may be that one
person that you all know.

00:34:48.225 --> 00:34:51.495
I bet you there's somebody that
walked in here today that says I

00:34:51.495 --> 00:34:53.174
would never pray for this person.

00:34:53.504 --> 00:34:53.834
I pray.

00:34:53.834 --> 00:34:56.294
God breaks your heart for that
person, that she began to pray

00:34:56.294 --> 00:34:58.995
for them and why we should do.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:02.730
Maybe you leave out here today because
you want to honor God with your prayers.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.810
I don't know what it is, but
you do so invitations and

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:08.460
opportunity to just reflect.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:11.129
So a lot of times what we do is
we play a little bit music behind.

00:35:11.129 --> 00:35:13.680
We're not going to sing, but it's
an opportunity for just pray.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.540
And so you can pray with your
eyes up and we learn that, right?

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.410
You can pray with your head bowed.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:18.870
You can stand, you can kneel,
you can lay on the ground.

00:35:18.899 --> 00:35:22.500
We're not gonna make fun of you,
whatever God leads you to do pray

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:26.759
and just ask God what it is that
you need to take the next step in.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.560
And I challenged you in this.

00:35:29.475 --> 00:35:33.404
One small step will
produce big results, right?

00:35:33.435 --> 00:35:36.345
Cause we take small steps in
the area of prayer that God will

00:35:36.345 --> 00:35:39.105
show himself big in your life.

00:35:40.484 --> 00:35:42.045
But here's the last challenge.

00:35:43.395 --> 00:35:45.795
Prayer starts with the
relationship with God.

00:35:47.295 --> 00:35:53.115
Uh, I just tell you this prayer is a
conversation and I never met Brittany.

00:35:53.325 --> 00:35:55.095
How could I have a conversation with her?

00:35:55.694 --> 00:35:55.904
If I did.

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.100
So I had to start the conversation.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.170
I had to meet her.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:06.720
And then I got to have that relationship
with her and pray, say, pray, but talk.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.170
It starts with a relationship with Jesus.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.650
God so loved you.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:17.490
That's a love to you and we can
individualize this right now.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:17.730
God.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:20.130
So loved you that if you're the only
person in this world that didn't

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:21.360
know him, he would have died for you.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.390
He would have sent a son Jesus to die
for you because he loves you that much.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.550
Has never loved you more
than he ever has now.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.910
And tomorrow it's the same thing
because he, he pursues you and he's

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:33.960
given you an opportunity today.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.410
If you haven't given your life
to him, which means this to, to

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:41.580
recognize that you, apart from God
are separated from our relationship

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.880
with him, apart from God that you will
spend an eternity separated from him.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.970
But if you accept who God is,
who Jesus is that he came to save

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.290
you from that eternity separated.

00:36:53.055 --> 00:36:56.115
That you too can know God and
have that relationship with him.

00:36:56.115 --> 00:36:59.475
Romans five says this at the moment of
justification, which is a big word at the

00:36:59.475 --> 00:37:01.005
moment that you give your life to Christ.

00:37:01.275 --> 00:37:02.955
You have complete access to God.

00:37:04.485 --> 00:37:06.795
You don't need me as a pastor
to have a connection with God.

00:37:06.915 --> 00:37:08.265
It happens through Jesus.

00:37:08.654 --> 00:37:11.145
I'm just one who proclaims that message.

00:37:11.654 --> 00:37:14.895
So today, if you haven't given your
life to Jesus, if that's your next

00:37:14.895 --> 00:37:19.395
step, because if your next step is not
prayer, it's recognizing who Jesus is.

00:37:19.395 --> 00:37:20.265
And when you recognize who.

00:37:21.015 --> 00:37:25.005
Prayer is a part of the outflow of that
relationship, not a response to get it.

00:37:25.695 --> 00:37:27.645
So my challenge for you
is to take the next step.

00:37:27.674 --> 00:37:30.075
I always stand in the back
and there's probably been two

00:37:30.075 --> 00:37:31.095
people to ever come talk to me.

00:37:31.095 --> 00:37:33.765
And most of the time it's to
high five me or something, but I

00:37:33.765 --> 00:37:35.325
stayed back there for this reason.

00:37:35.565 --> 00:37:36.225
I want to talk to you.

00:37:36.225 --> 00:37:38.295
If you have questions about who Jesus is.

00:37:38.775 --> 00:37:42.255
If you have questions about prayer,
if you need to be prayed for, and

00:37:42.255 --> 00:37:44.535
you just don't know how to pray,
and you want somebody to help you,

00:37:44.535 --> 00:37:45.765
I'll be back there to pray with you.

00:37:46.185 --> 00:37:48.404
Brittany is back here as well,
to be able to pray with you.

00:37:48.945 --> 00:37:49.485
That's what we're doing.

00:37:50.145 --> 00:37:53.325
To help, but here's a, here's
my last challenge for you.

00:37:53.655 --> 00:37:57.375
If you leave out of here today and
you still feel confused about prayer

00:37:58.365 --> 00:37:59.985
and you're like, how do I even start?

00:37:59.985 --> 00:38:00.735
What do I even do?

00:38:00.735 --> 00:38:02.295
I'm still struggling.

00:38:02.625 --> 00:38:04.785
Romans 8 26 helps us.

00:38:06.195 --> 00:38:12.615
He says in the same way, the spirit, which
has God inside of us also helps us in our

00:38:12.615 --> 00:38:14.235
weakness when we don't know how to rebate.

00:38:15.375 --> 00:38:19.785
Because when we don't know what to
pray as we should, the spirit himself

00:38:19.785 --> 00:38:22.245
intercedes intercession, he helps.

00:38:23.745 --> 00:38:26.295
He helps us with an
inexpressible groanings.

00:38:26.355 --> 00:38:27.705
So here here's my challenge to you.

00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:30.555
You may not know how to pray still
your children figuring this out.

00:38:30.945 --> 00:38:34.634
If you just commit to attempt
the spirit of God inside of you

00:38:34.904 --> 00:38:37.245
will help you learn how to pray.

00:38:38.475 --> 00:38:39.195
And so will I?

00:38:39.674 --> 00:38:42.435
And so all this church, cause
we're here to walk alongside you.

00:38:42.435 --> 00:38:43.095
We're a family.

00:38:43.515 --> 00:38:44.055
So I'm going to pray.

00:38:44.835 --> 00:38:48.225
And then it just asks that you just spend
some time in the Lord asking him what

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:49.725
your next step is in the area of prayer.

00:38:50.445 --> 00:38:51.495
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:52.035
We love you.

00:38:52.035 --> 00:38:52.785
And we thank you Lord.

00:38:52.785 --> 00:38:53.235
For today.

00:38:53.235 --> 00:38:56.175
We thank you for this
time in your word, Lord.

00:38:56.175 --> 00:38:56.805
I pray

00:39:00.795 --> 00:39:07.605
Lord that today, um, that everything
that was accomplished Lord was what you

00:39:07.605 --> 00:39:10.215
wanted to accomplish, which means Lord,
I pray that every person that came in

00:39:10.215 --> 00:39:13.575
here confused on the area of prayer
Lord, that they leave out unkempt.

00:39:15.015 --> 00:39:17.535
Lord that there's someone that came
in this room, Lord, that doesn't know

00:39:17.535 --> 00:39:20.775
you personally, Lord, that they know
exactly what they need to do, which

00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:23.295
is to follow you personally, through
a personal relationship with you,

00:39:26.415 --> 00:39:29.025
or to just pray that you move in the
hearts of each person in this room to

00:39:29.025 --> 00:39:30.825
take a next step in the area of prayer.

00:39:31.365 --> 00:39:34.455
To also have an open and honest
conversation with those around us Lord

00:39:34.485 --> 00:39:38.955
at what they're struggling with Lord,
so that we can help them Lord, because

00:39:38.955 --> 00:39:41.595
you desire to have a conversation with.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:46.410
For us to know you and for you
to know us and, uh, for us to,

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:49.500
to just be encouraged by you.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:56.460
So Lord, just move like you do, and we're
going to trust you or the days ahead.

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.740
And so we just pray this
in your heavenly name.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.730
Amen.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:00.210
Amen.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.410
Hi,

00:40:57.585 --> 00:41:01.095
Um, this world is not my,

00:41:04.305 --> 00:41:06.675
so I pay

00:41:12.915 --> 00:41:21.645
for, I know you, uh, now see.

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:55.125
Speak

00:42:02.174 --> 00:42:03.945
cause all these lies

00:42:50.865 --> 00:42:51.645
I

00:44:44.445 --> 00:44:47.685
Great to be able to pray and to sing.

00:44:49.675 --> 00:44:55.365
We're going to sing one other song here,
um, just to kinda finish up the day,

00:44:56.075 --> 00:44:57.615
spend a little more time celebrating.

00:44:58.575 --> 00:45:02.145
Uh, so we have a lot to celebrate
all that God has done for us.

00:45:02.415 --> 00:45:06.195
All that, uh, all that's
going on in this church.

00:45:08.685 --> 00:45:14.025
Man, I'm excited that we get to
witness some baptisms this morning

00:45:14.085 --> 00:45:16.245
and it's going to be just a fun time.

00:45:16.245 --> 00:45:20.915
So, uh, if you guys would, if you want
to go ahead and stand with us, uh, and

00:45:20.915 --> 00:45:24.735
we're going to sing this last song here
as we, uh, as we get ready for that,

00:45:44.965 --> 00:45:47.635
ah, wind down to the creams.

00:45:58.350 --> 00:45:58.650
Right.

00:47:45.795 --> 00:47:48.855
I will shine in Gloria.

00:47:50.775 --> 00:47:52.305
Plenty calls me.

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:36.360
mercy child for.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.060
Amen.

00:49:46.335 --> 00:49:49.455
All right before we move
on to baptisms two things.

00:49:49.455 --> 00:49:52.845
Number one, I always give this as an
opportunity at the end of service,

00:49:53.265 --> 00:49:57.345
um, is if you guys would like to
give you can financially, um, as we

00:49:57.345 --> 00:50:00.195
continue to grow as a church, we want
to continue to impact our community.

00:50:00.195 --> 00:50:03.045
And that's a couple of ways you can
do that back at our next steps table.

00:50:03.045 --> 00:50:06.735
We have a box as well as online as
well, but those are always options

00:50:06.735 --> 00:50:09.585
for ways for you guys to be a part of
what God is doing here financially.

00:50:10.065 --> 00:50:11.505
So that's one things I wanted to mention.

00:50:11.535 --> 00:50:14.505
The second is we're going
to take a five minute.

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:17.890
So those who are on live stream
five minute, break those in here,

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:20.740
don't walk out and leave because
we're going to do baptisms.

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.540
That's allowed Lauren
and Brian to go change.

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:26.020
Um, but those who have kids, you need
to go get your kids and bring them out.

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.700
Cause the kids are going to be
a part of this service as well.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.080
So does that work or be good?

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:30.460
Five minutes.

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:31.330
Go

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:38.680
pray for them.

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:42.960
Um, As a couple Lord that their faith
grows stronger or that their relationship

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:46.810
with you and with each other Lord grows
stronger and Lord that they continued

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:48.420
to just lead their family to know you.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.960
And so Lord, we thank you again for this
day and we pray this in your holy name.

00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:52.650
Amen.

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:53.730
Amen.

00:51:15.365 --> 00:51:15.665
Yep.

00:51:15.855 --> 00:51:16.265
Sit down.

00:51:17.645 --> 00:51:20.254
So then what you're going to want
to do, you're going to scoot this

00:51:20.254 --> 00:51:21.935
forward and we're gonna go back slow.

00:51:21.935 --> 00:51:24.274
So if your head hits the back,
right, you won't have blood.

00:51:24.274 --> 00:51:25.265
There won't be blood in here.

00:51:26.315 --> 00:51:26.645
Okay.

00:51:26.705 --> 00:51:27.365
So if you went to.

00:51:29.444 --> 00:51:30.105
All right, Brian.

00:51:30.855 --> 00:51:33.674
So before we baptize you, I
want to ask you one question.

00:51:34.274 --> 00:51:35.714
Have you given your life to Jesus?

00:51:36.044 --> 00:51:36.285
Yes.

00:51:36.495 --> 00:51:36.975
Yes.

00:51:37.154 --> 00:51:37.785
That's awesome.

00:51:38.294 --> 00:51:41.745
I'm so excited that you get to
publicly profess that here today,

00:51:42.044 --> 00:51:43.095
and then we get to be a part of it.

00:51:43.185 --> 00:51:44.205
So I'm so proud of you.

00:51:44.654 --> 00:51:47.444
So let's get your hands in place here.

00:51:49.504 --> 00:51:50.225
All right.

00:51:51.185 --> 00:51:51.605
I don't know.

00:51:51.665 --> 00:51:53.584
Remember if that's the right way
I told you the other day either.

00:51:53.705 --> 00:51:55.415
So you can actually, that's fine.

00:51:55.595 --> 00:51:56.524
All right, Brian.

00:51:58.575 --> 00:52:03.555
Here we go, Brian, on your
profession of faith in Jesus as

00:52:03.555 --> 00:52:04.875
Lord and savior of your life.

00:52:05.265 --> 00:52:08.955
I baptize you now my brother named the
father and of the son and the holy spirit.

00:52:16.075 --> 00:52:17.605
all right now, slow, slow out.

00:52:17.725 --> 00:52:17.965
Okay.

00:52:17.965 --> 00:52:18.445
Slow out.

00:52:31.385 --> 00:52:34.805
So draft a little bit, and then if you're
going to help, let's lay that towel down

00:52:34.805 --> 00:52:36.205
so that you can nail down next to her.

00:52:36.205 --> 00:52:36.395
Okay.

00:52:36.395 --> 00:52:38.225
Cause this floor is
slippery when it's wet.

00:52:40.275 --> 00:52:40.715
No, no, no.

00:52:40.785 --> 00:52:41.535
That's her towel.

00:52:44.775 --> 00:52:45.225
You're fine.

00:52:48.955 --> 00:52:49.405
There you go.

00:52:55.185 --> 00:52:56.265
Your phone's not in your pocket.

00:52:57.674 --> 00:52:57.884
Okay.

00:52:58.814 --> 00:52:59.654
I didn't ask him that.

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:05.334
All right.

00:53:05.395 --> 00:53:07.015
I'm gonna let you sit
here for just a second.

00:53:07.134 --> 00:53:09.895
Um, I want, I wanna share with
you guys why this is important.

00:53:10.254 --> 00:53:13.495
You saw Lauren held baptized Brian,
and Brian's helping baptize Lauren.

00:53:13.495 --> 00:53:17.575
I think this is special
that families get to leave.

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:21.240
Each other, and they're a
part of this and it's special.

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:24.540
And so I'm so just happy for both of you.

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:27.780
And so Lauren, I have a
question for you, have you given

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.060
your life to Jesus, awesome.

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:31.560
Super pumped for you.

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:35.010
So today let's publicly profess that.

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:41.770
So, all right, Lauren, upon your
profession of faith in Christ, Jesus

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:45.340
as Lord and savior of your life, I
baptize you now my sister named the

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:46.900
father and of the son of the whole.

00:53:58.335 --> 00:53:59.174
slow out

00:54:04.935 --> 00:54:06.555
and this concludes our service today.

00:54:06.585 --> 00:54:07.814
Thank you guys so much.
