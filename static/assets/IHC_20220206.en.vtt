00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.720
Means a better not suck.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.170
Right.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.370
Can I say that?

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.060
I'm sorry.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.470
I should probably
shouldn't have said that.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.680
Lord.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.250
Forgive me.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.700
Um, obviously this morning's not about me.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.600
It's about the word of God.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.510
And so that's one of the coolest
things about this morning is, um,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.020
just so you guys know a little
bit, just start with this question.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.840
Anybody here have a fear of
speaking in front of people.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.130
Okay.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.650
At least three or four or five, six
of y'all you don't like speaking of.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.200
Okay.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.350
So, so, you know, I don't either, um, I've
struggled with that ever since I was a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.030
student in high school, I was homeschooled
up until I went to high school.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.540
And when I was in high school, I'm
actually sat in the back row and I refuse

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.730
to answer questions and I loved to not
go to any sort of classes, like speech,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.269
like in college, whenever we had speech,
I freaked out that I had to share.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.570
Um, and so then what the Lord
does is he laughs and he goes.

00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:55.875
You're going to preach every week
and I go, oh, okay, well, you're

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:56.685
going to have to figure this out.

00:00:56.685 --> 00:01:00.045
And so every week the Lord uses
my weakness to be able to bring

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:02.085
glory to his name in his word.

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:04.455
And I'm just challenged by that every
week that I get to stand here and go,

00:01:04.485 --> 00:01:09.285
oh, oh man, I got another message that
the Lord has prepared for each one of us.

00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:10.695
And I get the opportunity
to proclaim that.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.275
So, so, you know, um, and I was
thinking through this one when I

00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:14.925
was, uh, helping out with worship.

00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:16.395
So you guys know I don't, I play bass.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.420
Which means I know how to pluck
something and hit the right note.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.420
And so they asked me to do that
occasionally and in the midst of

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.320
that, um, it's always like I'm trying
to play the bass and I'm processing

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.320
through like presenting a message and
there's a lot going on in my brain,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.690
but I started thinking just so you
know, in the middle of that, of,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.760
um, something I want to continue to
communicate to you guys in this, um,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.250
there is nothing special about me.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.620
Um, there's and what I mean by that?

00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:44.565
Um, special obviously to God and
my family, but there's nothing

00:01:44.565 --> 00:01:48.165
special about me and the fact of
like my gifting or just who I am.

00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:51.645
It's literally the only reason
why I can stay in here today.

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:55.185
The only reason why we could come
and move from Oklahoma to help

00:01:55.185 --> 00:01:56.385
plant a church is because of.

00:01:57.705 --> 00:02:03.074
So every week I stand up here humbled,
the Lord would even use a person like

00:02:03.074 --> 00:02:04.725
me to be able to proclaim his word.

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:08.565
And so I don't say before you
confident, I'm confident in the Lord.

00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:12.525
Um, but a saying here really in a
humble state to know that I am so

00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:15.015
dependent upon the Lord every single
time I speak every single time I share.

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:17.394
And I always ask this question,
Lord, to let me know, let me know.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.270
And my wife always reminds me, you
can't mess up what God's doing.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.210
And so that's the challenge for
me today as we continue to share.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.780
Um, so I say all that to say today,
we're going to continue our series.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.810
We started a couple of weeks ago
and the book of first Timothy.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.690
And so if you want to go ahead and turn
there, if you have your phones, I guess

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.100
you don't turn there, you swipe there.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.920
Um, but we're going to be in first
Timothy chapter one, we're going to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.750
start covering verses 12 through 17.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.390
And today is a powerful message because
it is the testimony of Paul, the testimony

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.330
of Paul and we, we, we understand this
idea and this is something I'm we're

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.780
going to continue to talk about today
is there is power in our testimonies,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.130
there's power in our testimonies.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.570
Um, and so I want to ask this question,
how many people in this room have heard

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.800
a powerful message or story life story
of somebody's life that impacted you?

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.150
Anybody.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.510
Okay.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.180
So we've got a couple of people that have
just really been impacted by somebody's

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.530
life story and how they've shared it.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.380
Well, I look at it this
way is I've been impacted.

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:17.175
In a mighty way over my walk with Christ,
by multiple peoples acts of faith and

00:03:17.175 --> 00:03:19.484
stories of faith and things like that.

00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:22.484
And one of those I want to share
with you is I actually, as I was

00:03:22.484 --> 00:03:26.175
growing in my faith, um, one year I
decided which then went into be in

00:03:26.175 --> 00:03:30.405
five years, one year decided to go to
Ghana, west Africa on a mission trip.

00:03:30.704 --> 00:03:34.185
So, you know, halfway around the
world in a place that I've never been.

00:03:34.215 --> 00:03:37.005
And they hand me this book, it's called
the 10, who changed the world anyway.

00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:39.535
Read the Tinder chains of the
world or the five and change the

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:41.005
world because they have two books.

00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:43.255
Um, so the 10 who changed
the world, if you have never

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:44.125
read it, you need to read it.

00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:47.695
Um, talks about 10 missionaries who
gave their lives for the sake of the

00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:49.315
gospel, and then went all across the.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.910
To proclaim the truth.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.030
And one of those families
is John and Betty STAM.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.370
Um, and you'll see like a
little cute picture of this

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.810
and their little baby Helen.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.030
So this family decided to move
over to China to be able to share,

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.520
um, the gospel with people there.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.050
And they spent their shortly.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.700
Um, ministering to the people there.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.239
Um, and they, while they were there,
they got married, they were 27 and 28.

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.269
They got married, they had their
first child, but there was a lot

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.909
of communism, um, in the issues.

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:23.080
And some bandits that obviously came
in to their home and pulled them out

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.849
and basically began to question them.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.409
They stole all their money from them.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.270
And once they figured out
they were Christians, that's

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.110
all they needed to know.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.510
And so I'm going to give you just a brief
story with this, and it really impacted

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.710
me as I'm reading through this story.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.539
This is a family that
spent a very minimal.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.580
In China to be able to be missionaries.

00:04:39.555 --> 00:04:41.925
And they were killed for their faith.

00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:45.135
Now the little baby, here's the
miracle story right before they

00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:46.875
were taken off to go be killed.

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:50.715
The baby was put into like, basically
a little storage bin away where they

00:04:50.715 --> 00:04:54.075
couldn't find her, somebody in to find the
baby later, two days later, the baby was.

00:04:54.685 --> 00:04:55.735
Alive but hungry.

00:04:55.855 --> 00:04:57.775
And they begin to track a hundred miles.

00:04:57.775 --> 00:05:00.685
The people that had known these,
this family trick a hundred miles to

00:05:00.685 --> 00:05:03.775
save this little girl from all of the
people that were trying to kill her.

00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:07.735
And she was still alive and she grew
up and lived with her grandparents.

00:05:07.735 --> 00:05:11.215
But I say this to say this their story
impacted me, but their story really

00:05:11.215 --> 00:05:14.995
impacted multiple missionaries that
even though they saw Shorelight 27

00:05:14.995 --> 00:05:16.495
and 28, they died at a young age.

00:05:17.365 --> 00:05:19.765
Multiple people became
missionaries to the people of

00:05:19.765 --> 00:05:21.235
China because of their faith to go.

00:05:21.355 --> 00:05:23.815
Now, if you've never been around.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.100
Missionaries have given
the life for Christ.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.830
You may be thinking they're crazy, right?

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.880
They're crazy for doing that.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.850
Why would somebody go risk their lives
so that other people can know Jesus?

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.600
Here's what I'll tell you, because
that is the most important thing.

00:05:37.485 --> 00:05:41.265
That any of us could do is to make
sure that every person that we can

00:05:41.265 --> 00:05:44.355
come into contact knows who Jesus
is before they die from this earth.

00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:46.844
And so that's a story that impacted me.

00:05:47.355 --> 00:05:50.115
And so whenever I think about stories,
I think also about testimonies.

00:05:50.155 --> 00:05:53.475
So today we're talking about Paul's
testimony and Paul's testimony should

00:05:53.475 --> 00:05:56.745
impact us that same way and the way in
which he lived his life and the way in

00:05:56.745 --> 00:05:58.515
which God showed grace and mercy to him.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.140
That should challenge us, right.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.380
That should challenge us to live
our lives in such a way that would

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.950
really reflect that same, that
same commitment to the gospel.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.030
Um, and so I'm excited to be able to
share a little bit more about, um,

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.240
Paul's testimony and you're going to
actually hear from another family here,

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.340
um, that their, their testimony as well.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.100
But I wanna, I wanna, uh,
start with this question.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.780
What is, what is a test.

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:28.049
You guys probably know this answer,
but I want to know what do you, what do

00:06:28.049 --> 00:06:29.309
you, what would you call a testimony?

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:31.239
Yeah.

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:33.099
Okay.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.969
So I would say that that's
probably more of, like, if you were

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:39.909
questioned on something that you did
wrong, you admitted you're wrong.

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:42.130
So a testimony is probably more of some.

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.400
Go ahead.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.620
Okay.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.280
So if you're looking from a Christian
standpoint, a testimony is giving your

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.470
experience of coming to faith and Christ.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.160
Right.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.850
And so we're good a story, right?

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.520
So it's, it's your story,
your account of it.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.140
So that's all great answers, guys.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.720
Thank you so much, like for
engaging in this, because so many

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.800
times y'all just stare at me.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:07.150
So.

00:07:08.505 --> 00:07:09.225
This is great.

00:07:09.255 --> 00:07:10.125
Let's keep it going.

00:07:10.335 --> 00:07:10.665
Okay.

00:07:10.905 --> 00:07:12.885
So I put a couple of things up here today.

00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:18.405
Number one, uh, testimony could be, um,
in regards to being in the courtroom

00:07:18.555 --> 00:07:20.985
and right, they say, Hey, will you
come up and share your testimony?

00:07:20.985 --> 00:07:24.345
And so when we look at this, it's a
verbal communication of a firsthand

00:07:24.345 --> 00:07:26.175
experience of something someone witnessed.

00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:29.505
So if somebody said, Hey, give
me your testimony or your account

00:07:29.955 --> 00:07:34.845
of what you saw in the parking
lot when so-and-so Rob so-and-so.

00:07:34.905 --> 00:07:35.385
Well, here's my.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.210
You know, I was staying in here
and I saw this and it's my personal

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.260
account I personally experienced.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.850
So here's our Christian stand point.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.969
If we wanna talk about our testimony,
um, as a, in the church, it's

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:47.400
a firsthand experience of what
Christ has done for that person.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.690
And it's personal.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.290
What do we buy personal is obviously
if you've given your life to Christ,

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.880
there's still the same components.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.900
There's your life before.

00:07:55.865 --> 00:07:58.145
There's how you came to Christ
or come to know Christ and

00:07:58.145 --> 00:07:59.555
there's your life after Christ.

00:07:59.825 --> 00:08:01.985
But I always tell people your
testimony, doesn't end the moment

00:08:01.985 --> 00:08:02.795
you give your life to Christ.

00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:07.805
Your, your testimony is really even past
before you gave your life to Christ and

00:08:07.805 --> 00:08:09.605
it continues on until the day you die.

00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:12.005
So your testimony is a lot of things.

00:08:12.005 --> 00:08:15.725
So, so the testimony of our
life is not meant to be.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.700
It's meant to be shared.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.850
So I'll challenge you on a statement
that I have way down in my notes,

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.810
because it's challenged me lady lately
to continue to repeat our testimonies

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.740
are only powerful if they're shared,
because if we keep them to ourselves,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.300
the only person that affects is ourself.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.780
And so it's powerful because when you
hear that testimony, when you hear that

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.830
story of life change or a story I'm guys,
we can even get outside the Christian

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.330
world and to say a testimony of how.

00:08:40.424 --> 00:08:43.814
You know, somebody provided meals
for me when I was sick, it could be

00:08:43.814 --> 00:08:48.045
a testimony of, you know, something
radical that happened at work, but

00:08:48.045 --> 00:08:51.975
it's something that draws people in
and change their life to be different.

00:08:52.785 --> 00:08:53.505
And so we.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.730
Have powerful testimonies
all throughout her life.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.190
And as Christ followers, if you've
given your life to Christ, it is

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.890
the most powerful message that
so many people need to hear.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.950
And today we're going to continue to
connect these stories through Paul's

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.890
testimony, um, to how powerful they are.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.770
And so before we start with
Paul's testimony, I really want

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.100
you guys to hear a testimony of a
couple of our church members here.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.050
And so I'm going to have Joe
and Kristen come up here.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.160
I've got some great chairs.

00:09:18.344 --> 00:09:19.334
I asked them this week.

00:09:19.334 --> 00:09:21.854
And so I just want to give you a bit
of background on Joe and Kristin.

00:09:22.244 --> 00:09:25.665
So Joe and Kristin started
attending here almost.

00:09:25.694 --> 00:09:26.805
Let's here in April.

00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:27.974
You guys go ahead and come
up here and you're fine.

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:30.224
Um, April 20, 21.

00:09:30.795 --> 00:09:35.625
Um, it was, I always tell people this, we
launched like Easter Sunday and the next

00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:37.094
week we decided to have a baby dedication.

00:09:37.094 --> 00:09:40.185
We had like probably twice the amount of
people of this baby, that baby dedication.

00:09:40.185 --> 00:09:40.964
This was a Parker.

00:09:41.265 --> 00:09:43.035
Um, then we had our
launch, which was great.

00:09:43.094 --> 00:09:44.685
And you guys can go and sit
down and get comfortable.

00:09:44.775 --> 00:09:46.545
I know you're excited about
being in front of people.

00:09:47.824 --> 00:09:52.564
So they actually are, um, related
to Joshua, Megan and Joshua, Megan

00:09:52.564 --> 00:09:55.625
invited them to the baby dedication
and they came in and loved the

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:58.265
church and begin to continue to
continually be part of the church.

00:09:58.715 --> 00:10:00.935
And they ended up giving their
lives to Christ this past year.

00:10:01.295 --> 00:10:02.165
So here's the cool part.

00:10:02.165 --> 00:10:03.845
Cause I want to sit down and have
a conversation with them and hear

00:10:03.845 --> 00:10:09.035
their testimony of how this all came
about because guys, their story,

00:10:09.425 --> 00:10:12.395
I get to meet with them about w we
average about probably once every

00:10:12.395 --> 00:10:15.785
other week on Monday nights, we meet
online on zoom after their kids go.

00:10:17.035 --> 00:10:20.245
This couple challenges,
my faith every day.

00:10:21.115 --> 00:10:24.955
Like when I talk to them, I always tell
them, like, you guys inspire me, your

00:10:24.955 --> 00:10:29.995
testimony makes me a better person,
and this is why I wanted them to share.

00:10:30.065 --> 00:10:32.515
And the cool part is,
is they've just gotten.

00:10:33.945 --> 00:10:34.635
You guys are awesome.

00:10:34.635 --> 00:10:35.565
So I'm going to ask the question.

00:10:35.565 --> 00:10:36.435
So you guys are prepared.

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:38.175
I told you I wouldn't
go off, off script here.

00:10:38.175 --> 00:10:40.455
So I'm going to go to my
questions here so that I can make

00:10:40.455 --> 00:10:41.715
sure that I ask this question.

00:10:41.715 --> 00:10:45.075
So why don't you guys tell
us how you got connected?

00:10:45.075 --> 00:10:48.225
Obviously I'll give you a brief story,
but how you got connected and stayed

00:10:48.225 --> 00:10:50.145
around, I guess, to inspiring hope.

00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:53.055
Well, uh,

00:10:53.625 --> 00:10:59.235
credit to my sister-in-law Megan,
uh, Kristen and I were, uh, talking.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:06.660
A lot about, um, our faith and you know,
how we were going to raise the girls.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.839
Chloe had just come
along, uh, and you know,

00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:13.170
it was, it was Parker's dedication that
kind of sparked this and we're like,

00:11:13.199 --> 00:11:14.849
oh, they're getting him dedicated.

00:11:14.849 --> 00:11:16.319
We haven't done anything for our girls.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.060
And we wanted to live a life in Christ.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.459
Didn't know what that looked
like, trying to find a home

00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:22.709
church or a place that felt right.

00:11:22.709 --> 00:11:23.550
Because we had been to church.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.780
It just, we didn't feel like we were.

00:11:25.704 --> 00:11:27.055
Four out of it for ourselves.

00:11:27.714 --> 00:11:30.925
Um, and then literally as we're having
this serious conversation, my parents

00:11:30.925 --> 00:11:32.214
were there and I'm stressing over it.

00:11:32.245 --> 00:11:36.974
Megan comes to drop something and I was
she's the person I talked to about faith.

00:11:37.005 --> 00:11:39.344
And, um, I told her what
we were discussing inside.

00:11:39.944 --> 00:11:41.175
He handed me the invite.

00:11:41.655 --> 00:11:42.464
I think it was for Easter Sunday.

00:11:43.584 --> 00:11:45.114
Um, and so just come check it out.

00:11:45.114 --> 00:11:45.204
See,

00:11:50.425 --> 00:11:50.964
I don't think so.

00:11:50.964 --> 00:11:53.425
I think the dedication was your first
time you were here or was it the same

00:11:53.425 --> 00:11:53.665
day?

00:11:53.665 --> 00:11:54.245
Maybe.

00:11:57.655 --> 00:11:58.525
But, um,

00:12:00.405 --> 00:12:00.584
yeah.

00:12:02.545 --> 00:12:06.444
And then, um, we just kind of fell
in love with the community and seeing

00:12:06.444 --> 00:12:12.055
how everybody here had such, um,
dedication to Christ and, and what

00:12:12.055 --> 00:12:15.084
they were getting the fulfillment
in their lives that we witnessed.

00:12:15.295 --> 00:12:16.735
And it was all because of Jesus.

00:12:17.214 --> 00:12:17.964
We wanted that.

00:12:18.175 --> 00:12:21.714
And so the community made us
feel welcome and just kind of

00:12:21.714 --> 00:12:23.064
like living up to your mission.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.410
Inspiring others through, I forget the
rest of the mission, but how everyone

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:29.640
else is seeing how they were living.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.600
We wanted that too.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.920
And so we kept coming back.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.670
We felt welcome.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.460
And that's

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:33.820
awesome.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:34.030
Yeah.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.870
So like, give me just a brief picture
of like what your life was before

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.980
you started coming to inspiring hope.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.240
Like what, what would you say
your life typically look like?

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:50.490
Well, for me, uh, God was obviously
lacking absent-minded, uh, and

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.335
you know, Go to work every day.

00:12:53.335 --> 00:12:56.605
And you know, I'm working for the
family and trying to be there for the

00:12:56.605 --> 00:13:00.445
family, but, you know, I just didn't
feel whole, um, you know, I'm, I'm

00:13:00.445 --> 00:13:06.245
just, I, there was something missing
and I would wake up looking for some

00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:11.285
kind of joy and I would do this task
and then feel good for a minute.

00:13:11.285 --> 00:13:15.485
And then just I'm onto the next
task, you know, how can I, how

00:13:15.485 --> 00:13:16.865
can I make my family feel better?

00:13:16.865 --> 00:13:18.455
How can I, how can I be there for my wife?

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.449
Can I be better at work and you
know, at the end of the day it was

00:13:21.449 --> 00:13:23.640
just like something is missing.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.910
Yeah.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.280
Same living, selfishly not
realizing necessarily the,

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.449
how much I was missing out on.

00:13:32.035 --> 00:13:33.235
So kind of making that bridge.

00:13:33.235 --> 00:13:36.145
So you felt that there was something
that was not fulfilled in your life.

00:13:36.295 --> 00:13:39.265
And so being invited, inspiring hope
and getting around the community and

00:13:39.265 --> 00:13:42.105
just kind of seeing how people loved
each other and after they followed

00:13:42.105 --> 00:13:43.795
Jesus, that that kind of drew you in.

00:13:43.855 --> 00:13:46.465
And so I remember we were in the
next steps lunch when we asked you

00:13:46.465 --> 00:13:49.045
guys that question is what, what was
stopping you from giving life to Christ?

00:13:49.045 --> 00:13:52.825
And there was a lot of questions that
you had and you said really nothing.

00:13:53.185 --> 00:13:54.355
And so you guys gave your life to Christ.

00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:57.775
So, so give me kind of like a picture
of what's happened over the last, you

00:13:57.775 --> 00:13:59.395
know, eight, 10 months of your life.

00:13:59.395 --> 00:14:00.205
Like what has changed.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:09.140
I mean, just being in the word, uh,
I mean I'm praying more and more

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.980
and more, and just being with this
great community, it's great to be

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.420
here and worship with everybody.

00:14:14.689 --> 00:14:18.980
Uh, and then the get outside of, with this
community and meet the people in Hamilton.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.410
Uh, I'm having better
conversations at work.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.990
Uh, It's great.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.170
I mean, just the other day at,
you know, it snowed, I can't

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.700
find the keys to my tractor.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.770
Uh, so I can plow the driveway.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.630
I gotta take the snowblower out.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.520
The snowblower auger breaks off.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:38.540
I'm like, wow, I'm going to shovel
this driveway by hand, you know, but

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.070
there's gotta be a lesson in this Lord.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:43.820
And, uh, here I am shoveling the
driveway and my neighbor shows up with

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.360
our plow truck and she's like, Uh, you
want me to, uh, play your driveway?

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.770
I was like, yeah, that'd be great.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:50.280
How much?

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.720
And she was like, no, I'm your neighbor.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:56.250
And it was just a great conversation
and I hadn't met her before.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.030
And so I meet my neighbor and I
think here I am with a shovel and I

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.530
had these two other opportunities.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.650
Had I found the keys or the auger didn't
break with the Lord, put the shovel in

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:06.330
my hand and got to meet my neighbor.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.800
And yeah, they got to help.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:08.880
They helped me out.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.050
So it was, it was great.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:10.350
Cool.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:11.190
I love that.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:11.790
That's awesome.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.080
So, Kristen, what about you?

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.100
What's, what's been different.

00:15:15.375 --> 00:15:19.305
Um, get getting in the word I'm trying to.

00:15:20.205 --> 00:15:22.395
So I was raised Catholic and I
always thought I was a religious

00:15:22.395 --> 00:15:26.775
person, but I didn't realize, um,
like I said, what was missing.

00:15:26.775 --> 00:15:31.185
I was living in selfishly, um, and
developing that relationship by

00:15:31.185 --> 00:15:34.755
reading his word and having feeling
like I had a relationship with Jesus.

00:15:35.115 --> 00:15:40.035
It just made me less than my anxiety in
life, a lot and not feel so alone and

00:15:40.035 --> 00:15:41.835
realize what we're really living for.

00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:49.310
My girls before we eat, they say, you
know, we should pray or just little

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.660
things that they learn, um, from Bible
school that they say, it just makes

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.829
me feel, it makes my heart happy to
hear them already learning about Jesus

00:15:57.829 --> 00:16:04.560
and, um, having I've had some faith
related conversations with coworkers.

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:04.760
Yeah.

00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:05.810
Um,

00:16:09.035 --> 00:16:13.355
Not living as selfishly, I guess, living
with more conviction, like in a good way.

00:16:14.465 --> 00:16:15.005
Absolutely.

00:16:15.575 --> 00:16:15.935
Cool.

00:16:16.325 --> 00:16:18.665
I think that was one of the things
that they challenged me in my faith.

00:16:18.665 --> 00:16:20.615
Cause like I'll be talking to them
and be like, so how'd your week go?

00:16:20.615 --> 00:16:21.155
And they're like, yeah.

00:16:21.155 --> 00:16:23.885
So we were talking with our coworker
and invite him to church and I'm like,

00:16:23.885 --> 00:16:25.415
man, who did I invite this past week?

00:16:25.445 --> 00:16:25.625
You know?

00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:27.155
So like they're just not only.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.600
Coming to church and having their
faith here, their faith is their

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.110
life and they're adding it into
their family and their daily time.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.290
Um, we have a Bible app that, you
know, I know you guys are on I'm on.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.240
And typically I'm like seeing
them in the word and I'm loving

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.380
hearing how that's going.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.940
And so here's the last question for you.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.410
So you guys can be out of the spotlight.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.920
Um, what would you say to somebody who
may be considering giving their life to.

00:16:49.194 --> 00:16:53.214
I would say, uh, you know, don't
wait, just take that leap, jump in.

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:56.964
I mean, it kinda reminds me of like
how people say, oh, well, I'm gonna

00:16:56.964 --> 00:17:01.224
wait to make sure everything's,
uh, paid off before I have a child.

00:17:01.224 --> 00:17:05.365
I wanna, you know, get everything in order
so I can, I know I can afford it, but

00:17:05.365 --> 00:17:07.675
it's like, you know, uh, we're all broken.

00:17:07.675 --> 00:17:11.635
So just, uh, just jump in the Lord's
already taken care of that for you.

00:17:11.635 --> 00:17:12.425
Jesus is here for.

00:17:13.635 --> 00:17:15.075
Uh, and it would only get better,

00:17:15.194 --> 00:17:15.525
so.

00:17:15.795 --> 00:17:16.125
Amen.

00:17:16.484 --> 00:17:16.964
That's good.

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:18.885
Okay, cool.

00:17:19.065 --> 00:17:20.744
Thank you guys so much
for sharing this more.

00:17:20.744 --> 00:17:22.035
Why don't we give him a
round of applause for,

00:17:26.984 --> 00:17:29.504
so of course I say that, Hey,
who's nervous about, you know,

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:30.254
talking in front of people.

00:17:30.254 --> 00:17:31.935
And then I ask people to
come talk in front of people.

00:17:31.935 --> 00:17:36.345
So, um, I'm so thankful that they said,
yes, I talked to them on Monday night.

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:37.875
I basically didn't give them an out.

00:17:37.875 --> 00:17:43.500
And so they looked at me and they're
like, okay, So proud of them.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.300
It's been really good
getting to know them.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.660
And so testimonies are powerful guys, and
we're going to continue to see this today.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.980
So let's jump into the word.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.580
I know Ashton read this earlier for
us, but I want us to read it again.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.600
Um, first Timothy chapter
one, verse 12 says this.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.550
It says, I give, thanks.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.970
This is Paul speaking to Timothy.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.889
He says, I give thanks to Christ Jesus.

00:18:01.889 --> 00:18:05.310
Our Lord, who has strengthened
me because he has considered me

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.080
faithful, appointing me to the middle.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:12.680
Even though I was merely a, blasphemer
a persecutor and an arrogant man, but

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.750
I received mercy because I acted out of
ignorance in unbelief and the grace of

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.060
our Lord overflowed along with the faith.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.170
And the love are incorrect.

00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:26.475
This sane is trustworthy and
deserving of full acceptance Christ.

00:18:26.475 --> 00:18:30.795
Jesus came into the world to save
sinners, and I am the worst of them,

00:18:31.215 --> 00:18:33.465
but I received mercy for this reason.

00:18:33.495 --> 00:18:37.355
So that in me, the worst of them
Christ Jesus might demonstrate us as

00:18:37.365 --> 00:18:41.955
extraordinary patients as an example,
to those who would believe in him for

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:46.545
eternal life now to the king eternal
and mortal and visible only God be

00:18:46.545 --> 00:18:48.945
honor and glory forever and ever.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.990
Let's take some time to pray, Lord Jesus.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.650
We just thank you Lord for this word,
Lord, that we can be challenged with.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:55.860
Lord.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:00.420
We thank you for the testimony of Joe
and Kristen and their lives and Lord,

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:05.010
how much they've changed and how much joy
they have, um, because of that change.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.040
And so Lord, we just pray that all of
our hearts are open to your word today,

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:09.780
and we just pray this in your holy name.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.300
So just to kind of catch you up
and the first part of Timothy,

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.470
what is this book wrote for?

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.810
So Paul was an apostle, basically an
apostle basically means that he had solved

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:24.260
Jesus after his resurrection, which that
was on the road to Damascus when Jesus,

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.120
Shaun down and basically blinded him.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.180
And so the apostle Paul was a missionary.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.260
He went everywhere.

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:34.264
To plant churches and start,
you know, re basically, uh,

00:19:34.294 --> 00:19:35.554
lead people to faith in Christ.

00:19:35.554 --> 00:19:39.274
And he add workers that went along with
him and Timothy was one of his workers.

00:19:39.635 --> 00:19:40.955
And in this text, it talks about that.

00:19:40.955 --> 00:19:44.915
Timothy is a beloved son, so he really
valued his relationship with Timothy.

00:19:45.455 --> 00:19:49.804
And so he's deciding to write this letter
to Timothy, who is the pastor of emphasis.

00:19:50.044 --> 00:19:53.855
It's a church that Paul was part
of planting, and he's helping

00:19:53.855 --> 00:19:57.094
Timothy basically deal with some of
the struggles that are in church.

00:19:57.125 --> 00:19:58.054
And I don't know about y'all.

00:19:58.054 --> 00:20:00.274
If you've been in church, you know,
their struggles in the church,

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.780
And these struggles for them was
there were some false teachers.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.480
There were some men that were
in the church that were teaching

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.130
incorrectly about the gospel.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.620
They were trying to bring back
in the law and for them to

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.420
follow the law to a complete T.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.760
And if they couldn't follow the
law, then there were some, some

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.690
things missing in their life.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.550
And so people begin to be
burdened with that law.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.060
And there's some more things that we'll
talk about as this text goes on about

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.200
the things that they were burdened with.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.230
And so Paul's like, Hey, no, here's
how you address false teaching.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.440
And so here's how he told Timothy number
one, you need to address false teaching.

00:20:28.989 --> 00:20:30.610
Through love through love.

00:20:30.699 --> 00:20:32.889
And the reason why it's love is
because the false teachers were

00:20:32.889 --> 00:20:36.459
causing dissension in the church
and anger and all this infighting.

00:20:36.459 --> 00:20:40.899
And he says, no love will help deal with
this false teaching now love and truth,

00:20:40.899 --> 00:20:44.500
which means we're not going to, um, uh,
you know, shrink on truth, but we're

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.239
going to deal with it in love so that it
produces a love and an outcome of love.

00:20:49.239 --> 00:20:50.500
And so we saw that over the.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:53.400
Uh, two weeks ago when we
walked through this text.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.640
And so it kind of ends this way
as Paul kind of explains all

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.090
these people that need the law
or those who don't have Christ.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:01.980
And he says, the law is really
just a mirror and we kind

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:02.880
of described it this way.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.670
The law is a mirror to
realize that we're dirty.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.480
And I showed you guys a picture two
weeks ago of a time when I was in Africa

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.360
and it rained outside in the road, in
the back of a truck for three hours.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.050
And I got back to the place where we
were staying and I was covered in dirt.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.630
I mean, covered in dirt
and everybody was laughing.

00:21:19.515 --> 00:21:20.475
And I didn't know why.

00:21:20.745 --> 00:21:23.475
And when I went to the mirror,
I recognized my condition.

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:25.095
See, that's what the law is.

00:21:25.095 --> 00:21:28.425
The law is not meant for something
that for us to follow to a T, but it's

00:21:28.425 --> 00:21:32.535
meant to tell us that we will never
attain perfection apart from Christ.

00:21:32.565 --> 00:21:35.325
That's why Christ came so
that he could provide that.

00:21:36.465 --> 00:21:38.805
Uh, walk in that perfect
ability to fulfill the law.

00:21:38.835 --> 00:21:41.805
And so here's what Tim or
Timothy here's what Paul does.

00:21:41.895 --> 00:21:45.645
So Paul goes directly from that
and he begins to now talk about

00:21:45.645 --> 00:21:47.715
his testimony, his life change.

00:21:48.044 --> 00:21:51.165
And there's a reason why, because there's
a connection between these false teachers

00:21:51.585 --> 00:21:52.635
and there's a connection between.

00:21:53.685 --> 00:21:57.705
That Paul relates to these false teachers,
because it says in the first couple of

00:21:57.915 --> 00:22:01.995
verses in Timothy, it talks about that
these teachers were teaching ignorantly.

00:22:02.534 --> 00:22:05.445
See Paul when he was teaching
ignorantly, because it talks about

00:22:05.445 --> 00:22:06.345
this and we'll kind of get into it.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.430
God's still forgave him.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.270
And so he's trying to help these teachers
know, Hey, you're not too far gone.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.600
Even if you've made a mistake,
God still can extend his

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.740
mercy and grace towards you.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.340
And so he's actually trying to relate to
these false teachers with this message.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.629
And so that's going to challenge us today.

00:22:21.629 --> 00:22:23.010
So we're going to kind of walk
through this a little bit different.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.750
We're not going to cover
verse 12 until the end.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.550
We're going to jump into first 13.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.480
And we're going to look at Paul's life
before Christ Paul's life before Christ.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.840
It says this in the first part of 13,
he says, even though I was formerly a

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.060
blasphemer a persecutor and an arrogant.

00:22:37.095 --> 00:22:40.125
And so just to kind of give you
a little bit of background, Paul,

00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:44.445
if you study in the book of acts,
you'll see him named Saul and he got

00:22:44.445 --> 00:22:47.295
a new name because it's cool to give
new names when life change happens.

00:22:47.295 --> 00:22:47.895
I don't know.

00:22:47.925 --> 00:22:48.105
Okay.

00:22:48.105 --> 00:22:51.405
There's some, some more details of
that, but his name was Saul and he

00:22:51.405 --> 00:22:53.085
used to be a persecutor of Christians.

00:22:53.265 --> 00:22:54.255
And that's what he's talking about here.

00:22:54.255 --> 00:22:55.755
I used to persecute Christians.

00:22:55.755 --> 00:22:57.225
What does it mean to persecute Christians?

00:22:57.495 --> 00:22:58.545
It says that he was breathing.

00:22:58.575 --> 00:22:59.955
It's this an accident nine one.

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:04.065
It says that he was breathing threats
and murder against the disciples of the.

00:23:04.915 --> 00:23:10.104
So much so that he was given authority
to go, but Christians and Joe Paul also,

00:23:10.135 --> 00:23:14.274
when he was saw was the person that
whenever Steven, if you don't know Stephen

00:23:14.274 --> 00:23:17.574
again, acts you go to acts and things
around chapter six, you'll hear Stephen

00:23:17.574 --> 00:23:21.205
was one of the first deacons, servant
leaders in the church that proclaimed

00:23:21.205 --> 00:23:22.645
the gospel and they didn't like it.

00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:26.725
And so they were stoning him
to death and Paul's there.

00:23:26.725 --> 00:23:29.334
And it says that he
accepted, he was backing.

00:23:29.334 --> 00:23:31.254
He was okay with him Sonia, because they.

00:23:32.145 --> 00:23:33.345
Didn't like what he was saying.

00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:37.754
And so Paul had a rough past and
the interesting with policy, he

00:23:37.754 --> 00:23:39.735
was also really smart and the law.

00:23:40.155 --> 00:23:43.245
And so he had been trained by a guy
that I can barely pronounce his name.

00:23:44.325 --> 00:23:47.205
Um, and, and this is a really smart guy.

00:23:47.504 --> 00:23:48.794
And so we have Paul who's smart.

00:23:49.274 --> 00:23:50.294
He was zealous for the.

00:23:51.389 --> 00:23:54.870
He was a persecutor of Christians
and it says he was a blast boomer.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.199
So he denied Christ and force
other people to do the same.

00:23:58.199 --> 00:23:59.699
He used abusive powers, right?

00:23:59.699 --> 00:24:00.300
And it talks about that.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.530
He was an arrogant man.

00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:03.899
He was prideful, throwing
his weight around.

00:24:04.139 --> 00:24:07.860
He was again, creating violence
and threats, a modern day bullying.

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:09.810
That doesn't sound like a good person.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:10.260
You want to be around.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.030
Anybody want to be around Saul?

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.370
Okay, good.

00:24:14.399 --> 00:24:15.480
We're all in the same boat.

00:24:15.959 --> 00:24:16.830
I'll tell you this.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.689
Paul didn't want to be around himself.

00:24:20.195 --> 00:24:24.845
So I want to ask this question, have
you ever regretted doing something or

00:24:24.845 --> 00:24:28.805
being a person in the past that maybe
you were before anybody ever regretted,

00:24:28.835 --> 00:24:30.275
maybe how you acted in the past?

00:24:30.455 --> 00:24:32.915
I think a lot of us relate to that, right?

00:24:32.915 --> 00:24:36.635
Like for me as a parent,
there's some moments where I

00:24:36.635 --> 00:24:38.855
get really angry at my kids.

00:24:38.855 --> 00:24:42.125
And then man, I am just defeated because
I realized I shouldn't have done that now.

00:24:42.155 --> 00:24:43.595
Just, just, this is a teaching moment.

00:24:44.075 --> 00:24:46.715
When you make a mistake in front
of your kids, don't just say.

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.850
Repent and ask for forgiveness from
them too many times as parents.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:54.240
This is a side note, just so you
know, I've learning this, that when

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.630
I do something wrong in front of
my kids or around my kids, that

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:01.770
I go to them and I asked them for
forgiveness because just because I'm

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.420
an adult, doesn't mean I get a pass.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:08.250
It's teaching them and modeling to them
repentance because whenever they start

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.070
doing things wrong and they recognize
they're wrong, you don't have to

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.180
tell them to go ask for forgiveness.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:12.930
They'll go do it them.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.420
Side note, but it's great.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.220
So we know this right.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:21.510
We don't like sometimes the way we
used to be and neither did Paul.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:26.010
And sometimes we look at our past and
we start saying, Could God ever forgive

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:31.530
me, can I ever overcome this, this,
whatever you want to call this, this past

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:36.300
of mine, of how I talked or how I acted
or who I was or who, what I didn't do.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:39.150
And for some of you, you may say,
Hey, I've always been a decent person.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.570
And so that may not relate to
you, but we do know that obviously

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.890
all of us are not perfect.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:44.550
This side of.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:49.710
And so when we look back, um, and
whenever I look back on my life, I know

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.470
that there was some things in my life
before I give my life to Christ that

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.920
man, I just, even to this day, I'm like,
man, I hope nobody figures this one out.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.139
And you guys may be saying, Hey, I'm
going to go to get some dirt on you.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.010
Go ahead.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.450
I'll ask for forgiveness on it.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.500
But that was in the past.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:01.830
Right.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.060
But I realized this if Christ had never
come into my life, where would I be?

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.050
Where would I.

00:26:08.054 --> 00:26:09.885
I would not be anywhere
where I'm at guaranteed.

00:26:09.915 --> 00:26:13.155
I probably wouldn't be in Cincinnati
guarantee that, but I always ask

00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:14.024
this question, where would I be?

00:26:14.445 --> 00:26:17.445
I remember before I gave my life to Christ
and this is why I'm sitting here relating

00:26:17.445 --> 00:26:19.034
with Paul before I gave my life to Christ.

00:26:19.455 --> 00:26:20.985
I don't know if our
marriage would have made it.

00:26:22.304 --> 00:26:23.564
We had a young child.

00:26:23.594 --> 00:26:25.485
I don't know if it would
have, we would have made it.

00:26:25.754 --> 00:26:26.985
I was not a good person.

00:26:27.344 --> 00:26:28.395
I was angry all the time.

00:26:28.425 --> 00:26:29.235
I was greedy.

00:26:29.925 --> 00:26:32.804
I was selfish and it was
all about me even though.

00:26:34.145 --> 00:26:37.745
And so until God changed
that I just that's who I was.

00:26:38.075 --> 00:26:39.125
And so you can hate me.

00:26:39.245 --> 00:26:39.905
Go ahead.

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:40.925
God forgave me.

00:26:40.925 --> 00:26:41.675
I hope you do too.

00:26:41.735 --> 00:26:42.065
Okay.

00:26:42.695 --> 00:26:47.345
But when we think about this as our
past does not define us, that's what

00:26:47.345 --> 00:26:48.905
Paul was trying to remind Timothy.

00:26:48.905 --> 00:26:50.305
He's trying to remind
these false teachers.

00:26:50.315 --> 00:26:51.905
He's trying to remind us our past.

00:26:51.905 --> 00:26:52.565
Doesn't define a sense.

00:26:52.565 --> 00:26:56.795
So, you know, what is our past, do you
know, your past could have been five

00:26:56.795 --> 00:27:02.255
minutes ago about the negative thought
that you just had too many times the.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:04.440
Which we do all have an enemy.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:09.630
It tries to take our past and say, this
is who you are and God looks at you.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.670
And he says, this is not who you are.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.350
You are a child of God.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.720
And so when you give your life to
Christ, when you ask God to forgive

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.550
you, you are completely clean.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.190
He looks at you as though
you have not sinned.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.860
Whenever you ask for forgiveness,
when you give your life to Christ.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.500
So that was Paul's life
before Christ, right?

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:29.610
He was a persecutor and a blast
femur and an arrogant man.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.200
All of us probably have some form of.

00:27:32.085 --> 00:27:33.495
But that past does not define us.

00:27:33.825 --> 00:27:36.585
So now let's talk about how
Paul came to faith in Christ.

00:27:36.795 --> 00:27:42.465
So we see here on the other side of,
uh, the verse 13, it says, um, but I

00:27:42.465 --> 00:27:47.265
received mercy because I acted out of
ignorance and unbelief and the grace

00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:50.475
of our Lord overflowed along with
faith and love that are in Christ.

00:27:50.475 --> 00:27:50.985
Jesus.

00:27:51.885 --> 00:27:54.915
Again, I began to ask myself this
question if Paul was a murder,

00:27:54.915 --> 00:27:57.555
because murder seems to be a little
bit higher up on the sin ratio.

00:27:57.585 --> 00:28:00.585
I don't know about you all, but it
seems like a mine murder is pretty bad.

00:28:01.305 --> 00:28:05.355
I sorta thinking, how could Paul
have ever been forgiven of his sins?

00:28:05.715 --> 00:28:07.095
Didn't he just send too much?

00:28:07.245 --> 00:28:08.925
Wasn't that just too far.

00:28:09.795 --> 00:28:13.545
And for me it may be,
but for God, it's not.

00:28:13.545 --> 00:28:16.035
And so I've been in thinking about
this, how could God ever save a

00:28:16.035 --> 00:28:17.925
blaspheming persecutor who was arrogant?

00:28:17.925 --> 00:28:24.105
Like Paul Jesus, that's the only
way that he could be saved as Jesus,

00:28:24.105 --> 00:28:27.195
because Jesus died in Paul's place
and took the punishment of this.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:33.580
I'm telling you there's some times where
I wonder, and I say the same thing, Lord,

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:39.520
how could you save a blast Famer and
arrogant and angry, greedy, selfish person

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:47.050
like me and you know what the Lord says,
Jesus, because I could not do it myself.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.630
I would have made a mistake at least once.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:50.470
And that's what y'all made me think.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:55.090
I'm a great person you may be, but you
know, there's something in your life that

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.860
has not been right, at least in your life.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.129
Unless you're a baby and you're just cute.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:02.129
Um, sorry.

00:29:02.129 --> 00:29:02.940
That's just a great note.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.710
I saw too many babies around
here that are really cute.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:11.520
Um, so we look here at verse part
first 13, it says God gave Paul mercy.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:12.870
And so here's what mercy is.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.409
It's not giving Paul what he does.

00:29:15.655 --> 00:29:16.665
Not giving poverty deserves.

00:29:16.665 --> 00:29:19.855
So the punishment that Paul deserved
for his sins, eternity separated

00:29:19.855 --> 00:29:21.295
from God, was not given to him.

00:29:21.625 --> 00:29:23.215
So it says that mercy was given to him.

00:29:23.215 --> 00:29:25.735
And then it says grace
was given to him as well.

00:29:25.735 --> 00:29:28.825
But mercy was given him not
because of his unbelief.

00:29:28.825 --> 00:29:29.935
It was really his ignorance.

00:29:29.935 --> 00:29:32.515
And that's why he was specifically saying
here was my ignorance of unrelieved.

00:29:32.545 --> 00:29:36.475
He lacked the information, the
understanding he had never met Christ.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.300
And so this is what you would say as well.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.730
You know, my past is out of
ignorance, the way I've acted.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:46.170
And so, you know, I can't be, you know,
punished, I received mercy, right?

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.230
When you can today, before you leave.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.090
So, you know, you've sat under the gospel.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:55.500
You have been extended mercy today
by God, grace, by God, no matter what

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.030
your past is, you can be forgiven.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.850
But if you walk out of here
today, it's not ignorance anymore.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:01.700
You've heard.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.580
So Paul was like in the ignorant
phase, which means it's a lot

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:10.650
more understandable, but when we
actively reject God, that's on us.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:11.460
It's not on him.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.840
God is always.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.640
And so knowingly since I'll just give
you an example of what it is about

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.750
those who normally send it Hebrews 10
26 says this for, if we deliberately go

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:26.130
on sending after receiving the knowledge
of truth, there is no longer remains

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:30.210
a sacrifice for sin, but a terrifying
expectation of judgment and fury of

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.310
fire about to consume the adversaries.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.680
So I would just say this,
if you know, only reject.

00:30:36.014 --> 00:30:36.885
It's on you.

00:30:37.125 --> 00:30:40.395
It's no longer on your
ignorance or on anybody else.

00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:42.254
We've clearly communicated that.

00:30:42.735 --> 00:30:45.705
And so I think that's important
to know because too many times

00:30:45.705 --> 00:30:46.784
is, is this is the question.

00:30:46.784 --> 00:30:48.284
Should we go share the gospel?

00:30:48.584 --> 00:30:50.415
If people hang out in
ignorance, isn't that great?

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:53.564
No, because at the end of their
life, they'll all stand before God.

00:30:53.564 --> 00:30:56.834
And so we are part of helping other
people not be ignorant anymore.

00:30:56.925 --> 00:30:59.324
And so, you know, the anger
is such back in Oklahoma.

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:02.235
That was, uh, if you said somebody was
ignorant, you pretty much got an, a.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.710
I'm pretty sure you're
going to just get beat up.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:06.990
Ignorant is not like a bad thing.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.890
It's shit to know.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.390
You didn't have the knowledge.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:09.930
You just didn't know.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:11.220
So it's not like calling you dumb.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.690
It's just really good to know.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.810
And most of us, as we grew up,
as kids in school were ignorant

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.600
because we haven't got to that
point where we know algebra one.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.120
I don't know if I still know
algebra one, but still, maybe

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.110
I'll just keep claiming ignorance.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.370
They don't give me an a for it though.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:26.730
Um, I keep giving horrible
jokes up here by the way.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:29.370
Um, so let me give you some examples here.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:29.640
So guys.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:33.449
Paul grace as well, giving
him what he did deserve.

00:31:33.449 --> 00:31:33.659
Right?

00:31:33.659 --> 00:31:37.530
So he gave him forgiveness and eternal
life with God and freedom from sin.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:41.159
So I'm going to try to build a bridge here
for you to kind of help this make sense.

00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:45.090
How many of you have been pulled
over by a cop for speeding?

00:31:45.149 --> 00:31:45.389
Anytime.

00:31:46.649 --> 00:31:47.100
Okay.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:48.419
See this picture here.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.470
There's two ladies.

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.690
The only ones that get warnings
are ladies, by the way.

00:31:51.929 --> 00:31:53.159
That's why I put two pictures on there.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.290
So maybe I'm lying here.

00:31:55.379 --> 00:31:56.429
Nothing against you, ladies.

00:31:56.429 --> 00:31:57.840
It just happened to be
two pictures with ladies.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.629
So how many of you have been
stopped and given a warning?

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.010
Okay.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:08.129
This hopefully will sink for
you when we receive a warning.

00:32:08.129 --> 00:32:09.480
It doesn't go on our record.

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:14.879
As though you broke the law, you broke
the law, you sped, but a warning was.

00:32:15.915 --> 00:32:17.504
And it's not on your record.

00:32:19.995 --> 00:32:23.895
When we receive mercy and
grace, we broke the law.

00:32:24.105 --> 00:32:26.504
It's clear, we were pulled over.

00:32:26.804 --> 00:32:27.495
You're guilty.

00:32:28.665 --> 00:32:29.804
Here's what Jesus does.

00:32:30.345 --> 00:32:32.534
He gives you a warning and
he says grace and mercy.

00:32:33.105 --> 00:32:36.315
And then a great picture that
really made sense to me when I begin

00:32:36.315 --> 00:32:37.815
to merge those things together.

00:32:37.815 --> 00:32:38.745
That's what God does.

00:32:39.554 --> 00:32:42.465
And you may be saying, Hey, at what
point do I need to stop receiving

00:32:42.465 --> 00:32:45.465
mercy and grace, the moment you stop
sending, which means you're going to

00:32:45.465 --> 00:32:46.725
need it for a little while longer.

00:32:46.995 --> 00:32:47.294
Okay.

00:32:47.534 --> 00:32:50.294
And so that's continually sent to
us not to, and we'll go back to,

00:32:50.294 --> 00:32:52.304
up to Hebrews chapter 10, verse 26.

00:32:52.485 --> 00:32:55.905
We don't go on deliberately sending,
but we do know as our life's go, we will

00:32:55.905 --> 00:32:59.865
make mistakes, but those mistakes don't
define us because Jesus covers our sins.

00:32:59.865 --> 00:33:03.675
So we again, receive that mercy
and grace over and over again.

00:33:04.425 --> 00:33:07.875
As needed, not because we're going on
sending because we just want to receive

00:33:07.875 --> 00:33:11.025
it, but we get it because we know
we're going to need it in our lives.

00:33:11.025 --> 00:33:11.895
So I hope that makes sense.

00:33:11.895 --> 00:33:15.525
So grace and mercy, when we receive
it, even if we broke the law, we

00:33:15.525 --> 00:33:16.785
won't be counted towards our record.

00:33:16.785 --> 00:33:17.565
That is amazing.

00:33:17.925 --> 00:33:22.815
So Paul also mentions verse 14 here,
and he mentioned God's grace, faith

00:33:22.815 --> 00:33:24.735
and love overflowed in his life.

00:33:25.545 --> 00:33:26.715
So you guys may be wondering.

00:33:27.765 --> 00:33:28.695
Am I really thirsty.

00:33:29.145 --> 00:33:32.115
I started thinking through this and why
I'm going to do this today because I love

00:33:32.115 --> 00:33:38.235
visual aids because they make sense to me,
imagine this cup be in our life, right?

00:33:39.165 --> 00:33:42.885
And it's about, you know, a little over a
third of the way full it's, not half way.

00:33:43.725 --> 00:33:46.005
Imagine if that was the amount
of grace and mercy that God gave

00:33:46.005 --> 00:33:47.715
us, but this is our whole lives.

00:33:47.715 --> 00:33:48.375
Would it be enough?

00:33:49.635 --> 00:33:51.105
Okay, good.

00:33:51.105 --> 00:33:52.935
I'm glad you guys answered
that question quickly for me.

00:33:54.195 --> 00:33:55.875
You think that's enough
grace and mercy for you?

00:33:58.719 --> 00:34:00.189
I mean, that'll cover part of your sins.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.540
McDonnell.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:02.709
Let's keep going.

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:05.530
Cause I think this is where you
guys will probably land with me.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:09.549
You'll think right
about there just enough.

00:34:10.359 --> 00:34:11.170
Cause that's all God gives us.

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:15.100
He gives us just enough grace and
mercy because you know, that's

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.060
all we need is just enough.

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:17.529
You know what Paul says?

00:34:18.279 --> 00:34:22.870
Paul says he overflowed us with
grace and mercy and some of

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:24.040
you are going crazy right now.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:35.250
That's the God I serve, I need the
overflow because I will miss the mark.

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:43.179
And that overflow tells me I don't have
to ride a line to do just enough to

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:47.699
meet God's expectation to me because
his grace and mercy is overflowed.

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:50.440
That's what Paul saying
that speaks volumes.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:55.170
To know that I have God's grace
and mercy every day, because if I

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:58.710
didn't, oh man, I would be miserable.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.470
I would fell and I would go over it.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.030
I would not be able to meet it.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.880
And so God challenges me
with this statement today

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.710
when Paul uses that overflow.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.980
And if you go into a different
translation, he actually says this, some

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:17.070
translate the word overflow to exceedingly
abundant, grace and mercy was given.

00:35:18.615 --> 00:35:18.825
Yeah.

00:35:18.855 --> 00:35:22.125
One of my favorite verses is that
God will do exceedingly abundantly

00:35:22.125 --> 00:35:23.715
more than we can ask or think.

00:35:24.315 --> 00:35:29.805
And I started thinking about this, God
will overflow more than we can ask or

00:35:29.805 --> 00:35:34.305
think in our lives for his glory and for
our good debt that encourages me to go

00:35:34.305 --> 00:35:38.865
out and live my faith for him because
I am dependent upon God's overflowing,

00:35:38.865 --> 00:35:41.174
love grace and mercy, all of this.

00:35:42.254 --> 00:35:44.984
And then Paul says this in verse
15, and I love it because this

00:35:44.984 --> 00:35:46.395
is almost like a lean up moment.

00:35:46.395 --> 00:35:48.314
And so if you want to lean up, go for it.

00:35:48.495 --> 00:35:51.584
Selena up moment, Paul saying
this sane is trustworthy.

00:35:51.705 --> 00:35:52.424
Hey, listen up.

00:35:52.424 --> 00:35:55.334
If you've checked out the rest of the
message, if you showed up and you're

00:35:55.334 --> 00:35:58.665
half asleep because you stayed up
too late watching a movie it's okay.

00:35:58.904 --> 00:36:00.225
Jump back in today.

00:36:00.285 --> 00:36:00.855
Lean up.

00:36:00.884 --> 00:36:01.725
That's what Paul's saying.

00:36:01.725 --> 00:36:02.174
Lena.

00:36:02.685 --> 00:36:05.834
This sane is trustworthy and
deserving of full acceptance.

00:36:05.834 --> 00:36:09.404
So here's my challenge to
you, except it it's true.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.420
Full acceptance Christ.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.230
Jesus came into the world
to save sinners Christ.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.820
Jesus came into the world to save sinners.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.680
And here's what he says.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:21.810
Paul says, and I am the worst.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:28.440
So I want to ask this question, who
are the sinners in the world that

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.140
Jesus came to save your question?

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:34.790
The worst?

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:35.510
Yes.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.280
All of us.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:41.890
He says he came, that centers all centers.

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:45.110
So now here's the great
question who are centers.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:49.440
Okay.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:49.980
All of us.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.180
And so here's what the word says.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:56.220
Romans 3 23 says for all, have sinned
and fall short, the glory of God, you

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.250
may have walked in this room and you
may not like when somebody calls you a

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.070
center and trust me, I get it because
it's almost like an attack on your

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:04.650
character and that's not sending us.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.330
And so, you know, sending us missing the.

00:37:07.815 --> 00:37:10.035
You're missing the mark,
meaning you're not perfect.

00:37:10.515 --> 00:37:13.005
So if you would come into
this room and say, I'm not

00:37:13.005 --> 00:37:14.325
perfect, then you're a sinner.

00:37:14.655 --> 00:37:15.075
Sorry.

00:37:16.095 --> 00:37:21.135
And so you, because you are a sinner,
that means you need to be forgiven.

00:37:21.135 --> 00:37:24.705
You need to have someone come
and basically save you from your

00:37:24.705 --> 00:37:27.735
sin because it, apart from that,
you will spend an eternity apart.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:30.120
And that's where Jesus comes in.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:33.930
He says it's a full acceptance
that every Jesus came so that

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:35.280
all could be saved, right?

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.530
So that everyone could come to know him.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.810
He wants to save everybody because
everybody needs to be saved

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.450
from something from themselves.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.560
Sometimes I think as a kid, I really wish
that God would have saved me from the

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:54.240
punishments I received, but God cared
way more than those, those punishments.

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:55.260
He cared about the eternal.

00:37:56.605 --> 00:37:57.565
You know, I look at this way.

00:37:57.565 --> 00:38:00.384
Sometimes we look at God and
we think God is an angry God.

00:38:00.625 --> 00:38:03.174
And he just hates us and
he doesn't care about us.

00:38:03.174 --> 00:38:04.225
And you may say, well, no, I don't.

00:38:04.254 --> 00:38:07.045
There's some people that do
know our God loves us so much

00:38:07.045 --> 00:38:08.154
the number when he created us.

00:38:08.154 --> 00:38:11.484
And he says, this, you
are my greatest creation.

00:38:13.145 --> 00:38:15.815
My just so you know, my
greatest creation or my kids.

00:38:16.205 --> 00:38:16.475
Right.

00:38:16.475 --> 00:38:17.254
What I would say like that.

00:38:17.254 --> 00:38:19.205
Like they mean a lot to me.

00:38:20.254 --> 00:38:20.884
And I love that.

00:38:21.675 --> 00:38:25.035
But there's times where, when they
do wrong, I need to punish them.

00:38:25.395 --> 00:38:28.545
Not to make them feel bad for
themselves, but to help them know that

00:38:28.545 --> 00:38:30.015
that's not valuable for the lives.

00:38:30.255 --> 00:38:33.435
So when the Lord says, Hey, you've
sinned and I'm bringing grace and

00:38:33.435 --> 00:38:34.515
mercy and a better life for you.

00:38:34.515 --> 00:38:37.155
He's not saying your herb horrible person.

00:38:37.155 --> 00:38:38.475
He says, I've got a better life.

00:38:39.735 --> 00:38:40.755
I've got a better life.

00:38:41.145 --> 00:38:41.955
So God looks to you.

00:38:41.955 --> 00:38:43.365
Like, you may look at your children.

00:38:43.365 --> 00:38:43.665
If you have.

00:38:44.549 --> 00:38:47.910
And you say you love them so much that
you're willing to put things in their

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:51.930
life to draw them back to the truth,
the things that will change their lives.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.400
That's what Jesus is doing.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.810
He's coming in and he's aligning us back
with God's perfect plan for our life.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:00.600
And that comes through grace and mercy.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.810
So if you're sitting in this room and
maybe you're wondering if you could be

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:07.620
saved, Paul himself gives us this answer.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:12.000
If Paul was the worst of them and
he was saved, what's the answer.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.660
Can God say.

00:39:14.575 --> 00:39:15.805
Yes, he can save anyone.

00:39:15.805 --> 00:39:17.185
And this is where verse 16 comes.

00:39:17.545 --> 00:39:19.855
He says I received mercy for this reason.

00:39:19.855 --> 00:39:24.175
So that in me, the worst of them Christ
Jesus might demonstrate his extraordinary

00:39:24.175 --> 00:39:28.345
patience as an example, to those who
would believe in him for eternal life.

00:39:30.235 --> 00:39:33.865
Even if you have a past, even if
you fallen away, even if you've

00:39:33.865 --> 00:39:36.445
rejected, God, God can still save you.

00:39:36.685 --> 00:39:40.675
And I love Paul's example with
this is because if Paul is saying

00:39:40.675 --> 00:39:41.605
he's the worst of the worst.

00:39:42.735 --> 00:39:45.345
And there's nobody that
can say I can't be saved.

00:39:46.065 --> 00:39:50.235
And I hope you know that today is if
you've done something, if your past

00:39:50.235 --> 00:39:55.005
has been rough, if I don't know what
it is, God is saying, you can be

00:39:55.005 --> 00:39:58.575
forgiven and you can be saved and you
can experience eternal life with him.

00:39:58.575 --> 00:40:00.645
And you can experience a personal
daily relationship with him.

00:40:00.645 --> 00:40:03.855
And that's the one I typically
push the most, most pastors will,

00:40:04.005 --> 00:40:05.295
will say, you're going to have.

00:40:06.645 --> 00:40:09.345
And here's the thing Aternity is coming
in and we're going to go one place.

00:40:09.585 --> 00:40:13.095
I really, as a pastor, once you
experienced heaven now, do you

00:40:13.095 --> 00:40:14.295
know how you experience heaven now?

00:40:14.865 --> 00:40:19.964
Jesus, through a daily relationship with
him to experience his love, joy, peace,

00:40:19.964 --> 00:40:24.255
patience, kindness, all those other
fruits of the spirit that God gives us.

00:40:24.615 --> 00:40:26.115
You can experience it now.

00:40:26.625 --> 00:40:28.904
And so, you know, Joe and
Chris, and what was the thing?

00:40:28.904 --> 00:40:31.455
They mentioned the community.

00:40:32.355 --> 00:40:34.904
You want to know why they,
they wanted to experience.

00:40:36.075 --> 00:40:40.605
This side of heaven is because they saw
the community that they could receive

00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:45.585
it now because they receive friends
and people who encourage them and pray

00:40:45.585 --> 00:40:49.335
for them and reach out when they're
sick and love them and love their

00:40:49.335 --> 00:40:52.904
kids and, and show who Christ is here.

00:40:54.375 --> 00:40:57.345
I'm telling you guys like to me as
a pastor, I want you to experience.

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:00.660
I don't want you to experience hell
either, but I want you to experience

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:05.040
that more because it's something that
man it's changed my life and it's

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.810
changed so many other people's lives.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:09.569
So what happens?

00:41:09.569 --> 00:41:12.359
So we see Paul's life before
Christ, how he came to Christ.

00:41:12.359 --> 00:41:13.620
He received grace and mercy.

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:18.810
That overflowed what happened after the.

00:41:20.025 --> 00:41:20.865
Paul's life was changed.

00:41:20.865 --> 00:41:22.065
This is where verse 12 comes in.

00:41:22.275 --> 00:41:25.785
Paul is saying, I give thanks to
Christ Jesus, our Lord, who has

00:41:25.785 --> 00:41:29.205
strengthened me because he considered
me faithful, appointing me to ministry.

00:41:30.194 --> 00:41:32.265
See God appointed Paul to ministry.

00:41:32.985 --> 00:41:35.705
And you guys heard Laura earlier
say that she was surrendering

00:41:35.715 --> 00:41:39.795
the ministry, and there's a call
that God places on different

00:41:39.795 --> 00:41:41.265
people's lives for different roles.

00:41:42.165 --> 00:41:46.995
And my challenge today with this and
in the same thing with Paul is every

00:41:46.995 --> 00:41:48.194
one of us has a call in our lives.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:53.310
It may not be ministry like in the, in
the context in which Laura is talking

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:57.180
about or a ministry as a pastor,
every one of us is called a ministry.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.410
And you maybe say what?

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:03.900
Well as a pastor, my role in the ministry
is to equip the saints followers of

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.570
Jesus to do the work of the ministry.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.220
So if you're going to do the work
of the ministry, doesn't that mean?

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.990
Every one of us has a ministry role.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.130
Does that make sense?

00:42:14.985 --> 00:42:18.765
So this is Paul saying I'm giving
thanks to God for what he did for me.

00:42:18.795 --> 00:42:20.715
Now that I've been saved every one of us.

00:42:20.715 --> 00:42:22.755
So, you know, you can't
skate out from this today.

00:42:23.085 --> 00:42:27.675
Every one of us that have been saved
by God's grace and mercy overflowed

00:42:27.675 --> 00:42:29.925
with it has a minister call.

00:42:31.745 --> 00:42:33.005
Now that may scare you to death.

00:42:33.545 --> 00:42:34.145
The scare you.

00:42:35.585 --> 00:42:35.885
Okay.

00:42:36.045 --> 00:42:38.465
Couple of you rush y'all don't know
what you're getting yourself into.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:39.840
Joking.

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.260
It's a good thing though,
because Paul was able to praise

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.850
God for the call of ministry.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:47.040
And just so you know,
this is the cool part.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:47.940
It's crazy.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:48.630
It's cool.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.210
Paul's writing this letter and prison.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:57.630
So Paul's ministry got him a spot in
prison and he's praising God for it.

00:42:58.830 --> 00:42:59.340
Why?

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.300
Why?

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.360
Because Paul didn't see the prison walls.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:08.130
Paul Paul saw the
kingdom of God expanding.

00:43:09.735 --> 00:43:14.145
Across the whole world because people
took the message and they shared it.

00:43:15.915 --> 00:43:19.065
This is what Timothy is getting, is
the message of the gospel straight

00:43:19.065 --> 00:43:23.295
from Paul to go share this love
with other people so that other

00:43:23.295 --> 00:43:24.465
people can know they can be saved.

00:43:25.725 --> 00:43:28.275
See guys, sometimes our ministry
is not going to put us up in

00:43:28.275 --> 00:43:30.525
a penthouse, $100,000 salary.

00:43:31.095 --> 00:43:33.105
And most of us probably
never going to get that.

00:43:33.105 --> 00:43:33.675
Maybe you do, but.

00:43:34.544 --> 00:43:38.115
But what it's going to get you is
the love of Christ and the ability

00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:39.254
to influence and affect others.

00:43:39.524 --> 00:43:40.785
So I'll go back to this.

00:43:41.895 --> 00:43:44.805
Your testimony is powerful.

00:43:45.705 --> 00:43:48.345
Paul's testimony is powerful, but I want
to challenge you with this question.

00:43:48.615 --> 00:43:52.904
What if Paul didn't share his
testimony would lives be changed?

00:43:54.575 --> 00:43:57.154
I don't think he could have wrote
half the new Testament like he did.

00:43:57.634 --> 00:43:59.194
If he didn't share his testimony,
what would he have to sh.

00:44:01.445 --> 00:44:04.835
It was powerful because we read
it and we're encouraged by it.

00:44:05.045 --> 00:44:11.765
So what if someone's waiting on you to
share your testimony, the boldly go out

00:44:11.765 --> 00:44:13.295
and proclaim the truth of the gospel.

00:44:13.835 --> 00:44:18.965
Somebody waiting on you to be changed,
man, I don't want them waiting anymore.

00:44:19.895 --> 00:44:20.615
I don't, I don't.

00:44:20.645 --> 00:44:21.905
So I'm going to continue to share.

00:44:22.325 --> 00:44:24.725
I'm going to continue to be
bold with my faith, not bold and

00:44:24.725 --> 00:44:27.545
arrogant, bold with love and true.

00:44:28.765 --> 00:44:32.185
That they can experience Christ
Jesus, this side of heaven,

00:44:32.185 --> 00:44:35.095
that they can experience grace
and mercy, this side of heaven.

00:44:37.805 --> 00:44:39.065
So I want to challenge
you with this statement.

00:44:39.065 --> 00:44:43.925
When someone obeys God's call to serve
him, he will always equip and enable them.

00:44:44.705 --> 00:44:45.275
I'll say that again.

00:44:45.395 --> 00:44:50.045
When someone obeys God's call to serve
him, he will always equip and enable.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.379
To do the work that they're called to do.

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:55.470
So if you feel like, oh man, I'm
called to ministry, or I'm called

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.740
to a ministry role of some form
living my life out for Christ.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:44:59.790
How do I do it?

00:44:59.819 --> 00:45:00.270
Great.

00:45:00.629 --> 00:45:05.640
If you say yes, like Laura sock, Matt,
he will provide a way, if you say

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.799
yes, God will take a person that loves
sitting in the back row and not public

00:45:10.799 --> 00:45:14.669
speaking and place them in front of
people who every week he's nauseous to

00:45:14.669 --> 00:45:18.839
his stomach and wonders if he's making
a difference, because it's not about.

00:45:20.295 --> 00:45:23.205
And my abilities, God, didn't
say, Hey, you bring a lot to

00:45:23.205 --> 00:45:24.465
the table and I'm gonna use it.

00:45:24.915 --> 00:45:26.145
He says, I bring it all to the table.

00:45:27.015 --> 00:45:31.695
And I'll work through you despite
your pass, despite your brokenness,

00:45:31.815 --> 00:45:34.755
despite whatever you think is
holding you back from serving

00:45:34.755 --> 00:45:36.435
him the way he's called you to.

00:45:36.675 --> 00:45:38.805
So verse 17, I know I'm kind
of going along today, but

00:45:38.805 --> 00:45:42.765
verse 17 kind of concludes with
this Paul's way to praise out.

00:45:42.975 --> 00:45:46.335
He says now, so the king eternal,
immortal, invisible, the only God

00:45:46.335 --> 00:45:47.895
be honor and glory forever and ever.

00:45:47.895 --> 00:45:48.315
Amen.

00:45:48.825 --> 00:45:51.525
This is Paul's way to
praise God for his testing.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.130
Praise God for what he know is
going to change the lives of so many

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:57.390
other people through sharing it.

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:01.710
He can even praise God
in the midst of a prison.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.900
So that's amazing when we get to second
Timothy, you're going to see this.

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:10.590
You're going to see in second Timothy,
where Paul knows that he's getting

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:16.080
ready to die and he still praising
God on his way to his deathbed.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.080
There's power, there's
power in our testing.

00:46:19.905 --> 00:46:22.815
There's power Paul's testimony, there's
power and Joe, and Chris's testimony.

00:46:22.935 --> 00:46:24.225
There's power in your testimony.

00:46:28.235 --> 00:46:32.225
But if we don't share it, it
doesn't change anybody else's life.

00:46:32.825 --> 00:46:35.375
But when we share it has the
ability to change others lives.

00:46:36.545 --> 00:46:42.155
So here's the take home Paul's testimony
with this testimony we heard from Joe and

00:46:42.155 --> 00:46:44.045
Kristen, that should challenge us to do.

00:46:45.285 --> 00:46:49.185
The first, if you've never given your
life to Christ, if you don't have that,

00:46:49.395 --> 00:46:52.545
you had the before Christ, but you'd
never given your life to Christ and

00:46:52.545 --> 00:46:57.765
experience the after of the relationship
with him today is the day to say.

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:00.480
I'm not ignorant anymore, which skin.

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.740
So that word is not mean.

00:47:02.399 --> 00:47:03.930
You just didn't know before today.

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.390
Maybe the day, maybe you have
heard it before and today's the

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.370
day to accept it and say, I don't.

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:09.359
And I love this with Laura.

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:12.839
When she said her call to ministry, she
says, I just know the Lord told me to

00:47:12.839 --> 00:47:14.910
say yes, I don't have all the answers.

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.419
You know what the Lord told me whenever
I started a ministry, he said, you give

00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:20.850
me your guests and I'll show you the.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:23.810
That's what it is.

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:26.450
When you give your life to Christ, you
don't have to know all the answers.

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:30.020
You have to know enough, which means
this enough of your need for Christ, that

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:34.250
you have fallen short, that you do need
Christ, that he did send his love and

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:36.050
mercy and grace to overflow your life.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:41.930
And to begin to give you a purpose in this
life, to be a part of his bigger picture

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:43.970
of, of knowing him and helping others.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.970
So, if you haven't given your life to
Christ, I offer this every week and maybe

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.250
it's never worked because nobody's ever
come back and talked with just so your

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:55.090
nobody's ever come back to talk to me
and that's okay, but I'll tell you this.

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:59.230
If you have to chase me down, drag me
down, find somebody else because you

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:04.510
want to know Jesus come find me because
it should be that important to you.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.590
And if we need to meet somewhere,
if I need to come to your home,

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:09.790
I don't care what I need to do.

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:13.300
If you need to know Jesus, I
will crawl over mountains to.

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:16.350
And if you think I'm lying, I'm dying.

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:16.800
Okay.

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.850
That's a great one.

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:20.670
But if you need to know
Jesus, today is today.

00:48:20.759 --> 00:48:24.150
Today is the day of salvation
because we're not promised tomorrow.

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:24.840
And I'll tell you this.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:30.300
You don't want to miss out
tomorrow with Jesus, right?

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.340
You don't want to miss out
tomorrow with Jesus when you

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.870
could have him today, right?

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:35.520
Like let's not wait till tomorrow.

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.009
For those of us, who've
given our lives to Christ.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.270
What's the challenge today?

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:41.160
What should we learn
from these testimonies?

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.240
Hey, here's the challenge.

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.720
You.

00:48:44.115 --> 00:48:44.805
Habit testimony.

00:48:44.805 --> 00:48:50.385
If you've given your life to Christ,
you have a story of redemption of

00:48:50.385 --> 00:48:53.505
your life before Christ, how you came
to Christ and what God's done after.

00:48:53.955 --> 00:48:58.635
Go share it, go share it today at
lunch, call your friend, tell your

00:48:58.635 --> 00:49:03.675
coworker tomorrow I am changed
because of what God's done for me.

00:49:03.675 --> 00:49:07.005
And I want you to know it and in
whatever you do with it's great, but

00:49:07.005 --> 00:49:10.485
I just want you to know, go do it
because there's someone waiting for you.

00:49:10.485 --> 00:49:12.135
On the other side of
you sharing your time.

00:49:13.395 --> 00:49:15.524
That challenges me every week.

00:49:16.274 --> 00:49:19.065
So as we head into invitation, those are
the two things I want you to pray for.

00:49:19.305 --> 00:49:21.105
And this is typically what
we do with invitation.

00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:25.004
We try and I don't want to
be like every other church.

00:49:25.035 --> 00:49:27.375
Not that they're wrong, but we're,
we're just trying to consistently

00:49:27.375 --> 00:49:32.265
communicate the purpose of imitation
invitation is opportunity to say, Hey,

00:49:32.294 --> 00:49:33.734
I've heard a lot of information today.

00:49:34.395 --> 00:49:35.685
I want to pray for transformation.

00:49:35.685 --> 00:49:40.335
So I'm going to say this again, invitation
as an opportunity for you to stop.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:46.170
After all the information you've heard
and you begin to pray for transformation.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:51.270
God, what is it in my life that I
need to take a next step in, maybe

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:54.300
a surrender into a call of just
living your life out for them.

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.740
Maybe it's to give your life to him.

00:49:56.130 --> 00:49:57.420
Maybe it's to share your testimony.

00:49:57.509 --> 00:50:01.110
I don't know that answer, but you
do my challenge for you is this time

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:05.250
as we play lightly, that you pray
and you ask the Lord what that is.

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.210
Ask him to give you.

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:10.770
Come back and talk to me say,
Hey, pastor Ben, pray with me.

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:11.640
Help me.

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:12.630
Tell me about Jesus.

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:15.510
Maybe you need to know Jesus and
I'll share Jesus with you more,

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:17.910
but today take that next step.

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.510
And after you get an opportunity
to pray and seek the Lord, Brock's

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:24.600
gonna invite you to worship at
we'll finish our day out, worshiping

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:29.070
the Lord, the one who overflowed
us with grace and mercy and love.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:29.880
Amen.

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:31.710
Let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:32.460
You are good.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:33.450
And you are God.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:35.130
And I pray that you take
this message of truth.

00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:38.340
And you Pierce our hearts.

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:41.580
God, I wouldn't be standing here today.

00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:45.299
If my life wasn't changed, I
wouldn't be standing here today,

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:47.310
all the way from Oklahoma.

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:52.529
If you didn't place a call on my
life and Lord today, I stand here

00:50:52.529 --> 00:50:55.920
sharing a testimony of a life change.

00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:00.779
Not only of my own life, Lord, but a
testimony and a live change of Paul

00:51:00.779 --> 00:51:04.560
and the word Lord, a life change
and a testimony of Joe and Chris.

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:09.720
Uh, Lord, how you took them out of a
life that was not fulfilled out of a

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:14.730
life that was separated from you out of a
life that was, uh, lacking something to a

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:16.920
personal dedicated relationship with you.

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:20.880
One where there was so much
transformation where there's joy

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:22.380
and there's hope and there's peace.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.620
And there's wisdom brought from
you because of that relationship.

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.090
Lord, we are celebrating today.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:28.530
Powerful testimonies.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.280
But Lord, I want every person in
this room to know if they think,

00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:33.900
oh, my testimony is not powerful.

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.580
All how they are doubting you.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:35.910
Lord.

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:42.750
Any testimony of life change
has been given by you.

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:47.220
Lord is powerful because
the message is hope.

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.080
The message is joy.

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:51.270
The message is Jesus.

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:53.970
So God, I just pray for
every person in this room.

00:51:54.795 --> 00:51:58.665
To not leave here before taking a next
step, whatever it is, Lord, you're

00:51:58.665 --> 00:52:02.145
leading them to, during this time of
invitation for their hearts, Lord, to

00:52:02.145 --> 00:52:03.915
consider transformation in their life.

00:52:03.945 --> 00:52:05.505
Lord help them take a next step.

00:52:06.674 --> 00:52:08.595
Don't leave any person unchanged.

00:52:09.255 --> 00:52:13.275
But Lord, lastly, if there's one person
in this room, Lord, that doesn't know

00:52:13.275 --> 00:52:16.875
you and wants to know you, Lord, I
pray that they come back and they

00:52:16.875 --> 00:52:21.045
talk to me during invitation in the
back, and we get an opportunity to

00:52:21.045 --> 00:52:21.945
talk about how to get their life.

00:52:23.235 --> 00:52:25.365
So Lord, we pray this
in your heavenly name.

00:52:26.185 --> 00:52:26.485
Amen.
