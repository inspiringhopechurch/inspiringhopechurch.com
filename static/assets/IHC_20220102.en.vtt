00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.810
Yeah.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.650
Um, I know we probably have several
online as well, so welcome online

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.940
if you're watching us online.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.840
Um, I have got the opportunity to preach
a couple of new year's messages in the

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.330
past couple of years at past churches.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.370
And it's always that question.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.780
Hey, first message.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.350
In January.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.070
What are you gonna preach on?

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.140
It's like, eh, we're gonna
preach on something to do with

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.120
setting, you know, New year's
resolutions or something like that.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.470
And so I haven't changed.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.180
I'm going to continue on
that theme because I think

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.590
it's good as we think about.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.550
And I think the reason why is, if
any anybody's like me is I like

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.820
to start things on the first or
I like to start things on Monday.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.440
I like to start things in the new year.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.660
It's just something in my mind
that may not work for you.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.370
You may be a Wednesday guy on
Wednesday, I'm starting on something.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.670
And you're crazy if that's you,
because Mondays are the day.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.880
Okay.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.500
Mondays are the day or
new year's or the day.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.610
So it's a new year.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.330
So most of your probably.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.769
How's my life going to be different
this year than it was last year.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.769
And so because of that, I began to
just seek the word and say, Hey,

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.789
what are some things that as a begin
to, to look at, what are some things

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.740
that we can learn when it comes to
setting godly new year's resolutions?

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.680
And I kind of found some things from Paul
today that we'll kind of walk through.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.530
So we'll be in second
Corinthians chapter five.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.110
Um, starting in verse nine.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.530
Um, if you don't have a copy of
God's word, it'd be on the screen

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.620
as well as you can grab a Bible
in the back on your way out.

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:29.399
Um, or you can download the,
um, YouVersion Bible app.

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.300
It's one of my favorite apps.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.509
I always mentioned the app
because Hey, new year's resolution

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.859
may be, get in the word.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.320
And the greatest way you can do
that is take it wherever you go.

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.740
So the YouVersion Bible app could
be the greatest thing to download,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.839
um, and begin start plans.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.190
Look for me on there and you can friend
me and then we can do plans together.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.350
That may be a way to kind
of help you in the new year.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.080
So I want to start off
asking this question.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.070
Um, what.

00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:54.824
Well, let's start with last year.

00:01:54.824 --> 00:01:57.315
What were some of the new year's
resolutions you made last year?

00:01:59.964 --> 00:02:01.225
The same ones you made this year.

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:01.884
Okay.

00:02:01.884 --> 00:02:04.675
Did anybody like fulfill one of
their new year's resolutions?

00:02:04.675 --> 00:02:05.005
Anybody?

00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:05.725
Remember what there?

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:06.465
Okay.

00:02:06.465 --> 00:02:10.935
Hey, what'd you fulfill you were you
weren't going to work out more or

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:14.234
you were, and did you work out more?

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:17.144
Hey, success, there's one person.

00:02:17.175 --> 00:02:22.334
Anybody else successful in 2021 as
something that you had a resolution for?

00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:26.585
Okay, let's move to 20, 22.

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:31.115
What are some new year's resolutions
that you've set today or maybe yesterday

00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:34.505
or the day before that, whatever, um,
that you're wanting to fulfill in 2026?

00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:39.895
What are some new things that you
guys, you just want to be surprised?

00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:43.885
That means you're never failing
and you're always successful.

00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:44.185
Right?

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:44.845
That's good.

00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:45.625
Okay.

00:02:45.655 --> 00:02:46.555
Any anybody else?

00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:47.665
What's some new ones.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.665
Maybe nobody's even said anything.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.510
Anybody spend more time with family.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.080
There you go.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.830
Okay.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.630
What was the other one?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.540
I heard somebody else talk.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.390
You didn't set any, okay.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.010
Yeah.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.550
Well, when, when they, when they
say around the 21st of January is

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.400
when everybody's gym membership,
like they stop showing up.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.110
Yes, yes.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.980
We all tend to.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.200
So let me ask this question then.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.090
How many of y'all would
like to be successful?

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.310
At actually following through on
new year's resolutions, anybody.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.690
Okay, good.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.130
Most of us are on the same page and here's
what I'll encourage you with is it doesn't

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.410
take every new year's to set resolutions.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.450
Um, so I want to kind of explain.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.410
So what's a resolution is a firm
decision to do or not do something.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.310
A resolution is a firm decision
to do or not do something.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.160
So those can be set every
day or like may Mondays.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.530
So don't wait until next year.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.470
If you set something today
and you fell in 21, Don't wait

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.670
until next year to do it again.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.440
It really just takes the next day.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.060
And this is one of the
things as me and Brittany.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.580
We have been now I'm dating or
married for now almost 20 years.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.170
And we have went through a lot
of different diets and weight

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.700
loss challenges in our life.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.470
And here's the one thing that we've
learned with each one of those.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.880
The only way we'll be successful
is not after you've went

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.930
out and ate a cheeseburger.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.560
Right.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.850
And you're like, oh, I failed.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.110
It's not giving up.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.610
It's just starting the next.

00:04:18.845 --> 00:04:19.175
Right.

00:04:19.205 --> 00:04:23.375
It's the next mill I'm back on track or
the next day I'm back on track, right?

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:27.365
For most of us when we fell resolutions
or when we fell, whatever thing

00:04:27.365 --> 00:04:32.915
we planned out, we give up and see
that's where we all tend to be with

00:04:32.915 --> 00:04:35.135
resolutions, but we should not give up.

00:04:35.165 --> 00:04:38.315
We should be motivated to start again
and to start again and start again.

00:04:38.315 --> 00:04:41.975
So today's message is going to really talk
about new beginnings and how we start.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.630
New beginnings consistently
and things like that.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.390
So I started just thinking through
some resolutions, um, and the only

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.880
way that we would be successful
at those, this is something that

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.230
would motivate us to accomplish it.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.500
Right.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.020
And so, uh, for me back whenever I
was 23 ish, we had our first daughter

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.330
Peyton and I was 267 pounds decided
to go to the doctor at age 23.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.600
And they said, Hey, you need
some cholesterol medicine.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.160
And like at 23, no way I was
motivated to not get on medicine.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.260
So.

00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:15.495
It was middle of the
summer in Oklahoma, 105.

00:05:15.525 --> 00:05:17.205
I started running at noon.

00:05:17.955 --> 00:05:18.195
Okay.

00:05:18.195 --> 00:05:22.875
At noon, which means I wanted to
have a heat stroke, but my goal was,

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:26.594
I was so fed up and motivated that
I started running and I could only.

00:05:27.315 --> 00:05:28.185
A half a block.

00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:31.815
And then that turned
into six months later.

00:05:32.205 --> 00:05:34.395
I had lost somewhere between
60 pounds and I think it was

00:05:34.395 --> 00:05:35.205
around eight or nine months.

00:05:35.205 --> 00:05:36.825
I'd lost 87 pounds.

00:05:37.185 --> 00:05:38.925
Um, I changed my diet.

00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:40.215
I changed my workout habits.

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:44.355
I started running and my life changed
and yes, I've fluctuated and I'm

00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:45.825
working on going back down again.

00:05:45.825 --> 00:05:50.955
But I would say this, I was motivated
by being aged 23, a new father that

00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:52.034
I wouldn't be around for my daughter.

00:05:52.034 --> 00:05:53.055
So it motivated me.

00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:53.414
Right.

00:05:53.414 --> 00:05:54.105
So that works for.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.840
Um, for some of you, you want to
be motivated to read more books

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.270
because you love knowledge or
you'd love to have that time alone.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.450
Right?

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.770
So you're, what are you motivated by?

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.080
What is it that's going to draw
you into that for some of you

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.730
again, and we're seeing it today.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.710
Nobody's dedication is to be a new year.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.590
Well, you guys are your new year's
resolutions probably do attend church.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.330
Great success.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.990
Number one.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.909
But why are you motivated
to attend church?

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:16.950
Or why are you motivated to grow
in your relationship with Christ?

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.320
It's probably because you see value in it.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.750
And so what we're going
to look at today is.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.640
Is as we set godly resolutions,
we'll see, Paul in this text was

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:33.060
motivated in his ability to have a
good reputation, um, by three things

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.610
by three things, one, the fear of the.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.620
The love of Christ and
the commission of Christ.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.980
And so for him, and just kind of
give you a bit of background on this.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.659
Paul had been accused of using his
ministry for personal gain and also

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:49.200
Paul's, um, Paul was not very wealthy.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.750
Um, but he, he, he actually was like
a tentmaker and he wasn't very tall

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.870
and he wasn't good at his speech and
people kind of criticized him in that.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.120
And so these people that he's
writing to had actually given.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.370
Criticisms, because he was trying to
kind of use, utilize his ministry to get

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.590
a game because there was these guys who
actually look the outward part that we're

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.750
trying to sway people over to their side,
basically, and to stop following Paul.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.410
And so Paul was like,
Hey, look at my life.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:26.880
My life is, uh, basically, uh, its
conduct can prove that it's worthy and,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.440
uh, he begins to share his current.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.710
It's worthy because of these three
things, the fear of the Lord, the love

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.090
of Christ and the commission of Christ.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.480
And so as I began to look into
this and I think we'll look at

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.020
this together, we'll be able to
be motivated by those same things.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.470
Right.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.410
And I'll just encourage you in
this, when it comes to new year's

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.720
resolutions or any kind of resolution.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.100
Um, I think the greatest way to fulfill
it is, is, is four things, right.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.040
Um, and I think I've taught on this
before, but there's four things.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.650
Number one, when it comes to a
resolution or a live change, number

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.020
one, Recognize the need for it.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.580
So once you recognize the need for
it too, it's what do you do about it?

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.610
So for me, if it's losing weight, it's
I need to change my eating habits.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.450
I need to change my exercise.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.390
So that's number two, but the third
and fourth ones, the ones that we

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.460
typically avoid, we know the issue.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.780
We know what to do, but we refuse to
put a timeline when to start it and we

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.970
refuse to invite accountability into it.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.760
We refuse to invite accountability
into it, which means this.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.570
If we fell, nobody knows.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.800
But when we have somebody that's
motivating or encouraging us,

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.270
we're more likely to be successful.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.750
So here's another thing when it comes
to resolutions, set them together.

00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:34.155
Invite people into the process in this.

00:08:34.454 --> 00:08:38.895
So let's read this text second
Corinthians five, starting in verse nine.

00:08:39.525 --> 00:08:44.655
And it says, therefore, whether we are at
home or a way we make it, our aim to be

00:08:44.655 --> 00:08:49.305
pleasing to him for, we must all appear
before the judgment seat of Christ so

00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:53.145
that each may be repaid for what he has
done in the body, whether good or evil.

00:08:53.625 --> 00:08:57.194
And therefore, since we know the
fear of the Lord, we try to persuade.

00:08:58.094 --> 00:09:01.454
What are we, or what
we are is plain to God.

00:09:01.454 --> 00:09:03.675
And I hope also is plain
to your conscience.

00:09:04.515 --> 00:09:09.045
We are not committing ourselves to you
again, but giving you an opportunity to be

00:09:09.045 --> 00:09:15.045
proud of us so that you may have a reply
for those who take pride in our outward

00:09:15.045 --> 00:09:19.035
appearance, rather than have the heart
for, if we are out of our mind, it is for.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.490
If we are in our right mind, it
is for you for the love of Christ.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.390
Compels us.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.170
Since we have reached this
conclusion, if one died for all,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.510
then all died and he died for all.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.810
So that those who live should no
longer live for themselves, but for

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.650
the one who died for them and was.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.300
From now on, then we do not know
anyone from a worldly perspective,

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.420
even if we have known Christ
from a really perspective, yet we

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.100
no longer know him in this way.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.910
Therefore, if anyone is in
Christ, he is a new creation.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.550
The oldest passed away
and see the new hectic.

00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:56.285
Everything is from God who has
reconciled us for himself through

00:09:56.285 --> 00:10:00.425
Christ and has given us the ministry
of reconciliation that is in Christ.

00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:03.695
God was reconciling the world
to himself, not counting

00:10:03.695 --> 00:10:05.165
their trespasses against them.

00:10:05.435 --> 00:10:08.045
And he has committed the
message of reconciliation to us.

00:10:08.465 --> 00:10:13.565
Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ
since God is making his appeal through us.

00:10:13.595 --> 00:10:16.235
We plead on Christ's behalf
to be reconciled to God.

00:10:16.745 --> 00:10:19.835
He has made the one who did
not know sin to be sin for.

00:10:20.675 --> 00:10:24.485
So they in him, we might become
the righteousness of God.

00:10:24.785 --> 00:10:26.885
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:10:26.885 --> 00:10:28.535
We just pray Lord that your word.

00:10:28.745 --> 00:10:32.375
Um, Lord pierces, our hearts and
our lives Lord, and continues to

00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:35.105
guide and direct our lives and
the way that you would have us go.

00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:37.475
And so Lord, we just pray
this in your heavenly name.

00:10:38.045 --> 00:10:38.314
Amen.

00:10:39.575 --> 00:10:41.825
So let me kind of catch you up
on the first couple of verses.

00:10:42.215 --> 00:10:46.715
Why is Paul speaking about, um,
therefore, whether we are at home.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.770
Or a way we make it our
aim to pleasing him.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:54.180
And he had to actually just got
done talking about, um, wanting to

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.810
be present with the Lord and absent
from the body and how we desire that.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.180
So I don't know about you guys over
the last couple of years, there's

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.360
been some moments where I've wanted
to be absent from this body and

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.500
present with the Lord because we know.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.680
Presence with the Lord is peace.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.590
You know, it's, it's safety, it's comfort.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.050
It's no pain, no tears, none of that.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.570
And so there's been those moments
where I can understand that same thing,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.630
but what Paul's basically getting
to is at this point, whether you're

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.160
absent from this body and present
with the Lord or whether you're.

00:11:21.015 --> 00:11:24.525
Today in this earth, we need
to be pleasing to the Lord.

00:11:25.065 --> 00:11:26.475
We need to be pleasing to the Lord.

00:11:26.925 --> 00:11:30.405
And, um, I know this at times
we wonder what does it mean

00:11:30.405 --> 00:11:31.455
to be pleasing to the Lord?

00:11:31.455 --> 00:11:34.215
And so, um, I wanted to ask that question.

00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:35.355
What do you believe?

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:39.555
The reason that we should live in
such a way that pleases the Lord?

00:11:43.775 --> 00:11:48.035
Why should we live in such a way
that, that basically it pleases.

00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:52.955
Because he, what he did
for us on the cross.

00:11:52.955 --> 00:11:55.775
And Paul will even explain that
even further, as, as we look at

00:11:55.775 --> 00:11:58.985
this, he says not only what he
did for us on the cross, but also.

00:11:59.939 --> 00:12:03.390
What is coming for us and we'll see
this in verse 10, where he says this,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.380
he says for, we must appear before the
judgment seat of Christ so that each

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.010
of us may be repaid for what we have
done in the body, whether good or evil.

00:12:11.579 --> 00:12:14.520
And so we make it our aim to please guy,
because of the judgment that's coming.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.530
This are our surgeon
studying about this judgment.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.170
And so there's actually two types
of judgments that are coming.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.020
You'll hear one that's called the
white throne judgment, which is

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.589
the judgment for those who have not
accepted Christ, that will stand before.

00:12:26.365 --> 00:12:30.085
And be repaid for the life that they
lived, basically a sinful life, right.

00:12:30.115 --> 00:12:31.435
Separation from God forever.

00:12:31.765 --> 00:12:33.595
But this judgment is actually
a different judgment.

00:12:33.595 --> 00:12:38.605
He's actually speaking to believers, those
who will stand before God and be able to

00:12:38.755 --> 00:12:43.345
lay down their works and say, Hey God,
based upon my commitment, my relationship

00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:46.735
with you, here's how I've lived and
will be rewarded based upon that.

00:12:47.065 --> 00:12:51.565
And I don't know about you guys as, as a
kid, um, as, even as an adult, sometimes I

00:12:51.685 --> 00:12:54.205
tend to like rewards anybody like rewards.

00:12:54.205 --> 00:12:55.015
I mean, especially a little bit.

00:12:56.225 --> 00:12:57.185
I know I can't have it.

00:12:57.185 --> 00:12:57.545
Sorry.

00:12:57.725 --> 00:12:58.865
I can't have any of those anymore.

00:12:58.895 --> 00:12:59.615
It's new years, right?

00:12:59.615 --> 00:13:00.425
It's the resolution.

00:13:00.455 --> 00:13:01.265
No little Debbies.

00:13:02.225 --> 00:13:07.115
Um, but I like rewards and I
also started thinking about this.

00:13:07.115 --> 00:13:12.245
I also like to see people pleased with the
activity in which I live or how I live.

00:13:12.245 --> 00:13:13.175
Is anybody ever liked that?

00:13:13.175 --> 00:13:15.575
Where you, especially as a teacher's
pet, you want to be the one that

00:13:15.605 --> 00:13:16.745
they're like, oh, great job.

00:13:16.955 --> 00:13:17.915
Good job listening.

00:13:18.005 --> 00:13:19.055
I don't know if anybody's like that.

00:13:19.055 --> 00:13:19.325
Right.

00:13:19.595 --> 00:13:20.735
I'll give you an adult.

00:13:21.735 --> 00:13:24.824
I like doing things around the
house where Brittany is going to

00:13:24.824 --> 00:13:27.765
actually notice and should be like,
oh honey, thanks for doing that.

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:28.125
Right.

00:13:28.515 --> 00:13:33.344
There's something inside me that
enjoys receiving a compliment or

00:13:33.344 --> 00:13:35.805
a reward, words of affirmation.

00:13:35.805 --> 00:13:36.165
Right.

00:13:36.405 --> 00:13:37.485
That could be your love language.

00:13:38.295 --> 00:13:44.295
So as we look at this, we see,
um, Paul is saying we should make

00:13:44.295 --> 00:13:48.675
it our aim to please God, because
one day we'll stand before him.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.590
Basically giving back to him, all
the things that we did for him and

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.120
he'll, we'll receive a reward for him.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.400
And I started thinking about this.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.660
It's interesting, as we begin to think
about this judgment is for those who

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:05.760
have given your life to Christ, what
should motivate you to set godly

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.940
resolutions this year so that you live
in such a way that pleases the Lord?

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.410
What should motivate you?

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:15.090
Well, what should motivate you
is giving praise and honor back

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.800
to the one who as Brittany.

00:14:17.535 --> 00:14:19.965
Died for you, gave you a new life.

00:14:20.505 --> 00:14:24.225
And so I think about this over and
over again is how we can be motivated.

00:14:24.375 --> 00:14:26.865
And if you guys remember me kind
of teaching on this before is

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:29.985
what's the difference between
motivation and inspiration.

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:31.275
This is a church, right?

00:14:31.275 --> 00:14:34.785
We're inspiring hope
church, but motivation is an

00:14:34.814 --> 00:14:37.755
outward basically drawing.

00:14:37.785 --> 00:14:42.255
So this, you guys go to work because
you know, you're going to get paid.

00:14:42.855 --> 00:14:46.245
So you have an outward motivation, but
inspiration is an inward motivation.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:47.370
Right.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.780
It's an inward inspiration.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.040
It means drawing out of you.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.060
What's already inside of you.

00:14:51.449 --> 00:14:52.859
So let me go back to this.

00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:56.729
It, Paul speaking directly to believers at
this moment, he's speaking to us and he's

00:14:56.729 --> 00:15:03.300
saying, Hey, whatever you do, whatever
you are basically sending resolutions this

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.120
year to do may be pleasing to the Lord.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.530
What's your motivation?

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.489
What's your inspiration.

00:15:08.819 --> 00:15:09.479
It's too.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.620
Be pleasing to the Lord and know
that at the end of your life,

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.800
you'll receive a reward for what
you've done, what you've done.

00:15:17.699 --> 00:15:21.780
And so I know, um, again, it's, it's,
it's we think, well, why should we

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:25.439
be motivated to do some of these
things, but it is because of what

00:15:25.439 --> 00:15:29.280
God has done for us, um, to be molded
for made it motivated for that.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.449
So let's look at verses 11 through
13, where it says this in 11, it

00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:37.680
says, therefore, since we know the
fear of the Lord, we try to persuade.

00:15:38.925 --> 00:15:40.515
And so I stopped there and
started thinking about this.

00:15:40.515 --> 00:15:44.025
If we know the fear of the Lord, we
know number one, if you know Christ,

00:15:44.025 --> 00:15:47.805
the fear of the Lord is, is not
something that scares me, but I look

00:15:47.805 --> 00:15:48.915
at it as something as authority.

00:15:49.005 --> 00:15:52.185
And so anybody ever have
parents that, that punish them.

00:15:53.325 --> 00:15:53.685
Okay.

00:15:54.045 --> 00:15:56.925
Anybody ever had parents that would
tell you that this is going to

00:15:56.925 --> 00:15:58.275
hurt me worse than it hurts you.

00:15:59.415 --> 00:15:59.625
Okay.

00:15:59.685 --> 00:16:02.175
Anybody now as a parent ever
said that to your child.

00:16:03.885 --> 00:16:04.365
Okay.

00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:05.145
Why.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.900
Because you desire for your kids
to respect you and you punish

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.870
them because they usually aren't
respecting your authority.

00:16:13.709 --> 00:16:17.100
So you want your kids to have a
healthy fear of you, your authority,

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.709
but it's actually truly love.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.250
Isn't it it's truly love in which
you're trying to show your child.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.800
And so, as we look at this, we are
motivated, not just because of ourselves

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.850
wanting to receive a reward, we're
motivated because we want others.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.329
Right?

00:16:33.329 --> 00:16:34.800
We want to persuade others.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.530
To experience God's love and really
his purpose for them to be saved.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.120
And so he goes on and says, what are we,
uh, us is what we are is plain to God.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.939
And hope is also plain to your conscience.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.699
We're not committing ourselves to
you again, or giving you opportunity

00:16:50.699 --> 00:16:52.350
to be proud of us so that you may.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.160
Have a reply for those who take
pride in their outward appearance

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:56.940
rather than their heart.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.460
And again, he's speaking to those
who are trying to do the outward

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.310
appearance and say, Hey, follow
us rather than following Paul.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.319
And so Paul is kind of
speaking directly to them.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.620
Um, but he says for if we are
out of our mind, it is for God.

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.510
And if we're in our right
mind, it is for you.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:15.000
And, um, and so as he talks about this,
for someone who doesn't know Christ.

00:17:15.645 --> 00:17:16.994
Or hasn't given their life to him.

00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:19.935
They don't know about the judgment
that's coming to them again.

00:17:19.935 --> 00:17:20.895
This is the second judgment.

00:17:20.895 --> 00:17:22.845
When we think about this, the second
judgment that's coming to them.

00:17:22.845 --> 00:17:26.325
And so we should be persuaded
to tell other people about that.

00:17:27.105 --> 00:17:29.835
And then I started thinking with,
with Paul here, he understands

00:17:29.835 --> 00:17:33.764
the seriousness of him living his
life out pure and above reproach.

00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:36.495
And that's why he didn't fear judgment.

00:17:37.455 --> 00:17:41.685
But for those of us, um,
Who may fear judgment.

00:17:41.745 --> 00:17:45.795
And what I mean by that is we may fear
what comes to us at the end of our lives.

00:17:46.545 --> 00:17:50.805
Or maybe we fear that for other
people, how do we respond?

00:17:51.345 --> 00:17:54.375
And we should be motivated again,
when we think about this, how do we

00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:58.965
get motivated to actually set godly
resolutions has, because we understand

00:17:58.965 --> 00:18:04.455
the fear of the Lord and we're persuaded
to make sure that other people know.

00:18:05.175 --> 00:18:08.025
So to make a godly resolution is to
say, Hey God, I don't just want to be.

00:18:09.325 --> 00:18:15.535
Um, and that's a great one go for it,
but I want to be so persuaded that

00:18:15.585 --> 00:18:18.685
others know, not only that it can,
we understand the fear, but that fear

00:18:18.685 --> 00:18:22.105
is really an understanding of who God
is and his authority in your life,

00:18:22.375 --> 00:18:26.575
and really, even more so the love
that he gives us in his life as well.

00:18:27.385 --> 00:18:30.715
And I think about this each day, as
a believer, when he talks about we're

00:18:30.715 --> 00:18:31.975
going to receive rewards, right.

00:18:32.005 --> 00:18:34.975
Or we will not receive a
rewards based on how we lived.

00:18:35.815 --> 00:18:37.705
We'll be held accountable to how we live.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.630
And, uh, I think that's something
that is challenging to me that

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.500
I'm going to be held accountable.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:43.890
Right.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.760
Too many times.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.460
I hear too many people say this
well, I've given my life to Christ.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.110
You ask somebody to say this
question, Hey, do you have

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.770
a relationship with Jesus?

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:50.940
You have given my life to Christ.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:51.660
Yeah.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.340
So, so what's life look like right now?

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.270
Oh, no, not much.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.630
I mean, I'm just waiting for heaven
and it's like, do you, do you know,

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:01.260
like the rest of your life, you're
held accountable to how you live.

00:19:02.085 --> 00:19:05.294
Like shouldn't, you want to
live it for the glory of God.

00:19:05.294 --> 00:19:09.345
And for again, when we, as we talked
about earlier, um, so that others may

00:19:09.345 --> 00:19:11.655
know him, um, and sometimes we miss that.

00:19:11.655 --> 00:19:15.314
So we're going to be held
accountable as an unbeliever, right?

00:19:15.345 --> 00:19:17.655
If we don't know Christ or as a believer.

00:19:17.985 --> 00:19:22.875
So if you wonder, um, as a believer,
should I care how I live in life?

00:19:22.905 --> 00:19:23.595
Absolutely.

00:19:24.014 --> 00:19:24.825
And I heard this statement.

00:19:24.825 --> 00:19:25.695
It actually rang true.

00:19:25.695 --> 00:19:25.935
Really?

00:19:25.935 --> 00:19:27.975
To me heard the statement
from an unbeliever.

00:19:28.725 --> 00:19:30.705
He said this, I want to
be a zealous for God.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.420
As I was for the devil.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.810
So he wants to be a zealous for
God as he was for the devil.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.700
I think about my life before Christ.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.750
I was pretty gung ho about my life
before Christ and the moment I gave

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:47.190
my life to Christ, I want it to be
just as zealous the opposite way.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.580
So I started doing things that were fun.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.580
I started doing things that were
encouraging, things that were basically

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.700
life-changing in just a positive.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.760
And I just, again, that's a challenge
for us, as we say, godly resolutions.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.850
Do you realize that that
your life is that important?

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.780
Not only for yourself, but for
someone else, for someone else.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.350
And I started thinking about this,
someone is waiting for you on the other

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.960
side of your godly resolution, right.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.670
And your success and accomplishing it.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.100
And so luckily when you
think about accomplished.

00:20:19.755 --> 00:20:22.785
Godly resolutions is you're
not on your own, right?

00:20:22.785 --> 00:20:24.945
This is where the body of
Christ is here to help you.

00:20:25.365 --> 00:20:29.145
This is where the spirit of God
promises to guide and direct you in it.

00:20:29.355 --> 00:20:32.805
So what should motivate us and guide
us to make resolutions this year?

00:20:32.805 --> 00:20:34.275
Number one is the fear of the Lord, right?

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:37.155
The judgment that we'll receive
at the end of our lives, whether

00:20:37.155 --> 00:20:38.175
what we've done good or bad.

00:20:38.865 --> 00:20:43.275
Um, or as an unbeliever, um, obviously
not coming in our life stem, but then the

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:47.145
second one, and this is the one I think
that just reminds me more and more as we

00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:48.825
should be motivated by the love of Christ.

00:20:48.825 --> 00:20:53.535
And this is verse 14, it says for
the love of Christ compels us.

00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:57.345
Since we have reached this conclusion,
if one died for all, then all died

00:20:58.095 --> 00:21:00.405
and if all died or if he died for all.

00:21:00.405 --> 00:21:03.705
So that those who live should no
longer live for themselves, but the

00:21:03.705 --> 00:21:06.345
one who died for them was raised
and that gets really confused.

00:21:06.355 --> 00:21:07.355
And we'll kind of break that down.

00:21:08.755 --> 00:21:10.675
How does love and fear work together.

00:21:11.275 --> 00:21:12.085
He has ever think about that.

00:21:12.085 --> 00:21:13.495
How does love and fear work together?

00:21:14.215 --> 00:21:16.945
And I started thinking back to
that example about our parents.

00:21:17.815 --> 00:21:21.385
It's, it's important to have a
healthy fear of our parents, meaning

00:21:21.385 --> 00:21:22.645
they're respecting their authority.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.169
But their love is just as important.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.740
So that can come from a positive
direction where they work together.

00:21:29.639 --> 00:21:32.429
And so the love of Christ
motivates us right?

00:21:32.429 --> 00:21:37.020
Based on what he did on the cross in
John first, John four 19 says this we'd

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.020
love him because he first loved us.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.120
So we're compelled to make godly
resolutions because God first loved

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.000
us and he gives us this new life.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.290
And so I talked about this being a
message of new beginnings, new beginnings.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.530
Um, it's a new life and it's a new year.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.610
It's an opportunity to be
a new person in Christ.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.220
And that may be, I've already
given my life to Christ 10 years

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.230
ago, but you can be new today.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:09.540
Use it to kind of say, Hey,
20, 21 was not my best life.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.250
I did not live up to the standards.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.070
Maybe I should have, but it's
a new day and it's a new year

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.390
and it's a new opportunity.

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:17.490
And what motivates you?

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.990
Not only the fear of God, but the
love of Christ, the love of Christ.

00:22:23.145 --> 00:22:24.645
And I always think about this as well.

00:22:24.735 --> 00:22:26.985
And I, and you guys hear me say
this, this is, I spend a lot of time

00:22:26.985 --> 00:22:28.245
just thinking through these things.

00:22:29.685 --> 00:22:34.905
How many of y'all when you see somebody
wearing either, um, their, their military

00:22:34.905 --> 00:22:38.175
gear or, uh, you know, veterans hat,
do you ever stop and say, thank you

00:22:38.175 --> 00:22:39.764
for your service, anybody do that?

00:22:40.155 --> 00:22:41.774
I tend to do that more and more.

00:22:42.225 --> 00:22:45.075
Um, and the reason why is I
respect their willingness to

00:22:45.075 --> 00:22:47.745
sacrifice their lives for our.

00:22:49.695 --> 00:22:51.735
Well, why do we do that?

00:22:51.735 --> 00:22:55.035
Well, because we recognize the
importance of what they do.

00:22:55.815 --> 00:23:01.155
Jesus sacrificed his life so
that you would be free from sin

00:23:01.875 --> 00:23:03.015
and live in eternity with him.

00:23:04.545 --> 00:23:13.365
I'm compelled by his love to be thankful
and to make commitments this year to

00:23:13.365 --> 00:23:15.615
live a life that's honoring to him.

00:23:15.645 --> 00:23:15.975
Right.

00:23:16.005 --> 00:23:16.515
That's honoring.

00:23:17.745 --> 00:23:22.005
And so here's what Paul describes and
just kind of walk through this first 14.

00:23:22.395 --> 00:23:25.875
Again, he says this, he says for
the love of Christ compels us.

00:23:25.875 --> 00:23:29.625
Since we have reached this conclusion,
if one died for all, then all died.

00:23:29.685 --> 00:23:31.005
What the heck does that mean?

00:23:31.245 --> 00:23:32.175
What the heck does that mean?

00:23:32.865 --> 00:23:33.765
Here's what it means.

00:23:33.765 --> 00:23:38.085
It says when Christ died on the cross,
our old life died along with him.

00:23:38.505 --> 00:23:42.045
Our old life died along with him,
which means this, our old life of sin,

00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:44.325
which means that a sin nature died.

00:23:44.955 --> 00:23:47.535
Is what if I haven't given
my life to Christ that subs?

00:23:47.715 --> 00:23:48.045
Yes.

00:23:48.045 --> 00:23:51.225
But what he's saying is he's
conquered it, he's defeated it.

00:23:51.615 --> 00:23:53.145
And we had the ability to accept it.

00:23:53.145 --> 00:23:54.855
It does not have control of risks today.

00:23:55.425 --> 00:23:58.755
We allow to have control over
us, but he says it does not

00:23:59.205 --> 00:24:00.255
because he's defeated him.

00:24:00.315 --> 00:24:01.935
And Galatians two 20 reminds me of this.

00:24:01.935 --> 00:24:03.585
I have been crucified with Christ.

00:24:04.095 --> 00:24:07.635
I no longer live, but Christ
lives in me and the life.

00:24:07.635 --> 00:24:08.685
I now live in the body.

00:24:08.685 --> 00:24:11.985
I live by faith in the son of God
who loved me and gave himself.

00:24:13.455 --> 00:24:19.075
And so then it says if he died, Um,
for all so that those who live should

00:24:19.075 --> 00:24:23.035
no longer live for themselves, but the
one who died for him and was raised.

00:24:23.425 --> 00:24:25.014
And so was Christ was
raised from the dead.

00:24:25.014 --> 00:24:27.565
He gave us a new life to live.

00:24:27.745 --> 00:24:32.935
Not only do we not, uh, we died as a, as
our old life, but we now have a new life.

00:24:33.115 --> 00:24:37.315
And we see that in, in one of my favorite
verses segment, the it's five 17.

00:24:37.735 --> 00:24:40.675
He says, therefore, if anyone is
in Christ, he is a new creation.

00:24:40.915 --> 00:24:44.125
The oldest passed away
and see the new has.

00:24:45.815 --> 00:24:47.765
I think about that verse a lot.

00:24:48.455 --> 00:24:52.475
And I look at it and go if, if we're
in Christ, the oldest passed away.

00:24:53.015 --> 00:24:57.395
So for some of you seriously,
you, you need to give up the old

00:24:57.395 --> 00:24:59.615
of 20, 21, or maybe just the old.

00:24:59.615 --> 00:25:01.955
And this is not saying your memories
and those things are important, but

00:25:02.285 --> 00:25:06.365
the old life, the old way of living,
it's not valuable for any more crisis

00:25:06.365 --> 00:25:09.935
already defeated that, that life
that's just not valuable for you more.

00:25:09.935 --> 00:25:11.255
And he's given you a new life.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.240
And if you've given your life to Christ
in the past, and maybe this is just a time

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.920
for you to say, I need a new commitment.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.870
I need a fresh start, man.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.790
God is offering that test today.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.420
And this new start is not just
a, and we talk about this a lot.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.550
It's not just saying no
to sin too many times.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:27.960
Churches preach, say no to sin.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.680
Say no to sin.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:30.870
No it's saying yes to Jesus.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:35.880
If you say yes to Jesus more than
you say no to sin noticing happens

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.010
all the time, but I'm still people.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.120
Listen, if you consistently say notice.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:44.040
It's like staring at a cheesecake and
saying, donated, donate it, donate it.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:45.600
What's going to happen.

00:25:45.899 --> 00:25:47.280
I'm going to take a
bite of that cheesecake.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.480
But if I say yes to Jesus, the
cheesecake's left here and I'm

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.190
walking that way towards Jesus.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.450
And I'm saying yes to Jesus.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.470
I don't even see the cheesecake.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.020
I don't even smell it anymore
because I'm saying yes to Jesus.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.899
And that's what I love about this first.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.250
The love of Christ compels
us to walk in a new light.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:06.540
Right.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:12.870
The fear of the Lord compels us to walk
in a new life and to receive the mercy

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:15.150
and grace and love that he has for us.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.760
Freedom is not holding
you down by your past.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:24.700
I love that freedom does not
hold you down by your past.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.030
Right.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.890
We are new in 2022 can
be a new life for you.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:33.960
And for me, So Christ's love
for us, allows us to experience

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.639
a new life of new beginnings.

00:26:35.639 --> 00:26:35.909
Right?

00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:38.070
We can view our life through
the lenses of eternity.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.780
We can view everyone around us.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:43.290
The way that Christ desires
is to even those who struggle.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.370
We can admit it, right.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.620
We can live free by admitting
our struggles and saying,

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.399
Hey, we're not perfect.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.159
I'll tell you I'm not perfect at all.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.740
I was having a conversation
this past week in Oklahoma.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.720
And, uh, it's just this reminder
that too many times we think

00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.280
we have to live a perfect life.

00:27:00.435 --> 00:27:04.425
And it's like, no Christ lived the
perfect life so that we know that we

00:27:04.425 --> 00:27:06.915
won't and we can cling on to that.

00:27:06.915 --> 00:27:09.915
Now it doesn't mean we just keep living
them perfect life because, oh, we're good.

00:27:10.215 --> 00:27:12.584
But it means that don't,
don't beat yourself up.

00:27:12.645 --> 00:27:15.584
If you're not hitting the mark,
you know, this is why every day can

00:27:15.584 --> 00:27:19.185
be new to us and we can continue
to strive to reflect Christ.

00:27:19.965 --> 00:27:23.625
So Christ loves should compel and
motivate us to make resolutions this

00:27:23.625 --> 00:27:26.594
year, the reflect the new light that
we have experienced through Christ.

00:27:27.285 --> 00:27:27.585
Right.

00:27:27.585 --> 00:27:30.945
So it should motivate us through the
fear of the Lord, the love of Christ.

00:27:30.945 --> 00:27:32.625
And the last one is the
commission of Christ.

00:27:33.375 --> 00:27:38.445
Um, anybody, anybody like being a part
of something bigger than themselves?

00:27:38.535 --> 00:27:39.315
Like a mission?

00:27:39.975 --> 00:27:43.335
I mean, honestly, isn't that what we are
as a church, like inspiring hope churches

00:27:43.635 --> 00:27:45.315
is something bigger than an individual.

00:27:45.825 --> 00:27:50.025
We are working together to reach our
city for the love of Christ, right.

00:27:50.025 --> 00:27:54.195
To, to reach them, to, to know
Christ and to, to live a life

00:27:54.195 --> 00:27:55.335
that is fulfilling, right.

00:27:55.335 --> 00:27:55.995
This side of heaven.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.460
And so we are working together to do that.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.690
We'll see Paul again.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.330
And, and so you guys know
I'm not just twisting this.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.200
Paul is literally saying these are
the things I use every day to have a

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.830
life that is reflecting Christ, right?

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:15.180
So he fears the Lord and he lets
the love of Christ, motivate him to

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.980
live a life worthy of the gospel.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.320
And he lets this mission drive him.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.680
So it's the same thing for
us, the commission of Christ.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.850
And so let's look at verses 18 through 20.

00:28:26.145 --> 00:28:31.065
It says this, everything is from
God who has reconciled us to himself

00:28:31.095 --> 00:28:33.915
through Christ and has given us
the ministry of reconciliation.

00:28:34.575 --> 00:28:37.815
You know, if, if something said in the
Bible, once, you know, especially in

00:28:37.815 --> 00:28:40.425
the verses that you're reading, it's
important, but let's keep on reading.

00:28:40.815 --> 00:28:42.345
This is, that is in Christ.

00:28:42.345 --> 00:28:45.315
God was reconciling the world
to himself, not counting

00:28:45.315 --> 00:28:46.635
their trespasses against them.

00:28:46.815 --> 00:28:49.605
And he has committed the
message of reconciliation to us.

00:28:50.055 --> 00:28:51.375
Hey, guess what is he committed to us?

00:28:53.955 --> 00:28:55.695
The message of reconciliation.

00:28:56.445 --> 00:29:02.675
God has given us commission to give
this message of reconciliation.

00:29:02.675 --> 00:29:03.695
What is reconciliation?

00:29:03.695 --> 00:29:04.955
That means something's broken.

00:29:05.705 --> 00:29:11.135
A relationship is broken and the message
that we have can heal that relationship.

00:29:11.705 --> 00:29:13.805
There is a God in heaven that loves you.

00:29:15.065 --> 00:29:18.845
He loves you, and you may have given
your life to him 10 years ago, 20 years.

00:29:19.845 --> 00:29:22.965
And your, your relationship can
still at times be broken by just the

00:29:22.965 --> 00:29:25.995
way that you've lived and maybe you
haven't ever given your life to Christ.

00:29:25.995 --> 00:29:29.865
And you may be wondering, can that
relationship be mended and reconciled?

00:29:30.195 --> 00:29:31.065
Absolutely.

00:29:31.215 --> 00:29:32.145
100%.

00:29:32.325 --> 00:29:33.015
How do you know?

00:29:33.435 --> 00:29:36.315
Because the Bible clearly says that
he has given those who've given

00:29:36.315 --> 00:29:42.005
their lives to him, that new life to
minister by getting this message of.

00:29:42.855 --> 00:29:46.545
That Christ came to this
world, lived a perfect life.

00:29:46.605 --> 00:29:50.865
It wasn't an easy life, but a perfect life
and died on a cross for our sin so that we

00:29:50.865 --> 00:29:53.625
can accept him and receive the new life.

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:53.835
Right.

00:29:53.835 --> 00:29:54.855
The oldest passed away.

00:29:54.855 --> 00:30:00.795
The new has come and he's given us
this commission with this message

00:30:01.485 --> 00:30:05.985
to not just sit and come to church
every Sunday and say, checkbox.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:07.860
I made it right.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.550
I made it to heaven.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.850
I'm going to make it to heaven because
I know he's, he's given us this message

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:17.580
for us to take with this as we go,
your most important mission starts.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.710
The moment you leave out of
this, this building today.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:24.720
And when you come back, it's
a way to share with others,

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.220
how that has worked out.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.990
And some, some weeks
we're going to nail it.

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:31.620
We're going to be like, Hey, I got
to share the, what, the ministry

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.880
of reconciliation with somebody.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:35.590
And some weeks you're gonna come
back and say, you know, a flat out.

00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:38.804
And this is a place to go,
okay, how do we work on it?

00:30:39.465 --> 00:30:43.995
And it's recognizing where we are
understanding our next step setting.

00:30:43.995 --> 00:30:46.125
The timeline have been held accountable.

00:30:46.125 --> 00:30:46.725
That's the church.

00:30:46.725 --> 00:30:47.985
Is that not the church?

00:30:48.044 --> 00:30:48.885
It is the church.

00:30:50.685 --> 00:30:53.925
So we have not been saved
just from something.

00:30:53.925 --> 00:30:54.225
Right.

00:30:54.254 --> 00:30:55.784
But we've been saved to something.

00:30:56.655 --> 00:31:00.195
And so the calling and commission on
our life from Christ should motivate us

00:31:01.094 --> 00:31:02.985
and guide us in our making resolutions.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:08.500
There is somebody out there this year,
guys, there's somebody out there waiting

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:16.360
on you, waiting on you to say yes to
Jesus, to make godly resolutions and to

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.740
say I'm going to be different this year.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:22.360
I believe every year that I've given
my life to Christ, maybe not every year

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:28.390
by I wrote down resolutions, but I have
thought through things and said, okay,

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:29.920
these are areas I want to be better at.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.570
And sometimes it was
reading the Bible through.

00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:33.615
And sometimes I made it.

00:31:33.615 --> 00:31:37.725
And if you're anything like me about
March, you've pushed ketchup way too

00:31:37.725 --> 00:31:39.195
many times, you just cancel the plan.

00:31:39.615 --> 00:31:39.975
Okay.

00:31:40.425 --> 00:31:42.495
But then there's been years where I've
made it to the whole Bible and it's

00:31:42.495 --> 00:31:45.285
just blown my mind to how big God is.

00:31:45.675 --> 00:31:48.075
There's been years where
it's been health challenges.

00:31:48.075 --> 00:31:51.465
There's been years where
it's been sharing my faith.

00:31:51.495 --> 00:31:56.055
There's been years where it's just been
saying yes to Jesus, any time I was asked

00:31:56.055 --> 00:31:58.155
to, but I'll say this I'm a different.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:01.910
Because of the fear of the
Lord, I'm a different person

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:02.840
because of the love of Christ.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:07.280
And I'm a different person because of the
commission that God's given me a different

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.580
person, not just because of those things,
I'm a different person because I said yes,

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:15.890
because I accepted those things because I
began to live those things out perfectly.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.420
No, no.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.620
Cause if you want to find a perfect
person and a perfect church, you're never

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:26.680
going to find it this side of heaven,
but I'm thankful there was a perfect.

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:33.630
Who sent his son Jesus to live a perfect
life that I can lean on and say, thank

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.330
you, Lord, for your grace and your
mercy, that you can take my place.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.330
When I don't meet the mark,
I don't meet that mark.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.720
So reconciliation was
accomplished on the cross, right.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:47.490
But too many of us try to reconcile
ourselves back to God by our works.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.600
You'll never work yourself to
heaven, tri and you're going

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.130
to work yourself to death.

00:32:56.189 --> 00:32:57.449
And then one day you're going to go.

00:32:57.629 --> 00:32:58.590
I missed that.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:02.399
All it took was just saying yes and
accepting what God's done for us.

00:33:04.169 --> 00:33:08.250
So again, the ministry of
reconciliation God's listed us

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.330
and he says this in verse 29.

00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:13.649
I love this, this, therefore, we
are ambassadors for Christ since

00:33:13.649 --> 00:33:14.939
God is making his appeal through us.

00:33:14.939 --> 00:33:18.689
We plead on Christ's behalf
to be reconciled to God.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.689
I started thinking about that as well.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.030
Ambassadors guys, that's a big time.

00:33:24.945 --> 00:33:28.784
You see this a lot of times in our
government to be an ambassador is an

00:33:28.784 --> 00:33:34.064
honorable thing to be a representative to
another country for really our country.

00:33:34.064 --> 00:33:34.334
Right.

00:33:34.334 --> 00:33:37.784
So think about for Christ, if we're
representative Christ to the world.

00:33:38.175 --> 00:33:43.245
And he says not just to share the message,
but he says, we plead, why do we plead?

00:33:43.425 --> 00:33:47.235
Because we also understand
that the judgment is coming

00:33:47.235 --> 00:33:48.945
for every single person when.

00:33:49.965 --> 00:33:50.685
And I would even say this.

00:33:50.685 --> 00:33:53.985
We plead to those who have given the
lives to Christ because we understand

00:33:53.985 --> 00:33:57.285
judgments coming to those who don't
live their lives worthy to gun.

00:33:57.705 --> 00:34:01.725
We, I want to go before God and
say, I've lived my life out for you.

00:34:02.175 --> 00:34:04.365
Here are the things in
which I have done for you.

00:34:04.365 --> 00:34:08.715
Not that justify me, but that
says my appreciation to them

00:34:09.885 --> 00:34:12.975
is for us to not do anything.

00:34:12.975 --> 00:34:14.835
This side of heaven, after
we get our lives to Christ.

00:34:16.295 --> 00:34:19.444
It's almost like somebody's
giving us a million bucks.

00:34:19.745 --> 00:34:23.705
Somebody's saving our life
and us never saying thank you.

00:34:24.304 --> 00:34:28.625
Never, never doing anything to
show our appreciation back to them.

00:34:28.654 --> 00:34:31.025
And those are minor things
compared to what God's done for us.

00:34:31.714 --> 00:34:35.464
So as we kind of conclude today's
message and just finish up, I want

00:34:35.464 --> 00:34:36.995
to kind of summarize this again.

00:34:38.175 --> 00:34:42.105
We see how Paul was motivated to make
his sure his ministry and his life was

00:34:42.105 --> 00:34:46.425
pure and above reproach, he made sure
his life in his ministry was pure and

00:34:46.425 --> 00:34:49.995
above reproach because through again,
the fear of the Lord, the love of

00:34:49.995 --> 00:34:53.895
Christ and the commission of Christ,
but what's the take home for us, right?

00:34:54.345 --> 00:34:55.545
What's the take home for us.

00:34:56.175 --> 00:35:01.455
We can use those same things to motivate
us and our resolutions, whatever you go

00:35:01.455 --> 00:35:03.885
home today, and you may write it down
and you may think through whatever.

00:35:04.575 --> 00:35:09.915
How do you make sure that you make
the most of 20, 22 is by looking at

00:35:09.915 --> 00:35:13.995
these same things loud, the fear of
the Lord to motivate you, to make godly

00:35:13.995 --> 00:35:18.375
resolutions, a lot of the love of Christ
and what he has done for you, motivate

00:35:18.375 --> 00:35:21.975
you to make godly resolutions, allow
the commission of Christ that he's given

00:35:21.975 --> 00:35:24.734
to no one else, but us in this room.

00:35:25.004 --> 00:35:29.294
And so you may ask this question, but
can't, can't he do it and can't he do it.

00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:30.384
And if they do it, don't.

00:35:31.575 --> 00:35:35.115
Now imagine a football team saying,
Hey, the kickers and the only one

00:35:35.115 --> 00:35:36.435
that's going to win this football game.

00:35:36.925 --> 00:35:38.175
The rest of us are going
to sit on the sidelines.

00:35:38.175 --> 00:35:39.705
We'd laugh right now.

00:35:39.705 --> 00:35:40.845
They all got to work together.

00:35:40.845 --> 00:35:45.255
We all got to work together to take this
message of reconciliation to the world.

00:35:46.515 --> 00:35:49.155
So you may have not ever even
thought of resolutions as a big deal.

00:35:49.185 --> 00:35:50.745
Maybe you just avoid them altogether.

00:35:50.775 --> 00:35:51.135
Right?

00:35:52.155 --> 00:35:56.655
But these commitments are important
for us to make not only every new

00:35:56.655 --> 00:35:58.335
year, but every day to the Lord.

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:01.740
So a couple of things for you to
think through as we have the seven

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.740
visitation, what's the purpose of
imitation it's for us to just take time

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.600
to ask God, God, what'd you teach me.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:10.230
Um, if you're anything like me, I sat
here listening to myself, probably

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.520
about fell asleep while I was preaching.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:16.470
So that may be where you are, but for the
rest of you, maybe you're thinking, okay,

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.780
God, what is it that you would want me?

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:24.000
One thing that you would want me to
focus on this year for some of you, it

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.410
could just be a relationship with Jesus.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.600
I don't know if you've
given your life to Jesus.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.720
I don't even know if you have
questions about what it means

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.740
to give your life to Jesus.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:36.570
And if you do, please,
please, I compel you.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:42.210
I urge you to come talk with me
during, during this time of the song.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:42.990
I'll be in the back.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.610
But even after that, I'll be
at the next type of table.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.910
Let's talk about what that means to
take a next step to follow Jesus.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:51.240
Maybe it's just answering a few
more questions for some of you.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.920
It could be meaning
giving your life to him.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.470
What does it mean to
give your life to Jesus?

00:36:56.235 --> 00:36:58.305
What's that going to change for 2022.

00:36:58.395 --> 00:37:02.445
I'll tell you this, the weight and the
burdens maybe that you have in your life

00:37:02.475 --> 00:37:07.455
will be removed, that you'll receive hope
and mercy and grace and forgiveness for

00:37:07.455 --> 00:37:08.775
anything and everything you've ever done.

00:37:09.465 --> 00:37:10.785
You may say, well, I don't need that.

00:37:10.785 --> 00:37:11.445
I'm a good person.

00:37:11.445 --> 00:37:12.015
Okay, great.

00:37:12.045 --> 00:37:16.455
Maybe you are a good person, but
then you're missing out on one.

00:37:16.455 --> 00:37:20.055
The opportunity that God gives
you, not just to be a good person.

00:37:20.625 --> 00:37:21.075
That's not good.

00:37:21.075 --> 00:37:21.645
It's called to speak.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.670
It's called us into a
relationship with him.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:27.819
And as we grow in that relationship and
the more we know God, the more that we

00:37:27.819 --> 00:37:32.590
recognize we are missing the greatest
part, the greatest part of our life, this

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:35.380
side of heaven is to have a relationship
with the God that created you.

00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.880
I don't know about you guys.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.420
I want that.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.299
I want that we're missing
the greatest part.

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:43.299
When we refuse to have a relationship
with the God that created us.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.950
And as we get to know that God will
realize how good we're not and how

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.990
much better we could be through.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:54.569
But there's some of you that's already
given your life to Christ and you're

00:37:54.569 --> 00:37:56.670
saying, what is 2022 mean to me?

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:02.759
I'm just telling you guys, please,
please commit to being a part of

00:38:02.759 --> 00:38:03.990
the ministry of reconciliation.

00:38:05.339 --> 00:38:09.750
Be a part of what inspiring
hope aspires to be, to inspire

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:11.940
people, to discover hope in Jesus.

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.839
And they extended version of
that is to inspire people, to

00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:18.900
discover their purpose in life,
through a relationship with Jesus.

00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:22.560
I believe every person in this room,
I believe every person in this city

00:38:22.859 --> 00:38:27.660
has a purpose to define from God
that is God is waiting for you.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.049
And for those to accept it
and begin to live it out.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:36.210
And when you do, when you do it may
not mean you move from Oklahoma.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:41.880
It could just mean you go from your front
door to your neighbor's front door and

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.680
you knock on it and you bring them a meal.

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:46.590
It may mean at your job.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.130
You actually have conversations
with people and you ask

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:50.910
how you can pray for them.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:58.620
It may be you just living your life
out for Christ in such a way that

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:03.990
people ask how, how could you live
in this situation and have this

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.500
joy again, joy is not based upon.

00:39:06.585 --> 00:39:09.405
It's based upon the presence
of the Lord in your life.

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:11.805
I promise you this.

00:39:12.705 --> 00:39:14.025
So you'll say yes to Jesus.

00:39:14.025 --> 00:39:17.205
You'll make a resolution that's
godly that aligns with the fear

00:39:17.205 --> 00:39:20.175
of the Lord and the love of Christ
and the commission of Christ.

00:39:20.175 --> 00:39:23.445
I promise you it'll change your life
and you'll look back and you'll say

00:39:23.445 --> 00:39:28.305
20, 22 may have not been perfect, but
it was a year that defined my life.

00:39:29.235 --> 00:39:33.785
It could define everybody's life,
whether you choose to accept it.

00:39:34.634 --> 00:39:39.015
So as we pray, and as we sing,
you want to talk about what it

00:39:39.015 --> 00:39:40.065
means to give your life to Christ.

00:39:40.065 --> 00:39:41.955
If you want to talk about what
it means to take a next step,

00:39:42.404 --> 00:39:43.484
come talk to me in the back.

00:39:43.484 --> 00:39:45.525
I'm talking to me at the next
steps table after service.

00:39:46.065 --> 00:39:48.105
Um, I want to be here to help you in that.

00:39:48.555 --> 00:39:52.214
Um, so let's pray, Lord Jesus,
we thank you Lord for who you are

00:39:52.214 --> 00:39:53.415
and we thank you for your word.

00:39:54.075 --> 00:39:57.075
And we thank you for the things
that you've given us Lord as

00:39:57.194 --> 00:40:01.424
guiding, um, pieces in our life,
Lord, to live a life that reflects.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.960
To those around us Lord, but also
just, um, uh, benefits our life Lord.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:12.360
And so I just pray Lord that if there
is anything in this message, Lord

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.020
that spoke to a person in this room
or that they will take it and they

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:19.350
will begin to apply it to the lives
Lord and begin to live it out in a way

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:23.880
that honors you and Lord in a way that
changes someone else's life around them.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.630
Lord, I pray again, if there's someone
in this room that doesn't know you,

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.634
um, Lord that today, maybe the day
that they nail it down or maybe

00:40:31.634 --> 00:40:35.084
that's their 20, 22 resolution, is
that they give their lives to you.

00:40:35.084 --> 00:40:36.464
And they begin to grow
in that relationship.

00:40:36.794 --> 00:40:38.415
And maybe their lives
changed because of it.

00:40:39.044 --> 00:40:41.504
And Lord, if it is, I
pray that they move today.

00:40:41.504 --> 00:40:44.024
Lord, if it's during the song to
come back and talk to me, or if it's

00:40:44.024 --> 00:40:47.834
after service, Lord, I pray that they
come and ask questions about what it

00:40:47.834 --> 00:40:50.834
means to follow you, Lord, because
that is the greatest resolution

00:40:50.834 --> 00:40:53.475
anyone can make is to commit to you.

00:40:54.645 --> 00:40:56.595
And so Lord, we love you and
we thank you for who you.
