00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.350
Uh, Um, so today's text is going to
be really neat, as we do have our

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.840
eighth and fifth grade, uh, in here.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.290
So, again, thank you so much
for being part of worship today.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.250
Um, today's text is going
to be Ephesians chapter six.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.230
We're going to be just at
the first three verses.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.269
So, if you have your Bible
with you, you can turn to that.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.900
If you don't have your Bible with
you, you can pick up one on your

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.280
way out on the next step of six.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.093
If you'd like to have a Bible in your
phone, which is the greatest way to

00:02:33.093 --> 00:02:36.544
carry a Bible, because I'm, if you're
just like me, I'm gonna figure out

00:02:36.544 --> 00:02:40.660
how to type, is, um, It's the new
version of Bible that you should all

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.600
know about, which is really good.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.490
I use it for daily devotions,
um, anything in orthography.

00:02:46.855 --> 00:02:51.575
Uh, but Ephesians chapter 6, verses
1 through 3, and here it is what

00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:56.575
we're really doing is we're really
looking at how, um, children await

00:02:56.695 --> 00:02:59.465
their parents, which is a great
reason why our kids are here.

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:03.064
I'm hoping that, uh, they get as much
out of this as their parents will

00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:08.810
because it's also speaking to, um,
older, um, adults as well, uh, sitting

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.570
or obeying or following their parents.

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:18.590
And we'll kind of to start off this
way is, um, and I'm hoping, again,

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.630
since my kids, I talk to my kids
tangentially, but if kids, if you guys

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.550
are looking this way, how many of you
at all have your parents telling you

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.490
to do something you don't want to do?

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.970
By the way, raise hands.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.329
Okay, give me a couple of examples, kids.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.940
What have your parents told you
to do that you didn't want to do?

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.970
What?

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.090
Lean in a room.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.799
Lean in a room.

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:41.892
That's a good one.

00:03:41.892 --> 00:03:42.415
What up?

00:03:42.415 --> 00:03:43.310
Lean in a room.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.829
Ride on one of these.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.870
Save money.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.430
Save money.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.690
That's a good one.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.299
That's a good one.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.530
Right?

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.570
So, I think you guys did this right.

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.800
Is there sometimes where our parents,
as any adult that you guys have grown

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.829
up, your parents were telling you to do
something that you didn't want to do?

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.670
Wanted to do.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.150
Right.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.260
And it was difficult because you
felt like there was a great reason

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.180
why my son is the greatest at this.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.270
He usually, every time I tell him
to do something, he's got great

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.400
reason why he shouldn't have to do.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.450
And he, I may a lawyer goes, he's right
sometimes, but one you guys an example

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.560
of a time where, uh, my grandma actually
know my mom and dad and my grandma.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.620
Um, told me I could do something,
but I really didn't know what

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.350
I was going to do with it.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.280
So my brother is 6 years older than me.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.430
And, uh, you guys probably
understand this, but we have

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.900
siblings that are older than me.

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:38.650
And my brother would pick on me.

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.009
You know, older brothers tend
to pick on older brothers.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.979
I don't know if you guys have
that happen up here at all.

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:43.859
Me, not absolutely.

00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:44.459
Okay?

00:04:44.549 --> 00:04:47.280
But the little brother, me...

00:04:47.735 --> 00:04:49.995
Finally was set up with it,
so I went to my grandma.

00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:54.835
And I said, me, Nicole Delaney, it's
me, can I use this Google Callback?

00:04:54.905 --> 00:04:55.695
She said, sure.

00:04:56.615 --> 00:04:59.415
So I grabbed that thing my
brother, trying to get it.

00:05:00.055 --> 00:05:00.774
The Google Callback.

00:05:01.194 --> 00:05:03.904
Okay, I don't know if you guys
would, uh, want to do that,

00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:04.684
maybe with your older sibling.

00:05:05.475 --> 00:05:06.134
Here's the thing.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.900
That's not what she had thought I
was going to use it for, and she

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.700
started to tell me, You can't do that.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.910
And I'm like, Why?

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.170
It's pick up.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.730
And, and I didn't even really want
her to take it that way for me.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.489
Punishment tell you is, I think all
of us understand the idea of it's

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:26.209
difficult, especially with kids.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.600
To be told what to do,
especially when you don't agree.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.110
So I'm hoping today, kids, and for
parents, and for grandparents, that

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.730
today's text is kind of helpful in this.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.419
And so, um, as we walk through this
text together, I want to catch you up.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.780
Recently we've been talking
about, um, someone who is

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.989
filled with the Spirit of God.

00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:49.409
Someone who would claim to
have a relationship with Jesus.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.730
Should have evidence that they have
a relationship with Jesus, right?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.790
I mean, you guys agree with that?

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.400
If you believe that you can give your
life to Jesus, you should have evidence.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.080
So we've been talking about, there's
three evidences that Paul talks about,

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:07.019
and Paul's the writer of this book,
that we should have as a believer,

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.299
someone who's filled with the Spirit.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.390
It's one who is joyful, one who is
thankful, and one who is submissive.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.700
And verse 21 of chapter 5 actually
says this, just so you guys know, it's

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.460
one another in the view of Christ.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.759
And so, in order to submit to
one another, it has to be in

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.100
the context of relationships.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.720
So Paul kind of said, hey, so we're
supposed to submit to one another.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.740
But then he's not going to just leave
it there, he's going to say, hey, let's

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.450
talk about the types of relationships.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.770
That submission should be practiced.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.140
And the first thing we did, which was the
last week, is something We made it happy.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.479
We went and asked, why is it customs?

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.530
We should submit it to one another
as soon as it's submitted to us.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.640
And so we learned that.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.179
And honestly, I feel like it was a really
good reminder for me that if there's

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:53.770
issues Or struggles within my marriage.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.880
I should be blaming another person.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.010
I should be going to the Lord
to give my life to the Lord.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.909
Before I come back and know what
that means or whatever it is.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.050
Um, and so we learn that in the
marriage that we are actually one.

00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:06.800
We are joined together as one.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.620
We are fighting and disagreeing.

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:10.609
Actually fighting against ourselves.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.280
Uh, it's a losing battle.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.330
Um, but so we've learned this, so we
should be submissive in our relationship

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.220
with each other in marriage within today.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.810
We get to, to look at this text from
the people of how children are so be

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.071
submissive to their parents and why,
why be submissive to their parents

00:07:27.076 --> 00:07:29.830
or obey their parents are, follow
their parents and what they say.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.180
And again, um, Paul's
speaking to believers.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.590
And there's a reason why it would be
important for kids to understand the

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.360
relationship with Jesus, why they would
probably fall in love with their parents.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.520
And so, um, here, here's
what's going on in Paul's day.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.800
This is a letter that was wrote to a
specific church, the church of Genesis.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.830
And there will be children present,
but we, we need to read this letter.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.739
And so this is why it's important,
kids, why you're here today.

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:57.780
So let's read Ephesians
chapter 6, verse 1 through 3.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.880
And it says this, Children,
obey your parents and obey

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.860
God, because this is right.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.219
Honor your father and mother, which is
the first commandment, with a promise.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:13.406
So that it may go well with you, and that
you may have a long life in the Lord.

00:08:13.406 --> 00:08:14.266
So let's pray.

00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:18.339
Lord Jesus, thank you for giving us
this opportunity to give you your word.

00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:20.319
To come out here today.

00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:23.860
That all of us can live here today with
something that will apply to our lives.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.260
Because we know your word is true.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.530
And that as we hear it, Lord, that
it does, um, Give us great wisdom,

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.164
Lord, on how to walk, and be in
here in his first verse is that

00:08:35.164 --> 00:08:35.900
because they are Christians in the

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.180
Lord.

00:08:47.419 --> 00:08:50.819
to, again, believers.

00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:54.899
So he is speaking to children who
have a relationship with Jesus.

00:08:55.189 --> 00:08:58.810
So this is not me saying, everybody
in here, has a relationship with

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.440
Jesus, or every kid that has a
relationship with Jesus is blessed.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:07.550
To be honest, obedience starts
with a relationship with Jesus.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:12.780
If you would say this, um, a
child has disobedience, they're

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.350
disobedient as a parent, they've
never been blessed with Jesus,

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:16.759
that's kind of what you would expect.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.610
Just being honest, um, I'll tell
you this, as wrong or right.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:23.840
So we have to look at

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:34.370
this as policy made to believers,
the children who have to Jesus.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.429
And so, the first reason why they should
go to their parents is because they

00:09:37.429 --> 00:09:39.309
have given their lives to Jesus, right?

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.500
Um, and so, when we think about this
relationship, and this is, this was

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.220
interesting, when we think about
last week's relationship where the

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.539
wives and the husbands submitted
to perform a third and the children

00:09:49.539 --> 00:09:54.820
submitted to obey, here's the perfect
picture of a family, um, who submits.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.720
And so, the Christian home should
look like this, the wives submit to

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.570
the husbands and unto the Lord, and
the husbands love his wife, even as

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.110
Christ loved the church, and children
obey their parents and the Lord.

00:10:04.915 --> 00:10:07.335
So I don't know about you guys,
but that seems like a show I've

00:10:07.335 --> 00:10:09.665
watched where I'm like, there's
no way to watch this perfect.

00:10:10.195 --> 00:10:11.214
There's no way to watch this perfect.

00:10:11.215 --> 00:10:17.515
And here's what we need
to do to watch this.

00:10:19.345 --> 00:10:19.554
Is tangible.

00:10:22.634 --> 00:10:23.284
It is tangible.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:29.530
But, because we know why this is
hard, right, we have to understand

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.590
that what Paul is saying here is he's
speaking to people who have given

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.020
their lives to Jesus, or children
who have given their lives to Jesus.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:41.130
So this is where he says, um, children
don't make an appearance in the Lord.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:41.790
That's where it starts.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:47.355
So kids, um, today, you should
This is speaking to, why

00:10:47.365 --> 00:10:48.755
would you obey your parents?

00:10:48.845 --> 00:10:51.155
This is speaking to, you
know, One, because you didn't

00:10:51.155 --> 00:10:51.725
give your life to Jesus.

00:10:51.725 --> 00:10:53.555
And if you have given your
life to Jesus, maybe that's the

00:10:53.555 --> 00:10:54.895
question you do have for the kids.

00:10:55.125 --> 00:10:56.524
Well, how have I given my life to Jesus?

00:10:56.525 --> 00:10:57.784
And what does that mean for all of them?

00:10:58.405 --> 00:11:01.415
Maybe as a parent, you're saying,
How do I give my life to Jesus?

00:11:01.445 --> 00:11:05.645
Because if my kids are supposed to
obey and go to the Lord, then maybe

00:11:05.855 --> 00:11:08.075
I can set the example to do that.

00:11:08.395 --> 00:11:11.085
And that's actually the rule
we saw about, um, like, parent

00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:12.395
child litigation later on.

00:11:12.495 --> 00:11:16.240
That idea behind really just giving,
Ourselves up to the Lord, submitting,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.407
uh, to Him to raise our children.

00:11:20.407 --> 00:11:23.355
And so, what does it mean in your way,
just to kind of say this in, in this,

00:11:23.565 --> 00:11:27.895
uh, simple idea is to do or follow
whatever you're asked to by your parents.

00:11:28.135 --> 00:11:31.674
Um, one of the questions that is greatly
asked is what if your parents are asking

00:11:31.674 --> 00:11:33.924
you to do something that is sinful?

00:11:34.184 --> 00:11:36.505
Well, obviously that's something
that if you're in the Lord,

00:11:36.535 --> 00:11:38.145
you wouldn't want to do, right?

00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:39.705
And you could say that.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.180
Um, and not in this way, but this
is speaking to one, when we're

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.300
talking about raising a child.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.550
So let me ask this, kids.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:52.140
Um, have your parents ever told you not
to do something that you did anyways?

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:52.990
Anybody?

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:55.510
Anybody?

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:57.189
So we're all kids, right?

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.590
We're all kids.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:11:59.740
Yes.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:00.530
Okay.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.060
How many of y'all either broke something,
hurt yourself, after the meeting?

00:12:08.035 --> 00:12:08.525
Anybody.

00:12:09.915 --> 00:12:10.205
Okay.

00:12:10.905 --> 00:12:15.375
So this is the part where we look
and we say, okay, we understand

00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:19.125
our parents are pretty smart on why
they wouldn't haves do things right.

00:12:19.695 --> 00:12:24.585
Why did, there's a reason why they say
don't do this, and in most times it's

00:12:24.855 --> 00:12:26.655
kids' is because of the protecting.

00:12:28.035 --> 00:12:29.755
So let me, let me step out there.

00:12:30.275 --> 00:12:36.735
Every adult woman, we have a healing
father, who in his word, gives us wisdom.

00:12:37.725 --> 00:12:39.895
And things that says, don't do this.

00:12:40.345 --> 00:12:44.615
Not because he's trying to stop you from
having fun and all these rare things.

00:12:44.615 --> 00:12:46.435
You It's not good for you.

00:12:46.435 --> 00:12:48.425
It's not best for you.

00:12:48.595 --> 00:12:51.715
And so when you go ahead and say
forgive me God, I don't care what your

00:12:51.715 --> 00:12:55.015
words are, I'm going to go ahead and
do it, and then you see the result

00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:59.245
of it, whether it's heartache, or
struggle, or pain, you realize your

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:01.845
heavenly father knows more than you.

00:13:01.845 --> 00:13:03.395
It's the same exact picture.

00:13:03.744 --> 00:13:05.084
Because it's easy to look
at our kids know this.

00:13:09.025 --> 00:13:13.855
I'll say something to my kids, yet
I won't live it out in my father.

00:13:14.915 --> 00:13:19.195
And I go, okay, if I've told
them to do this, obey me.

00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:22.434
But I'm not obeying my father
and what example am I setting?

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:23.930
It's challenging.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.410
So if you want your kids, I'm gonna
ask the parents this question, if you A

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.070
lot of times we put pressure on our kids.

00:13:38.889 --> 00:13:39.689
Do this.

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:40.619
Be right.

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:40.910
Sit up straight.

00:13:41.459 --> 00:13:42.479
This is taking class.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.050
Are we sitting in a table?

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:46.270
Sorry, let's just talk.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:51.149
So, again, when you look at this, we
know that Paul gave us four reasons why

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:52.979
children should obey their parents, right?

00:13:52.979 --> 00:13:56.800
First is because they are Christians
in the Lord, that they follow Jesus,

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.440
and so they should also follow their
parents, because God knows everything.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.640
But the second one was that,
oh, the answer's right.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.599
So he says this in the first verse,
again, children obey their parents,

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.445
again, in the Lord, Because this is right.

00:14:07.505 --> 00:14:08.485
So I'll go back to this.

00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:11.345
Um, I'll go talk to some kids.

00:14:11.425 --> 00:14:15.465
How many, how many kids think that
your parents are smarter than you?

00:14:17.825 --> 00:14:21.525
Anybody think that your Because
some of you think that your

00:14:21.525 --> 00:14:22.239
parents are smarter than you.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.350
Here's the truth, they are.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.690
Okay, they are.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.506
So, since parents brought the
children into the world, So, if

00:14:31.506 --> 00:14:34.149
you're here, it's because your
parents brought you into the world.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.270
They are smarter than you.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.380
They have more knowledge.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.860
They can live longer than you.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.309
And so it is right to obey your
parents because of that fact.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.420
You know, it's, it's, it's, in
society today, though, this is

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.750
usually the picture of, if someone
was to rewrite this verse based upon

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.560
today's society, it would say this.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.540
Parents obey their children in
the Lord, for this is, will keep

00:14:56.699 --> 00:14:58.500
them happy and at peace at home.

00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:03.569
And parents, it's not right to love them.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.780
Kids dictate the rules, and it's
not because they're just being, you

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:13.770
want them to be raised right and to
respect authority, to love the ruler.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.170
So discipline, kids, I know
you're going to like this, but

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.170
it's the same thing for adults.

00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:19.299
Discipline is good.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.699
God says he chases what he disciplines
and those who he loves so much.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.430
Can't you This is

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.630
my life, this is a car once again.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:33.740
I love you, this is a kid.

00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:37.790
Um, so parents, here's,
here's to me, here's to me.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:38.810
God bless.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.520
Because parents actually play a role.

00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:42.270
of God and the kids lives.

00:15:42.449 --> 00:15:45.339
Don't get what I'm saying wrong with this.

00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:46.979
Not that they are God.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.150
But in actual place, the kids,
when they submit, they follow

00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:54.029
the parents and they obey them.

00:15:55.229 --> 00:15:56.819
They're actually being crossed.

00:15:56.879 --> 00:15:59.999
If you guys remember last week, those
were here last week when we talked about

00:16:00.689 --> 00:16:05.519
why submit to your husbands add unto the
Lord when the wife submit to her husbands,

00:16:05.524 --> 00:16:07.319
she's actually submitted to cross.

00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:09.729
So when the kids, as you are.

00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:12.439
Obeying parents, you're
really obeying God.

00:16:12.819 --> 00:16:14.689
Like, to me, it's a
bigger picture sometimes.

00:16:15.869 --> 00:16:18.799
It's more than just obeying my parents.

00:16:18.859 --> 00:16:20.239
It's really obeying God.

00:16:20.239 --> 00:16:24.139
Because that helps me in knowing
why I should follow my parents.

00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:28.739
Um, but it's dependent upon us parents.

00:16:29.129 --> 00:16:30.229
And I'll start speaking to myself.

00:16:30.229 --> 00:16:32.459
It's a while.

00:16:37.114 --> 00:16:42.274
Um, and here's the thing, there's
times I don't want to to, right?

00:16:43.084 --> 00:16:47.124
Um, but they need it because
they, I needed it as a kid.

00:16:47.494 --> 00:16:50.584
And God even knows that
I needed it as an adult.

00:16:50.624 --> 00:16:52.474
There's a time for God
to discuss it with me.

00:16:52.894 --> 00:16:57.374
And if you want to know how I got past
that, um, I'll tell you, there's times

00:16:57.374 --> 00:16:59.204
where God gets me to worship, right?

00:16:59.254 --> 00:17:01.249
Not physically, right, but...

00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:04.249
Emotionally realizing sin in my
life and how I really been in.

00:17:04.249 --> 00:17:08.869
So, um, so me, Paul continues
to build on us, right?

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:11.539
So he gets four weeks into the
first two as if they're a Christian

00:17:11.539 --> 00:17:15.409
in the Lord, one if obedience is
right, and two is in verse two.

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:18.679
It says, honor your father
and mother, which is the

00:17:18.679 --> 00:17:19.859
first commun with the promise.

00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:24.089
So, when you actually look
at this text, that example is

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:25.339
actually from the Old Testament.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:29.090
It's actually the 5th commandment in
the kids, it's the 1st commandment.

00:17:29.929 --> 00:17:34.320
Um, and so it still applies to,
this is the fun part, parents.

00:17:34.749 --> 00:17:35.469
It applies to you.

00:17:35.479 --> 00:17:36.759
Grandparents, it applies to you.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.089
Kids, it applies to you.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.529
Because we're honoring your parents.

00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:42.074
This can happen even
after you were raised.

00:17:42.734 --> 00:17:46.034
So the question is, what
does honor look like?

00:17:46.854 --> 00:17:48.124
What does honoring your parents look like?

00:17:48.254 --> 00:17:51.524
So it could mean showing respect
and love for them, that you care

00:17:51.524 --> 00:17:56.704
for them, um, ask them to be good
parents, um, bringing them honor by

00:17:56.704 --> 00:17:58.584
how you live, how you treat people.

00:17:58.984 --> 00:18:01.734
And one of the things that I'll
often, my parents say, force a crowd.

00:18:03.044 --> 00:18:04.104
You know what they're saying?

00:18:04.924 --> 00:18:06.599
It's that you're honoring
people by how you live.

00:18:08.719 --> 00:18:10.699
And the part where I'll
attempt to take a step back.

00:18:11.269 --> 00:18:14.040
I know that not everybody in here
is really just amazing parents.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.339
If you grew up in a struggling home,
I don't want you to sit there and say,

00:18:16.339 --> 00:18:17.919
Well, if God is taking away my dad,

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.399
then I don't know what he can do with him.

00:18:22.399 --> 00:18:26.029
And that's the, the truth is, God,
God is taking away my, your dad.

00:18:26.169 --> 00:18:27.620
My dad, or her dad.

00:18:28.215 --> 00:18:29.215
There's a number of that out there.

00:18:29.215 --> 00:18:30.394
God is greater than that.

00:18:30.715 --> 00:18:32.254
He actually can love you perfectly.

00:18:32.254 --> 00:18:35.404
He actually can give
you love consistently.

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:37.284
He actually won't abandon you.

00:18:37.364 --> 00:18:39.154
So if you're dealing with that,
you better deal with that.

00:18:39.164 --> 00:18:40.924
Just know that that's not who God is.

00:18:40.944 --> 00:18:43.894
And that's why, at times, when we
sit here and say, Why do we follow?

00:18:44.659 --> 00:18:46.320
Jesus, and why did we
give our lives to God?

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.879
It's because maybe you did
have that absence in your life.

00:18:48.879 --> 00:18:52.820
And you need a Father, Heavenly Father,
to take the place of your Father.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:53.349
Where he missed out.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.399
Um, and that's what,
how good God is, right?

00:18:58.999 --> 00:19:02.949
So we, we see, again, just kind of
building on this, is what does it

00:19:02.959 --> 00:19:04.489
look like to honor your parents?

00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:06.830
And I'm just beginning to think
about this, if anybody can remember

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:12.584
the story, where like, Jesus, Their
family was traveling back, and Jesus

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:13.654
wasn't there when they got back.

00:19:13.654 --> 00:19:14.414
Anybody remember that?

00:19:15.174 --> 00:19:18.494
And so, most of us, that's
probably, like, did Jesus not

00:19:18.495 --> 00:19:20.044
follow this command of his parents?

00:19:20.844 --> 00:19:21.834
It depends on how you look at it.

00:19:22.034 --> 00:19:25.034
But you know what Jesus did is he
actually showed honor to his parents

00:19:25.084 --> 00:19:26.674
all the way until they got older.

00:19:27.414 --> 00:19:30.024
He showed honor by following
him and obeying him.

00:19:30.034 --> 00:19:34.154
So Jesus actually set the example
for us to, I mean, he was truly

00:19:34.154 --> 00:19:35.504
God, so why couldn't he to?

00:19:36.824 --> 00:19:38.804
He still submitted their leadership.

00:19:39.154 --> 00:19:44.675
So as, as Jesus does that, we
get a great example with them.

00:19:45.314 --> 00:19:47.334
And so, let me just ask this question.

00:19:47.344 --> 00:19:49.225
So let's start with the kids.

00:19:50.824 --> 00:19:53.404
Kids, do you guys want to do
what Jesus wants you to do?

00:19:54.724 --> 00:19:55.084
Yes.

00:19:55.464 --> 00:19:55.754
Do you?

00:19:56.804 --> 00:19:59.164
Does anybody, any of the kids want
to do what Jesus wants you to do?

00:19:59.484 --> 00:19:59.914
Anyone?

00:20:05.364 --> 00:20:07.194
Hey, adults, do you want to
do what Jesus wants you to do?

00:20:07.414 --> 00:20:08.404
You want to follow Jesus?

00:20:09.964 --> 00:20:12.164
See, I would say most of
us would say that, right?

00:20:13.434 --> 00:20:15.644
He says to honor your parents.

00:20:15.844 --> 00:20:16.464
Honor your parents.

00:20:16.494 --> 00:20:17.974
Now, that looks different.

00:20:18.274 --> 00:20:19.484
That looks different for everybody.

00:20:19.534 --> 00:20:20.644
So let me just share this.

00:20:20.654 --> 00:20:23.784
It doesn't mean that you agree
with them in everything they do.

00:20:25.184 --> 00:20:25.804
Let me be clear with that.

00:20:25.834 --> 00:20:28.364
It doesn't mean you agree with
them in everything they do.

00:20:28.879 --> 00:20:32.539
This may be speaking more to adults
and children because sometimes kids,

00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:34.999
again, your parents are having you
do things you don't want to do, you

00:20:34.999 --> 00:20:37.759
don't fully agree with them, but you
trust them because you trust God.

00:20:38.879 --> 00:20:40.969
So, we struggle with that, right?

00:20:40.969 --> 00:20:47.679
It doesn't require us, um, to basically
accept everything that they do.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.350
It's okay.

00:20:48.719 --> 00:20:51.070
But it does require us to find
him and respect him out in

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.199
a manner worthy of the Lord.

00:20:53.729 --> 00:20:54.560
And so I'll look at this.

00:20:55.459 --> 00:20:57.789
Jesus set the example of sacrifice.

00:20:58.649 --> 00:20:58.999
Right?

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:01.679
Submitting himself to die for our sins.

00:21:02.289 --> 00:21:03.509
For us to have a relationship with him.

00:21:03.999 --> 00:21:07.974
If Jesus can submit to his Heavenly
Father, And besides, crossing the

00:21:07.974 --> 00:21:11.704
cross for our sins, we can find a
way to submit to our parents and

00:21:12.274 --> 00:21:16.734
sometimes put away our differences to
love them, to respect them for where

00:21:16.734 --> 00:21:18.004
they are, no matter what they've done.

00:21:18.424 --> 00:21:20.664
Again, it's not placing them back
in your life as though they've

00:21:20.674 --> 00:21:24.074
not done anything, but it's, it's
loving them enough to forgive them.

00:21:24.264 --> 00:21:25.274
I'll, I'll kind of push that out there.

00:21:25.274 --> 00:21:26.164
Forgiveness.

00:21:27.074 --> 00:21:27.844
That's business.

00:21:28.354 --> 00:21:33.314
If you hold unforgiveness in your
heart, it is the root of evil.

00:21:33.774 --> 00:21:36.734
Um, I lived for 23 years.

00:21:38.274 --> 00:21:41.004
Most of it was probably about
the last 10 or 15 years before

00:21:42.604 --> 00:21:44.104
I unforgiveness towards someone.

00:21:44.935 --> 00:21:46.204
If it's towards your parents, don't.

00:21:46.674 --> 00:21:52.424
You know, forgiving someone is not really
letting them out of whatever they did.

00:21:52.424 --> 00:21:55.494
It's really releasing you to live free.

00:21:56.589 --> 00:21:59.749
And getting out from under the
burden is, is important for you.

00:22:01.259 --> 00:22:05.969
So, parents, what does it look like for
you in to, if you really want to follow

00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:11.389
the Lord, you want to be a follower of
Jesus, and you want to set the example

00:22:11.389 --> 00:22:12.899
for your kids, honor your parents.

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:16.649
Honor your parents and you.

00:22:16.649 --> 00:22:20.219
Honor your parents as an adult,
and then talk to them about it.

00:22:21.769 --> 00:22:24.449
So, I know we're getting close
to the end of that answer.

00:22:24.449 --> 00:22:25.449
We're on the fourth thing here.

00:22:26.389 --> 00:22:29.779
Indicate four reasons that Christians
in the Lord, when we speak to them,

00:22:29.819 --> 00:22:31.779
you know, children should obey their
parents because they're Christians

00:22:31.779 --> 00:22:33.849
in the Lord, that obedience is right.

00:22:33.849 --> 00:22:35.179
Obedience is a command, right?

00:22:35.179 --> 00:22:36.359
It's not just a suggestion.

00:22:36.369 --> 00:22:37.049
It's a command.

00:22:37.579 --> 00:22:41.429
And when God commands something, we
should desire to follow Him, right?

00:22:41.439 --> 00:22:43.909
We didn't all just, I said all
of us, but a lot of us said, Hey,

00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:47.564
yeah, we want to follow Jesus,
so we want to obey His commands.

00:22:47.725 --> 00:22:49.084
The last is it brings blessings.

00:22:49.094 --> 00:22:49.864
This is for our kids.

00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:51.284
How many of y'all like gifts?

00:22:52.205 --> 00:22:52.674
How about adults?

00:22:52.764 --> 00:22:53.634
How many of y'all like gifts?

00:22:55.054 --> 00:22:58.024
If there's a reward in it,
I'm more likely to do it.

00:22:58.544 --> 00:22:59.195
I don't know about y'all.

00:23:00.354 --> 00:23:05.465
I mean, I'm that, that person that if
somebody says there's a prize at the

00:23:05.465 --> 00:23:07.094
end of the tunnel, So we like this.

00:23:07.514 --> 00:23:08.874
So obedience brings a blessing.

00:23:08.874 --> 00:23:11.054
So he says this, it's the first
commandment of the promise.

00:23:11.754 --> 00:23:13.504
So that it may go well with you.

00:23:13.604 --> 00:23:15.944
And that you may live a
long life in the land.

00:23:17.864 --> 00:23:19.044
So kids, I don't want you to miss this.

00:23:19.394 --> 00:23:22.314
There's a blessing and reward
in obeying the parents.

00:23:23.914 --> 00:23:27.769
Um, He says this, he says the
commandment has a promise.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.919
It's, it's with two promises, right?

00:23:30.459 --> 00:23:35.169
A child who honors the parents
can receive, uh, two things.

00:23:35.169 --> 00:23:38.159
It says it's well with him and that
he can live a long life on earth.

00:23:38.199 --> 00:23:42.539
And when I first read this verse,
So are we saying any kid that dies

00:23:42.539 --> 00:23:43.909
young did not honor the parents?

00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:44.309
No.

00:23:44.319 --> 00:23:44.989
That's not what this means.

00:23:45.709 --> 00:23:47.299
Uh, that's not meaning that at all.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.219
But basically it's such principle.

00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:50.719
So let me give you an example.

00:23:50.719 --> 00:23:54.799
Go back to when we all said,
Hey, we were, we told not to do

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:56.239
something, but we did it anyways.

00:23:57.229 --> 00:24:01.759
There's times where I dis so obey my
parents and I'm lucky to be alive today.

00:24:03.059 --> 00:24:04.589
Not everybody gets that chance.

00:24:05.089 --> 00:24:08.189
Because sometimes they do, right?

00:24:08.209 --> 00:24:09.759
And this is the part where we look at.

00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:11.069
Is there's a blessing.

00:24:11.109 --> 00:24:11.849
What's the blessing?

00:24:11.859 --> 00:24:12.929
What's the principle in it?

00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:16.009
As parents, children obey their
parents more than they want them.

00:24:16.469 --> 00:24:19.379
They'll escape a great
deal of sin and danger.

00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:22.549
Thus avoiding things that could
threaten or shorten their life.

00:24:23.599 --> 00:24:23.979
Right?

00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:25.809
It's a positive influence.

00:24:27.349 --> 00:24:29.064
So kids, when you obey
your parents, you escape.

00:24:40.494 --> 00:24:44.484
So parents, I would say this, when you
discipline your kids and whenever you

00:24:44.974 --> 00:24:48.754
want them to bring honor to you, and
you are modeling that for them, it's

00:24:48.804 --> 00:24:51.044
because you want them to live a life.

00:24:52.049 --> 00:24:56.089
That is long, that is earth, that is
well, that, that's not short lived.

00:24:56.089 --> 00:24:59.479
And so, how does this apply all of us?

00:24:59.579 --> 00:25:02.669
Again, it could be easy for you to
sit here and say, Hey, you know,

00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:05.479
I'm just an adult, there's nothing
that matters in this for me.

00:25:05.479 --> 00:25:07.949
Or maybe kids are like,
I wish I was in class.

00:25:07.959 --> 00:25:08.529
What is this?

00:25:11.254 --> 00:25:14.534
It's important for children
to learn early to honor their

00:25:14.534 --> 00:25:15.774
father in the name of the Lord.

00:25:16.174 --> 00:25:17.064
It's just important.

00:25:17.964 --> 00:25:21.104
Uh, because again, if you're setting an
example for the kids and they don't want

00:25:21.104 --> 00:25:24.134
to honor and respect you, there's a great
chance they will not honor and respect

00:25:24.134 --> 00:25:26.134
their father in the name of the Lord.

00:25:27.484 --> 00:25:29.644
And so we have to set
the example for them.

00:25:29.644 --> 00:25:32.084
But I do want to mention this, the Holy
Spirit, this is what we've been talking

00:25:32.084 --> 00:25:34.354
about, someone who is Spirit filled.

00:25:34.354 --> 00:25:38.714
Someone who is a follower of Jesus,
the one who lives inside of you, if you

00:25:38.714 --> 00:25:41.044
are saved you can honor your parents.

00:25:42.074 --> 00:25:44.644
It's called self control, that's part
of the fruit of the spirit, right?

00:25:44.644 --> 00:25:47.114
Sometimes it's that self
control we need as kids, right?

00:25:47.114 --> 00:25:47.994
Even as adults.

00:25:48.514 --> 00:25:49.664
So what's our response?

00:25:49.664 --> 00:25:53.344
First is, the only way that we'll be able
to honor our parents more is if we, this

00:25:53.344 --> 00:25:56.204
is speaking directly to kids, the only
way you'll be able to honor your parents.

00:25:57.224 --> 00:26:01.064
And the Lord is if you have a relationship
with Jesus, and so kids, if you've

00:26:01.124 --> 00:26:05.894
given your life to Jesus and you keep
dishonoring your family or your, your

00:26:05.894 --> 00:26:09.224
mom and your dad and you keep disobeying
and not following them, then you need

00:26:09.224 --> 00:26:15.314
to ask God to forgive you and to to give
you the ability to overcome that sin in

00:26:15.314 --> 00:26:17.264
your life to, to start following him.

00:26:17.504 --> 00:26:17.864
Right.

00:26:19.159 --> 00:26:22.089
Maybe, kids, it's because you haven't
given your life to Jesus that you

00:26:22.089 --> 00:26:23.239
do need to give your life to Jesus.

00:26:23.259 --> 00:26:24.209
Maybe that's where it starts.

00:26:24.569 --> 00:26:27.879
So, I'll just encourage you, if
you what it means, kids, to follow

00:26:27.879 --> 00:26:29.699
Jesus, ask your parents next to you.

00:26:29.699 --> 00:26:32.569
Say, I want to know what it means to
follow Jesus, because I want to obey you.

00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:33.969
I want to follow you.

00:26:37.084 --> 00:26:39.584
Friends, maybe this is why
God is speaking to you today.

00:26:40.124 --> 00:26:42.584
Are you setting the example
and honoring your own parents?

00:26:43.524 --> 00:26:46.144
Are you setting the example and
obeying your Heavenly Father?

00:26:48.094 --> 00:26:50.834
Aren't you disciplining your children
the way God has called you to?

00:26:51.344 --> 00:26:54.854
And maybe if you aren't, maybe
your kids are still young.

00:26:54.964 --> 00:26:55.794
What's your response?

00:26:55.794 --> 00:26:58.454
Maybe it's to repent and turn
if you haven't been doing that.

00:26:59.044 --> 00:27:02.194
Or if you have kids that are really
young, it's that you're praying right

00:27:02.194 --> 00:27:04.304
now for the Lord to give you wisdom.

00:27:04.994 --> 00:27:09.174
To be a model parent, to respect
your parents, and to discipline

00:27:09.174 --> 00:27:10.264
your kids as you behave around them.

00:27:11.824 --> 00:27:14.094
And so maybe parents usually
haven't given their life to Christ.

00:27:14.124 --> 00:27:16.454
Maybe you're just a grandparent at
this point, you haven't given your life

00:27:16.474 --> 00:27:20.244
to Christ, and you want to be a model
parent, grandparent, for your kids.

00:27:20.754 --> 00:27:21.464
What's your response?

00:27:22.084 --> 00:27:23.004
Giving your life to Jesus.

00:27:23.804 --> 00:27:26.334
And if you've given your life to
Jesus, it's asking God to give you

00:27:26.334 --> 00:27:28.054
wisdom on how to be that example.

00:27:28.574 --> 00:27:29.624
For those in your life.

00:27:30.314 --> 00:27:32.304
God's word is truth, guys.

00:27:32.504 --> 00:27:33.334
God's word is truth.

00:27:33.504 --> 00:27:35.244
So during this time, we're
going to have an invitation.

00:27:36.144 --> 00:27:37.234
Here's what an invitation is.

00:27:37.234 --> 00:27:40.074
A lot of times when we talk about
invitations, it's not really

00:27:40.084 --> 00:27:41.274
explained really well at all.

00:27:42.114 --> 00:27:46.194
But an invitation is this opportunity
to invite you in to consider

00:27:46.224 --> 00:27:47.454
what God spoke to you today.

00:27:47.934 --> 00:27:51.384
So we, we spent some time worshiping,
but in the moment of worship, really

00:27:51.384 --> 00:27:53.674
it's you taking time to praise a God.

00:27:54.724 --> 00:27:55.884
How does this apply to me?

00:27:56.524 --> 00:27:59.594
And so I gave you all those questions for
you to process through and think through.

00:27:59.594 --> 00:28:01.724
So maybe it's one of those that
you're giving to God, God help me.

00:28:02.324 --> 00:28:07.144
Um, help me be a better father, help
me be a better child to my family.

00:28:07.774 --> 00:28:12.194
Um, via obeying my parents, whatever
it is, I want you to ask God that.

00:28:12.869 --> 00:28:16.259
When kids begin, if you do have a
question about giving your life to

00:28:16.259 --> 00:28:20.089
Jesus, come by me, come by your parents,
and say, hey, you want to know Jesus.

00:28:20.309 --> 00:28:22.249
Maybe it's going to your
parents and saying sorry.

00:28:22.419 --> 00:28:24.529
Adults, maybe it's you
calling your parents when you

00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:26.259
leave and saying, I'm sorry.

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:29.259
I don't know what it is, but God loves us.

00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:33.844
So during this time of meditation,
take time to pray and say, The most

00:28:33.844 --> 00:28:36.964
important relationship you can have in
your life is a relationship with Jesus.

00:28:36.965 --> 00:28:40.774
Everything you do relies
on that relationship.

00:28:41.374 --> 00:28:43.924
So if you don't have that
relationship, you can't come see me.

00:28:44.374 --> 00:28:45.204
I would love to talk to you.

00:28:45.844 --> 00:28:46.294
So let's pray.

00:28:46.354 --> 00:28:46.934
We're Jesus.

00:28:46.954 --> 00:28:47.664
We love you.

00:28:48.309 --> 00:28:50.269
God, do what only you can do.

00:28:50.459 --> 00:28:53.639
Um, Lord, open our hearts
to what you spoke today.

00:28:54.879 --> 00:28:56.739
How you speak to us through your word.

00:28:57.139 --> 00:29:01.419
And Lord, I just pray that,
um, we leave here changed.

00:29:01.439 --> 00:29:04.109
Lord, if it's the kids they
sat next to really worried,

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:05.589
or missed out on the cross.

00:29:05.589 --> 00:29:07.959
Lord, again, they hurt something
today that struck them.

00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:10.779
Lord, as they need to ask for forgiveness.

00:29:10.779 --> 00:29:12.399
Lord, for disobeying their parents.

00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:12.879
Or maybe it's...

00:29:13.429 --> 00:29:15.829
We need to give the words to
Jesus, Lord, I pray they can do it.

00:29:15.849 --> 00:29:19.089
Lord, I pray if it's, uh, an adult
in this room, Lord, if it's a

parent, a grandparent, or a future
parent, Lord, I pray that they are

00:29:22.289 --> 00:29:30.199
asking you, Lord, to, uh, move their
hearts to, uh, set the example and

00:29:30.219 --> 00:29:32.359
be an amazing parent in the future.

00:29:32.369 --> 00:29:38.609

you for all that you'll do and

00:29:38.609 --> 00:29:40.884
uh, we pray this in your name.

00:29:44.574 --> 00:29:46.624
