00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.840
Welcome everybody to Inspiring Hope Church. Um,&nbsp;
If I do not know you I am Brittany. I am Ben's

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.080
Pastor Ben's wife and um, we our kids worship&nbsp;
with us and then you have the opportunity to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.320
actually let them go to a classroom and they get&nbsp;
to do a class back there um right now any of our

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.040
adults that are serving in kids&nbsp;
if you'll go to the back so Jenna

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.640
she's raising her hand right there and&nbsp;
then the orange shirts kind of help too.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:41.280
Christina and Peyton they're with the preschool. So&nbsp;
if you have um four and under four year olds and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.320
under they go with them and then the kindergarten&nbsp;
through fifth go with Jenna and me. I'll be going so.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.200
All right that's the kids are dismissing&nbsp;
you guys can go ahead and say that you

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.920
want to get some coffee get to&nbsp;
know somebody next to you as

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.840
the kids transition out we'll do that for&nbsp;
just a few minutes before we get started

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.200
I guess somebody should speak so I'll take some&nbsp;
time and share from God's word today. Um if you

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.680
brought a bible with you today you can turn to&nbsp;
Ephesians chapter five if you didn't here's always

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.560
my challenge to you there's two ways um if you&nbsp;
want to be able to look at God's word today one

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.800
you can see the scripture here on the screen too&nbsp;
you can download the holy bible app that's a bible

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.640
app that I actually use daily um it's really&nbsp;
encouraging for me and so you can download a

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.040
holy bible app and go to Ephesians chapter five or&nbsp;
we have bibles back here on our next steps table

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.480
if you want to go grab one of those right now you&nbsp;
can if you want one on the way out we'd love for

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.160
you to have one but again um we really value God's&nbsp;
word because we believe God's word is truth and

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.240
there's several things that we can glean from his&nbsp;
word to add to our lives to be able to encourage

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.840
us to be able to challenge us in our faith and&nbsp;
to really be able to reveal who God is um but

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.560
we're gonna be in just the first two verses and&nbsp;
most people that would hear that hey we're only

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.800
covering two verses today that means it's gonna&nbsp;
be a little bit shorter hey I'm praying the same

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.280
thing I hope it's a little shorter as well but&nbsp;
um there's just really a lot in these two verses

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.920
that God is willing to teach us um and I believe&nbsp;
that will be encouraging to each one of us but

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.480
I just really want to catch you guys up so we've&nbsp;
actually been in the book of Ephesians as a church

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.680
for I don't know how long last several months um&nbsp;
and so we just happen to be here in chapter five

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.600
and so I just want to be able to catch you up just&nbsp;
a little bit and the more you get to know me the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.000
more you get to know our church I really want to&nbsp;
involve those who want to be involved just asking

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.640
a few questions but let me just kind of catch you&nbsp;
up this book the book of Ephesians is a letter

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.560
that was wrote by the apostle Paul and again Paul&nbsp;
has wrote a lot of the new testament books if you

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.360
guys may not know that but just should be able&nbsp;
to share that with you but Paul is someone who

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.760
was changed by Christ Christ radically changed his&nbsp;
life on the road to Damascus and met him there um

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.440
and he had just basically a radical conversion&nbsp;
he began to live his life out for Jesus because

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.680
of what Jesus did for him but he wrote this&nbsp;
letter to the Ephesians right and he actually

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.560
helped plant this church about 10 years ago he&nbsp;
went to Ephesus and shared the gospel and a lot

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.360
of people came to faith in Christ and so 10 years&nbsp;
later he wants to write a letter to encourage them

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.720
the interesting thing with this letter is that&nbsp;
Paul, the writer, is writing this from prison.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.840
So how many all would want to write a letter&nbsp;
from prison to encourage someone else anybody

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.120
there's a good chance if I'm writing a letter&nbsp;
it's get me out of here find a lawyer spend

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.760
everything in the bank and get me out of here&nbsp;
and so the interesting thing with Paul is

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:50.800
Paul didn't necessarily see himself in prison&nbsp;
um writing this letter he actually wanted to go

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.000
to Rome to actually go reach real with the&nbsp;
gospel and he thought it was going to be

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.240
different but it ended up being in prison and&nbsp;
how he did that so it's interesting as we look

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.000
at this text today Paul's writing in a letter&nbsp;
to these people other believers to encourage

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.480
them to to remind them of all that God has&nbsp;
done for them and to remind them how to walk

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.080
in their faith and that really challenges us as&nbsp;
we think about this about how much Paul must have

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.600
loved these people and cared for these people to&nbsp;
really encourage them just through this letter

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.680
and so this letter is not only for them but&nbsp;
again God's word is true so it's valuable for us

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.120
um so as we look at it today it's going to be&nbsp;
hopefully encouraging to you but just to kind

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.560
of give you this uh outline so Ephesians kind&nbsp;
of broke up into three chapters at the beginning

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.680
which tells us all that Christ did for us and&nbsp;
then in the last three chapters is how we start to

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.960
walk in and so this is the part where I want to&nbsp;
include those who want to be a part of it again

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.600
I'm not calling people out on this but those who&nbsp;
maybe have been walking through this text with us

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.440
or maybe those who have a relationship with Jesus&nbsp;
if we're looking at today's text in light of what

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:00.000
God has done for us here's my question to you&nbsp;
what has God done for you or maybe you've been

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.840
walking through this book with us maybe what are&nbsp;
some things that God has shown you in the first

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.680
three chapters of what God's done for you so go&nbsp;
ahead somebody share I'd love for someone to share

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.240
what's God done for you or based upon what&nbsp;
we've been studying what has God done for you

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.840
what else is Christ in for us

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.880
we woke you up this morning got you here that's&nbsp;
awesome that's awesome anybody else want to share

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.560
so here's the reason why I asked that question&nbsp;
is Christ has done a lot for every one of us

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:53.600
whether you've accepted him chosen to follow him&nbsp;
or not um see God has given us new life seeing the

00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:00.400
beginning of Ephesians chapter one it says that&nbsp;
he chose us God chose us to become children of God

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.880
and so he offered himself as a sacrifice not&nbsp;
only to save us but to really give us a purpose

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.320
here on earth but also a purpose in heaven and&nbsp;
eternity and so there's several things that he's

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.200
taught us in these first couple chapters but&nbsp;
based on what God has done for us through Jesus

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.520
we're going to learn today that we should imitate&nbsp;
God and so I'm going to read this text here

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.840
in Ephesians chapter 5 in the first couple&nbsp;
verses here's what it says it says therefore

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:34.000
be imitators of God as dearly beloved children&nbsp;
and walk in love as Christ also loved us

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.440
and gave himself for us a sacrificial and fragrant&nbsp;
offering to God so let's pray Lord Jesus thank you

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.800
again for the opportunity to open your word and&nbsp;
read it but Lord also to talk about it and see how

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.000
Lord this affects our lives and so we&nbsp;
just pray this in your heavenly name

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.640
amen and so we're given two&nbsp;
commands out of this test

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.080
they're gonna be pretty simple straightforward but&nbsp;
there's depth in them and so the first thing that

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.440
Paul says is that we're to imitate Christ and&nbsp;
so when you think of imitation you may think of

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.920
a lot of different things okay here's the things&nbsp;
I think of I think of mimicking and if you have kids

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:20.400
you've heard one of your kids yell out mom&nbsp;
so and so is basically copying me right

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.920
it's annoying but that's not the invitation that&nbsp;
god's or that Paul's talking about here when we

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.720
talk about imitating God it's actually a good&nbsp;
thing right it's the good attributes of God to

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.480
imitate um whenever I think about also imitation&nbsp;
I think of following someone's patterns right

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.200
you can actually replace the word imitate with&nbsp;
follow um here's another great example so I have

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.800
a son that's ten and the son that's three the son&nbsp;
of three is three follows him around and literally

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.200
does everything he does there's times&nbsp;
where they're watching TV at the

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.880
dinner table and so they turn my older son turns&nbsp;
his chair to be able to watch the TV and eat

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.560
see here's the thing my older son can lean over&nbsp;
the table because he's old enough he understands

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.480
that it's not drop crumbs in the ground but my&nbsp;
younger son he turns the chair just like him he

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.720
has to because he wants to imitate him because he&nbsp;
drops crumbs on the ground but that's the type of

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.120
invitation I think that was just within my family&nbsp;
so let me maybe step out here where you guys know

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.000
anybody here a basketball fan let's just go a&nbsp;
little bit deeper anybody had Kobe Kobe fan

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.440
okay what about let's go a little bit further back&nbsp;
anybody at Michael Jordan fan we're not sitting

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.120
here debating whether who's great or Michael's&nbsp;
group but anyway we're not going to delay

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.440
but here's the reason why does anybody know even&nbsp;
though Kobe would have did it does anybody know

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:39.200
that Kobe spent the majority of his life&nbsp;
imitating Michael see he was his own self but

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.760
yet he spent time watching video over and over&nbsp;
again it's the way that he shot the basketball

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.280
the way that he played defense the way that he&nbsp;
celebrated the way that he won championships

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.240
was to imitate Michael see I think about this&nbsp;
you guys may think I'm funny so in the age that

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:00.000
I grew up um I was a huge Tiger Woods fan so&nbsp;
out on the golf course I wore the red you know

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.840
polo you guys know what I'm talking about when&nbsp;
I made the long putt you know what I did oh yeah

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:11.520
right that was me but I was never good enough&nbsp;
to imitate the tiger woods really on the course

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.760
at all but I like that idea that's so that's&nbsp;
the things I think about imitation right when

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.920
we think about how do we imitate someone well&nbsp;
here's the question when Paul says we are to

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:32.400
imitate Christ does that sound like a challenging&nbsp;
task to you anybody how can I a person imitate

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:39.280
follow after copy God that's a great question&nbsp;
that's a challenging question but here's the

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.000
great part God didn't say Paul didn't say&nbsp;
follow Christ on your own and figure it out

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.520
he did a couple of things let me start with this&nbsp;
one yes we can imitate God because why we are

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.880
genesis 1:27 says we are made in the image of God&nbsp;
so number one we are made in the image of God so

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:03.840
we we are obviously in some forms look like God he&nbsp;
says that we are his greatest creation so that's

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.000
obviously and that gets us a little bit closer&nbsp;
to imitating God but there's a couple of the

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.400
things that God did God sent Jesus as an example&nbsp;
of how to imitate God that's why Jesus came to

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:22.640
give us a physical idea of what it looks like to&nbsp;
imitate and to follow after God see what Christ

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.160
did for us gives us that visual perspective&nbsp;
but here's the the last one if you've given

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.640
your life to Christ if you've accepted what Jesus&nbsp;
did for you on the cross to repent of your sins

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.960
then he actually gave you the holy spirit and&nbsp;
this is the cool part you have a spiritual coach

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.880
that lives inside you this is what God&nbsp;
said if you've given your life to Christ

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.440
he's given the holy spirit which is really just&nbsp;
God inside of us to guide and direct our lives

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.800
in order to imitate Christ so I know this if i&nbsp;
have a spiritual coach that's with me every day

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:56.960
never leaves me never forsakes me always guides&nbsp;
me I have a lot more likelihood of imitating God

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:02.080
you guys agree I would agree with that so&nbsp;
this is where we say yes can we ever take

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.680
out the answer is absolutely and he&nbsp;
says this that we are children of God

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.960
and so when we think about annotating God he's not&nbsp;
saying to become God that's that's one make sure

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.480
we're clear on this this is not to become a God&nbsp;
as though we are in control of every single thing

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:25.920
no he says to imitate or to walk by God and so&nbsp;
what's the difference so when we think about

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:32.720
imitating or falling after God and not being God&nbsp;
it means that we understand our place and really

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.720
knowing this that God has certain attributes&nbsp;
we can't attain he's all-powerful all-knowing

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.360
right so we we can't attain those but there are&nbsp;
some things that we can attain right holiness

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.880
kindness sacrifice love we can imitate those we&nbsp;
can imitate a prayerful life right we look at

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:56.000
god's word we learned that Jesus was again God in&nbsp;
the flesh had a prayer life that we could imitate

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.680
he invited others into a relationship with him&nbsp;
he served others right and the way that he lives

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:09.040
we can imitate and so obviously when we think&nbsp;
about this invitation this is something I just

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:16.080
I woke up this morning and God just really brought&nbsp;
this to mine one of the things that we can imitate

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:23.200
God in is in our suffering and in our struggles&nbsp;
right Christ gave his life for us gave it up

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.600
so that we could know him have a relationship&nbsp;
with God spend the eternity in heaven with him

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.520
but we can relate to God in his&nbsp;
suffering but here is the greatest thing

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:41.200
if you're imitating Jesus in his suffering you'll&nbsp;
also imitate Jesus in the victory that he claimed

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:49.360
over dead fell in the grave see he says&nbsp;
this he says for I have overcome the world

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.480
right and God has reminded us that we&nbsp;
have not been given a spirit of fear

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.560
but of power and love and sound mind these are all&nbsp;
things that God says that we can imitate him in

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:04.000
so we see this right that we can imitate God&nbsp;
that's the first command that Paul says but what's

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.320
the second thing he says he says that we should&nbsp;
imitate God but then we should also walk in love

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:16.640
so let's look at this he says and to walk in love&nbsp;
as Christ also loved us okay so what's it mean to

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:22.000
walk in love and so let me just give you this&nbsp;
other side of this he doesn't say the sprint

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.800
in love how many of y'all were sprinters in high&nbsp;
school maybe college in vegas for entering here

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:33.360
we got one we got two okay did you guys sprint for&nbsp;
a mile or did you sprint for like a short distance

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:40.960
short distance why you well one you couldn't you&nbsp;
couldn't hold that pace it wouldn't sprint anymore

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.640
at a mile so Paul's saying to walk in love&nbsp;
which means we are to consistently walk in

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:53.440
love not just in moments of love and so whenever&nbsp;
I think about this it's easy to do something

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.640
like once maybe to walk in or to sprint in love&nbsp;
once but he seemed to walk consistently right

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:04.000
to walk consistently and I actually looked as&nbsp;
a kid somebody there's got to be somebody out

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.440
there that has this record for walking and not&nbsp;
stopping and so there was george wiggin walked

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:16.080
19 000 miles in 2400 days it says the longest&nbsp;
unbroken walk that's a long time of walking

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:22.640
so when we picture walking I want you to picture&nbsp;
that long distance consistency in walking in love

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.200
but here's the question okay so walk in love&nbsp;
is love an emotional feeling just this all

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.360
all this inside just squishy you know that's&nbsp;
usually what I felt like whenever I first met

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:39.120
my wife I mean it was all emotional like inside&nbsp;
but I began to understand love was patient love

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:45.200
was kind love was long suffering she's not in&nbsp;
the room don't tell her I said that but this

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.840
is exactly what Paul's talking about see Paul&nbsp;
talked about this in first corinthians 13 and

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:55.200
I'm just going to read this out it says love is&nbsp;
patient love is kind love does not envy love is

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:01.600
not boastful love is not arrogant love is not rude&nbsp;
love is not self-seeking love is not irritable

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.360
I'm going to say that again love is not&nbsp;
irritable somebody need to hear that

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.920
it does not keep a record of wrongs oh my gosh I'm&nbsp;
probably hitting some marriage issues I've been

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:17.840
there before right I'm trying to keep those&nbsp;
records I file them back so I can use them

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:26.800
love finds no joy and unrighteousness but&nbsp;
rejoices in the truth it bears all things

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:33.120
believes all things hopes all things endures all&nbsp;
things see that's the love that Paul says to walk

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.560
in consistently now what you guys may be&nbsp;
saying is that's unattainable then there's

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:47.680
no way we can walk in that absolutely you can&nbsp;
because if we imitate our father God who gave

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:54.080
us a spirit to walk alongside us and remind us&nbsp;
of what love is that we will be consistently

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:01.920
walking and learning how to be patient and&nbsp;
how to be kind if I'm just being honest um

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.600
this is a life of practice in a marriage&nbsp;
it's learning how to walk in love because

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.440
when it's a sprint it's like that&nbsp;
first date or two right it's awesome

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.600
love's great but then whenever you get to know&nbsp;
each other and you understand the differences you

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:21.120
have and the disagreements you have you learn what&nbsp;
love truly is it is working through these things

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.120
so based on that definition of love how&nbsp;
do you feel like you're doing it I mean

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.400
honestly the first time I read this this week i&nbsp;
went wow I'm struggling in a lot of these areas

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.800
so does this this type of love define me so&nbsp;
let me expect this step back just a second

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:47.120
this letter was wrote to other believers people&nbsp;
who knew Jesus and this is if you're in this

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.360
room and you don't know Jesus this is not for me&nbsp;
knocking you this is not all honestly we want you

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.720
to know who Jesus is and know that God loves you&nbsp;
but what I'm saying is the only people that can

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:02.240
attain imitation of God and the only people that&nbsp;
can attain walking in love are those who know God

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.360
and it would make sense right how could you&nbsp;
not know someone and actually do something

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.760
that's like them right so you would have&nbsp;
to know them so he's speaking to believers

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.520
so the answer is based on this definition of&nbsp;
love we should know how to walk in love and so

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.520
Paul is again saying this it's not just for the&nbsp;
gifted and talented Christians a lot of times

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.240
we say hey there's the special Christians that can&nbsp;
do this but it's not me no he's talking to all all

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.080
of us those who know him and here's the reason&nbsp;
why we should walk in love john 13 35 says this

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:39.200
but this is by this everyone will know that&nbsp;
you are my disciples if you love one another by

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:48.480
this everyone will know that you are my disciples&nbsp;
you are my children if you walk in love see one of

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.120
the things if you got to know a little bit&nbsp;
those who don't know our group as a church

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:59.840
um our church has been through a ton of stuff&nbsp;
since we've gathered a lot of tough things

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:07.280
and you want to know the one thing that&nbsp;
I think has defined our group love love

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.120
and that's what we want to be we want to show&nbsp;
the love of Christ of one another so that when

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:19.920
others see it they say where do you get&nbsp;
that and it comes from God our father

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.760
so for most of us walking when you think&nbsp;
about just walking in the natural sense

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.960
um is easy now right but but today we're&nbsp;
talking about parker's education when she's

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:33.280
over there knocked out I wish I could go to&nbsp;
sleep like that will you hold me later so I'm

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:42.800
um he can't walk right now can he no but you&nbsp;
know what he's doing you'll see him watch

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.040
megan and josh and you'll see&nbsp;
him watch grandma and grandpa

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.040
walking and eventually as he grows up guess&nbsp;
what he's gonna do he's gonna begin crawling

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.000
and he's gonna be chasing after you&nbsp;
why because he wants to imitate you

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.720
he wants to follow you and he wants to see&nbsp;
what it's like to get on those two feet and

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:06.400
use them right and to walk around fast because&nbsp;
it's slow as a kid and once they start walking

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.000
parents you know this you're chasing&nbsp;
everywhere and you're putting things up higher

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.800
and you're putting outlet plugs in if&nbsp;
you haven't done that you need to do that

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:19.440
okay why because that's what one and one as&nbsp;
a parent we want to see our kids walk right

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:27.520
we love to see that see God knows this at the&nbsp;
moment of salvation he's given us the abilities

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:34.880
followers of Jesus imitators to walk in love&nbsp;
but at times our legs are wobbly and you know

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.920
what the father does he puts his hand down&nbsp;
and he holds our hand and when we fall down

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:46.640
here what the father does he picks us up you know&nbsp;
what he does he consistently helps us because he

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.600
wants us to follow him and to walk in love&nbsp;
see he doesn't leave you to figure it out

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:59.680
on your own no God loves you so much that he&nbsp;
chose you to be his child and to walk in love

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:07.920
so what do we need if if maybe you're struggling&nbsp;
to walk in love as a believer maybe what do you

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:13.040
need if you're starting to walk in love maybe&nbsp;
apart from Christ you need Christ right you need

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:19.520
Christ to come and pick you up but I'll say this&nbsp;
you'll never know how to walk in love the way that

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:25.600
god's called you to walk in love you'll never know&nbsp;
how to imitate God unless you are close unless you

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.840
spend time with him unless you get to know him&nbsp;
and the cool part about that is every week that

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:35.920
we gather here every week that we gather in our&nbsp;
homes and our inspired groups every day that we

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.840
search God's word we're learning how to&nbsp;
walk in love and to imitate our father

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.480
so Paul gives these two reasons right so why&nbsp;
should we walk in love and why should we entertain

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.040
Jesus that's a great question why should we&nbsp;
walk in love and why should we imitate Jesus

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.240
so Paul gives these two reasons at the end of&nbsp;
each one of these commands of why we should

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.880
imitate God and want good love so let's look at&nbsp;
the first one we should imitate God because and

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.960
let's look here he says therefore be imitators&nbsp;
of God as dearly loved children so you've heard

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.000
me talk about that right children we are&nbsp;
children of God those who have given their

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.600
lives to Christ children of God and we talked&nbsp;
already about how children look up to parents

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.360
so whoever raised you whether it's a&nbsp;
grandma or grandpa maybe it's your parents

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.520
you imitated them in some ways right my parents i&nbsp;
got some good things from them and I got some bad

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:28.160
things from them right but we imitate our parents&nbsp;
and so God is saying this imitate Paul sentence

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:35.120
imitate God as dearly children as children of God&nbsp;
but I know this is the difficult part there could

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.680
be somebody in this room maybe multiple people in&nbsp;
this room that did not have good parents coming up

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.280
maybe your parents weren't absent maybe they&nbsp;
didn't raise you right I don't know what it is

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:48.080
and it's hard to look at God as a heavenly&nbsp;
father and say I want to follow my father

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:53.120
and imitate him and if you're struggling with that&nbsp;
I'm so sorry but I I do want to share this with

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.800
you that if maybe you didn't have a father present&nbsp;
maybe it's a mother I don't know what it is

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.560
good solid appearance that there's a heavenly&nbsp;
father who is a perfect example that is a

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:08.160
perfect example to follow if you didn't have the&nbsp;
father to follow he could be the father to follow

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.880
see Paul encourages didn't take our Godly father&nbsp;
who will never let us down he's a perfect example

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:20.640
let's let's look at some of the things here he he&nbsp;
will never leave you or forsake you see God sent

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.240
his spiritual lives inside you to remind you&nbsp;
of his presence so he's consistently with you

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:32.400
see God is proud to call you child he calls you&nbsp;
child he calls you kids this is the the part if

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.840
you haven't read the book of Ephesians recently&nbsp;
you need to go read the first three chapters

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.360
because there's so much in there that God says&nbsp;
he loves you but he sent ultimately Jesus to

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.840
die in your place so you can have a personal&nbsp;
relationship with him you're just not another

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:51.200
person in God's kingdom you are important to&nbsp;
him every single person is important to him

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.720
so ultimately we should imitate God because of all&nbsp;
that he's done for us and make us children of God

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.360
but there's another part right so we should&nbsp;
imitate God because we're dearly children

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.080
but we should also walk in love because it says&nbsp;
this in the second verse and to walk in love is

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:12.000
Christ also loved us and gave himself for us&nbsp;
a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.560
see Jesus loved us and gave himself for us&nbsp;
and john 15:13 reminds us this that no one

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:25.520
has greater love than this to lay down his life&nbsp;
for his friends see there's a reason why when we

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:31.120
see somebody with a hat on that that says veteran&nbsp;
that we go and we say thank you for your service

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.400
because they were willing to sacrifice&nbsp;
their lives for the those others right

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:42.080
so we honor them we see our heavenly father&nbsp;
sent Jesus to die for everyone that lives

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:49.360
and so because of that it draws us to&nbsp;
want to walk as Jesus walk walk in love

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.880
so Jesus is not only this model of perfect love&nbsp;
when we think of the life that he lived but he's

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.480
the reason for this Christian love so again today&nbsp;
if you say you have a relationship with Jesus

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.760
the only ability for you to love is what God gave&nbsp;
you and so let me tell you this the moment that i

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.720
gave my life to Christ I was married for three&nbsp;
I think it was about three years before I get

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:14.240
my life in Christ the moment I gave my life&nbsp;
to Christ was the first time I loved my wife

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.080
now you're saying oh man you're so horrible you&nbsp;
didn't love your wife before absolutely I didn't

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:24.560
love my wife before because I didn't understand&nbsp;
sacrificial love like I did before knowing Christ

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:31.280
that's exactly how we know what love is so if&nbsp;
we're ever going to walk in love it's going to be

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.720
because of the response of God's love and I love&nbsp;
this this this quote from john stott I just I had

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:46.000
to share with you guys he says this what dominated&nbsp;
Jesus mind was not living but giving up his life

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.840
see Jesus knew what he was doing&nbsp;
when he walked the road to the cross

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:57.280
the son of man must suffer many things and be&nbsp;
rejected and be killed that knowledge didn't

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:04.960
turn him away he walked on bound by his love for&nbsp;
God and for us he let the mission of God determine

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:10.560
his path he walked he wasn't surprised when it all&nbsp;
started going downhill he knew that judas would

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:16.720
betray him he knew his trial would go bad and&nbsp;
he knew the cross was coming and he accepted it

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:24.800
and loved us see the gospel is is that bold it's&nbsp;
that risky when we think of walking love Christ

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:31.120
at the example he knew it was coming for him yet&nbsp;
he still loved unconditionally and sacrificially

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:37.520
so are we really living for God and entertaining&nbsp;
God the challenge today is for you to ask that

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:43.680
question right is what's my love like am&nbsp;
I imitating God do I even know who God is

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:50.480
but when we see what Christ has done by dying on&nbsp;
the cross for us it should motivate us to walk

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.920
the love in the same way that he did&nbsp;
right because of what he's done for us

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.160
it may be easy again when we talk about loving&nbsp;
big ones right it's easy to do that one sprint

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.240
but he's saying for us to walk and love&nbsp;
so I want to get this way because I know

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.080
you guys Christ I mean when's it&nbsp;
going to be done we're almost there

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.360
Paul is speaking again directly to everyone&nbsp;
in this room this is the great part

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.600
about the timeless word of God is&nbsp;
that even though Paul wrote this

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:30.560
a long time ago that word was wrote for you&nbsp;
today and for me see I I tell people this

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:35.760
every time that I prepare a message I prepare&nbsp;
a message this way God what are you teaching me

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.600
because if God doesn't teach me first&nbsp;
there's no way I'm gonna stand up here

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.880
and share with you and then the second one is&nbsp;
is for you guys when you come in is asking this

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.760
question what's God speaking to me about today&nbsp;
he's here to speak through his words so through

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.560
Paul he gave two commands to entertain Jesus&nbsp;
and walk of God why because we're children of

00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:01.280
God and because Jesus gave his life to us right to&nbsp;
give us a purpose and hope and I want you to know

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:06.880
today that God loves you so much maybe you need&nbsp;
to hear that today that God the one that created

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:12.800
you his greatest creation loves you and he desires&nbsp;
to have a personal relationship with him he's done

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:20.160
everything to bring him to a relationship with&nbsp;
him to adopt you as children of God Jesus love

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:26.320
and sacrifice on the cross should lead each one&nbsp;
of us to daily pick up our cross and follow him

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:32.400
so what's it look like in order to imitate&nbsp;
you've got to walk closely so today if you're

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.840
a believer of Christ maybe if you're saying how do&nbsp;
I imitate God is to walk closer through a personal

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.000
daily relationship with him maybe you've&nbsp;
just fallen away from pursuing him through

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.160
his word or pursuing him through consistently&nbsp;
being a part of a church or part of a group or

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:51.040
whatever it is to walk daily with him and&nbsp;
imitate him through those things that you learn

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.280
maybe if you don't know Christ today maybe&nbsp;
you're sitting here today and you're saying

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.520
hey I just came to the vacation I don't know&nbsp;
what you're talking about I've been there before

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.040
but I pray today you've heard the truth that God&nbsp;
desires for you to know what he did on the cross

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:13.360
and so I'm gonna end this way God so loved the&nbsp;
world that he gave his son Jesus to die on a cross

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.280
in our place so you may ask this question why did&nbsp;
Jesus have to die on the cross because every one

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:22.160
of us was born with sin and that's such a tough&nbsp;
thing to understand because I don't like thinking

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.960
that I have sin in my life sin is really anything&nbsp;
we think say do or don't do that displeases God so

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:32.160
all of us again fall short of God's glory but he&nbsp;
doesn't leave us there I think that's the hopeful

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.520
part about God a lot of times we think God just&nbsp;
wants to leave us in that and he's just wanting

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:41.600
to punish us honestly no God sent his son Jesus&nbsp;
so that we could be removed from that punishment

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:47.040
of of really dying for our sins and spending the&nbsp;
eternity separated from him he chose to send his

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:53.120
son Jesus so that you could live in eternity with&nbsp;
him but this is my favorite part of the gospel

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:58.880
that he gives a hope for you to live now in&nbsp;
this life for the rest of your life I hope

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:04.880
that one God is with you through all of your&nbsp;
trials and your struggles God loves you and he's

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.760
pursuing you and you know him more and more every&nbsp;
day so my challenge today is if you haven't given

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.240
your life to Christ that you do here in a moment&nbsp;
we're going to have invitation and really this is

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:20.320
what imitation means it's a time to process to ask&nbsp;
God okay God what did you speak to me about today

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:26.800
in your word how do I respond to it for some of&nbsp;
you that may be through accepting Jesus as your

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.640
Lord and savior and if you don't know what that&nbsp;
means I would love to talk to you I don't want

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.680
to complicate it because it's not complicated to&nbsp;
know Jesus he says if you'll believe in your heart

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.000
that Jesus is the son of God and that he came and&nbsp;
died for your sins and you'll repent of your sins

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.000
and follow him you can be saved and so i&nbsp;
want to talk to you about that today as we

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.040
in service and I know we're going to end&nbsp;
up having purpose dedication right after

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.200
but even after that please come talk to me i&nbsp;
would love to share my night and know Jesus

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.280
and how you can imitate him walk in his love

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.800
and so let's let's pray

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.480
and just ask God to guide us&nbsp;
in what he taught us today

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.280
Lord Jesus I'm so thankful for you I'm&nbsp;
thankful for your word that it's truth

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:22.160
but I'm so thankful that you love us so much&nbsp;
that you sent your son Jesus to this earth

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.160
Lord I I just I know today Lord as I think&nbsp;
about what you've done for each one of us

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:37.280
the Lord each one of us can claim victory&nbsp;
over our sins and over we're just the weight

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.760
of everything that is surrounding us Lord you&nbsp;
have overcome the world in all those things and

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:48.800
so you've promised Lord to give us a relationship&nbsp;
with you Lord if we'll just believe and follow

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:56.320
you I want to thank you for your word&nbsp;
because we know it's truth or thank you

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:01.200
for opening our hearts and our minds to what&nbsp;
you may be speaking to each one of us Lord

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:10.640
we know that you have a plan for each person this&nbsp;
room and Lord as I even think about baby parker

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.840
I already see that we'll give a plan for him&nbsp;
and I'm excited word here in just a moment

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.000
to bring them both uh him&nbsp;
up and the parents of Lord's

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:26.320
to pray over them in order to commit&nbsp;
to raising him Lord to love you

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:35.040
Lord may we all leave here today Lord knowing&nbsp;
that we can be children of God and to walk in love

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:43.680
Lord we pray this in your heavenly name. Amen.
