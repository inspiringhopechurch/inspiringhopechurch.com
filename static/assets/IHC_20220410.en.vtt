00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.200
Um, Paul talking to Timothy about how
to set up leadership in the church.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.910
And he talks about elders or pastors.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.810
He talks about deacons.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.390
And so we're going to talk about
that topic of what does an elders

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.600
role and what's a deacon's role.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.020
And, and so today we're going
to talk a lot about information.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:19.305
Um, we're just talk probably a little
less about application, but we're going

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:20.895
to come back in two weeks as a church.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:24.435
So those you are part of aspire hope
consistently in two weeks, we're going to

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:27.795
come back and talk about how that applies
to our church, what that looks like in

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:30.165
appointing leaders and what the future of.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.320
Adding that into our church and,
and how that looks together.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.590
And that's the cool part, um, as a
church, as we get to do that together.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.090
Um, and so you'll hear more application
in two weeks and the fact of inspiring

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.990
hope, but more today information and a
little bit of what I would say for you

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.129
is to gain more of an understanding of
the role of a leader or an elder, but

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.110
because we, one number one believer.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:53.585
The priority of prayer.

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:55.385
We really believe that
prayer makes a difference.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:59.315
Every week we choose a certain
topic to pray over something.

00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:00.964
And one of those is to
pray over leadership.

00:01:00.964 --> 00:01:04.685
So I'm going to start us off and pray
today to pray for today's message,

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:07.715
but also just pray for the future
leadership in our church and how we move

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:09.485
in that direction, uh, for our church.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.929
So Lord Jesus, we are praying Lord, um,
and inviting you in because we want you

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:19.369
to be the one that leads and guides us as
a church Lord through this message today,

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.660
Lord, through, as we continue to, um, add,
add these things and apply these things

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.500
to our life, Lord, I pray that you give us
wisdom to do it, that we do it Lord, for

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.850
the ability for the message of the gospel
to be spread, um, and to be able to.

00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:35.455
Uh, Lord just lead us well as a church.

00:01:35.485 --> 00:01:37.494
And so we pray for your
guidance and your wisdom in him.

00:01:37.735 --> 00:01:39.085
And Lord, we just pray
for today's message.

00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:41.845
Lord may all of our hearts be
open, uh, Lord to what you want

00:01:41.845 --> 00:01:45.804
to teach us and how we can, um,
uh, learn more about that Lord.

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:48.384
And if there's an application
to it on a life as well, Lord,

00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:49.824
that we take steps in that.

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:51.955
And so Lord, we just pray
this in your heavenly name.

00:01:52.435 --> 00:01:52.824
Amen.

00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:53.425
Yeah.

00:01:54.464 --> 00:01:58.335
So I've heard this statement before that
everything rises and falls on leadership.

00:01:58.604 --> 00:02:02.865
And the more and more that I lead, um, an
organization like this church, the more

00:02:02.865 --> 00:02:04.785
and more I realized that is a true fact.

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:08.565
But as I begin to think about leadership,
I actually heard this quote and it

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:10.065
actually made me laugh a little bit.

00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:14.085
Um, and this isn't true of us, but it's
maybe true of some businesses that,

00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:18.855
um, the key to being a good leader is
keeping the people who hate me away

00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:20.204
from those who are still undecided.

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:22.665
I don't think that's true in this church.

00:02:22.695 --> 00:02:25.935
But as I was thinking through that, there
are some organizations that literally

00:02:25.935 --> 00:02:28.935
are trying to keep people who hate them
away from the ones who are undecided.

00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:32.325
That is not who we are as a church,
but I know this leadership is important

00:02:32.325 --> 00:02:34.755
in the church, but one of things
I want to talk about just right

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:37.305
up front, before we jump into this
text is just because of leadership.

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.070
Doesn't mean it's only up to
leadership to make it successful.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.010
So thinking just in general, as a
church, many times I've been a part of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.739
churches where it's, everything seems
to be on the past or the passengers

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:48.780
to make sure everything happens.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.630
And if something doesn't
happen, then it's on him.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.140
Right.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.070
But the more and more that I learned
about churches, pastors leaders in the

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.209
church have a role, an important role
that they're held accountable to above

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.790
and beyond most people, but most times.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.740
They're not the only ones that are
doing something that are involved

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.620
in the church and the success of the
church it's called the body of Christ.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.190
So every believer that would claim
Christ, that's a part of a local church,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.260
has a responsibility to help in that.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.290
And so the more and more I studied
that, that, that leadership's important.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.480
Yes, everything rises and falls
on leadership in the, in the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.770
fact of important role, but the
pressure isn't only on the leaders.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.670
And so I'm just going to challenge you in
this as a, as a follower of Jesus, myself.

00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:34.065
I know that my gifting and in
my calling is to lead, but I

00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:35.834
also know is not to lead alone.

00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:38.625
Um, and because of that, that's
why you'll hear us talk about in

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:41.174
two weeks, we're going to talk
about leadership in the church.

00:03:41.355 --> 00:03:43.304
We're going to talk about
direction of that, and you

00:03:43.304 --> 00:03:44.655
guys will be involved in that.

00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:46.875
We're going to include people
in that because it's not just.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.950
Me.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.370
And it's really more about Christ and
how Christ has brought us together

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.820
to fully work together, to fulfill
the mission that he's called us to.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.299
So I believe the success, the health
and the growth of church is on

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.769
each of us fulfilling that role.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.910
And so as we talk about leadership today,
no, that we're going to talk how each one

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.500
of us plays an important part in that.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.459
So catching you.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.299
On where we've been as a church
walking through first Timothy first,

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.350
Timothy has wrote to Timothy, and this
is Paul suit, true son in the face.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.620
So basically Paul calls
Timothy, basically his own son.

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.310
Um, and so he's raised Timothy up,
he's poured into him and he sent

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.380
Timothy to this church in Ephesus
to be the pastor to address false.

00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:29.965
Um, because there were some teachers
that were teaching things inside the

00:04:29.965 --> 00:04:33.295
church, there were leading people
away from the faith of Christ.

00:04:33.655 --> 00:04:36.775
And so here's what, what Paul is
challenging Timothy currently he's

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:41.395
saying raise up leaders, appoint
leaders, elders, deacons, to make sure

00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:44.095
that we protect the gospel message.

00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:48.415
So sort of thinking about this, why
is it important for leaders to lead?

00:04:48.415 --> 00:04:51.715
Well, and we talk about today, a
lot of qualifications when we read

00:04:51.715 --> 00:04:54.085
this, because the message is that.

00:04:55.815 --> 00:04:58.875
Leaders are placed in a position because
the message or the organization in

00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:00.795
which they lead, is that important?

00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:05.325
So why is leadership important is because
of the message that God has, that he has

00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:09.045
sent his son Jesus to die for each one
of us, so that we may have a relationship

00:05:09.045 --> 00:05:13.335
with him so that we may experience glory
in heaven with him one day, um, and

00:05:13.335 --> 00:05:15.285
that we can help share that with others.

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:19.365
And so as we jump into this text, I want
us to look at it from that standpoint.

00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:20.625
So again, first.

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:25.415
Uh, chapter three, starting in verse
one, and we'll read through verse 13.

00:05:25.415 --> 00:05:28.175
It says this, it says
this sane is trustworthy.

00:05:29.015 --> 00:05:32.855
If anyone aspires to be an
overseer, he desires a noble.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.570
And overseer, therefore
must be above reproach.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.490
The husband of one wife,
self-controlled sensible, respectable,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.770
hospitable, able to teach.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.430
Non-accessible not an excessive
drinker, not a bully, but

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.580
gentle, not quarrelsome, but not.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.100
He must manage his household hold
completely and have his children

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.600
under control with all dignity.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.380
And if anyone does not know how
to manage his own household, how

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.060
will he take care of God's church?

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.950
He must not be a new convert or he must,
or he might become conceited and incur

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.810
the same kind of nation as the devil.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.680
Furthermore, he must have a good
reputation among the outsiders so that it

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.660
is not fall into disgrace and the devil.

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:18.140
And then he says, deacons, likewise
should be worthy of respect, not

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.830
hypocritical, not drinking a lot of wine,
not greedy for money, holding the mystery

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.630
of the faith with clear conscience.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.799
They must also be tested first if
they approved to be blameless and then

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:29.989
they can serve as deacons wives too.

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.239
Must be worthy of respect, not slanderous.

00:06:32.299 --> 00:06:34.099
Self-controlled faithful in everything.

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.159
Deacons are to be husbands of
one wife managing their children,

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.630
their own households company.

00:06:39.545 --> 00:06:42.755
For those who have served well as
deacons acquire a good standing

00:06:42.755 --> 00:06:46.865
for themselves and great boldness
in the faith that is in Christ.

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.175
Jesus, I don't know about you
all, but I remember the first

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:51.965
time reading this and going, man,
I don't know if I ever want be.

00:06:52.905 --> 00:06:53.505
And the church.

00:06:53.835 --> 00:06:57.164
So pray for your leaders, pray
for me, but what I would say with

00:06:57.164 --> 00:07:00.015
this, and there's a reason behind
this, um, that there's, there's a

00:07:00.015 --> 00:07:01.784
reason behind that qualifications.

00:07:01.784 --> 00:07:05.205
There's actually 16 of them that
we have for elders or pastors.

00:07:05.414 --> 00:07:07.215
And then there's several
four deacons as well.

00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:09.075
So we're just gonna walk
through this verse by verse.

00:07:09.435 --> 00:07:12.735
Talk about what each one of these means,
um, and answer some of these questions.

00:07:12.735 --> 00:07:14.985
So first thing you see here
is he talks about an overseer.

00:07:14.985 --> 00:07:16.305
And so I want to kind of clarify this.

00:07:16.905 --> 00:07:18.585
If you study in the
Bible, there's the word?

00:07:18.585 --> 00:07:21.585
Overseer, Bishop, pastor elder.

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:26.105
Th they're responsible for
the overseen of the church.

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:28.955
And so they're listed in those titles
and the fact of different roles.

00:07:28.955 --> 00:07:30.995
And so I think of it this way
and I started just trying to

00:07:30.995 --> 00:07:31.985
process through this a little bit.

00:07:32.405 --> 00:07:33.455
I am a father of.

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:37.590
Uh, son, I'm a brother, I'm an uncle.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:37.830
Right.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.010
And I function in a different way
to each one of those roles, very

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.700
similar to those titles function, a
leader functions in different roles.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.270
And so just to kind of you an experience,
we talk about the word elder, right?

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.060
And so an elder talks about someone
who is mature with spiritual

00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:53.070
wisdom and experience, right.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.330
And that's where you hear
this thing, don't be a new.

00:07:55.405 --> 00:07:56.905
We hear the word pastor, right.

00:07:56.905 --> 00:08:00.294
Is pastors known as a shepherd, the one
who leads and cares for local believers.

00:08:00.775 --> 00:08:01.104
Right.

00:08:01.104 --> 00:08:04.854
And so something else we see, even in
Ephesians chapter four, verse 12, it

00:08:04.854 --> 00:08:10.015
says that their role leaders is to equip
the saints for the work of the ministry

00:08:10.015 --> 00:08:11.515
and to build up the body of Christ.

00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:12.775
So there's different titles.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.130
And different roles with under that title.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.210
But in essence, they're there to lead
the direction spiritually for the church.

00:08:19.659 --> 00:08:21.400
Um, if you want even more
information about this, I'll

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.049
send you to Titus chapter one.

00:08:23.349 --> 00:08:25.289
Um, and you'll hear more and
more about this, but we're not

00:08:25.299 --> 00:08:26.380
gonna address that specifically.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:31.320
But you see this term that it says
in order to be qualified, right?

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.939
These pastors had to be qualified.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.240
Um, they had to meet certain
expectations to fulfill the position.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.370
And, uh, let me ask this.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.520
I'm, I'm a person that loves asking
questions to be kinda engage you guys

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.689
to even think through this with me.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:46.350
Why do you think that there's
qualifications for a leader in the church?

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:47.819
What's the value?

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:48.689
What's important about it?

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.040
What Jonas.

00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:53.704
Right.

00:08:53.704 --> 00:08:56.135
They may not know enough about the
gospel, so they may actually lead

00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:57.335
people astray from the gospel.

00:08:57.365 --> 00:08:57.694
Right?

00:08:57.905 --> 00:09:01.355
So to have qualifications is to say, Hey,
in order to fulfill this role effectively

00:09:01.385 --> 00:09:07.385
to keep the message of the gospel pure, we
need to have people that know the message.

00:09:07.385 --> 00:09:09.635
Well, to have the character
to back up that message.

00:09:09.694 --> 00:09:10.535
So that's really good.

00:09:10.535 --> 00:09:13.444
I appreciate you, um, uh,
answering that question.

00:09:13.715 --> 00:09:18.185
So we see these 16 qualifications, again,
that a pastor or an elder must fulfill.

00:09:18.515 --> 00:09:21.095
And as I begin to think about these
qualifications, it's interesting.

00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:21.635
Each one of them.

00:09:22.425 --> 00:09:25.005
Should come out of an overflow
of a relationship with.

00:09:26.515 --> 00:09:29.995
And I say, this is so important because
so many times with pastors, it's not

00:09:29.995 --> 00:09:33.204
like you're aspiring to be something
different than just a, really a, what I

00:09:33.204 --> 00:09:37.824
would say is a true follower of Christ
at the high levels and character.

00:09:38.214 --> 00:09:41.724
And so a person can aspire to
be an elder by just following

00:09:41.724 --> 00:09:44.155
Jesus and doing what he says.

00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:45.954
And the more that you do that,
and the more that you see these

00:09:45.954 --> 00:09:47.905
things, um, follow through.

00:09:47.905 --> 00:09:51.354
And so, uh, I think it's important
to not necessarily see this as

00:09:51.834 --> 00:09:52.824
something that they should attend.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:53.970
Right.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.250
So we look at these qualifications
as I'm going to get better at these

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.390
so that I can attain this position.

00:09:58.095 --> 00:10:01.185
My encouragement for most pastors that
would attain to be, cause he says this,

00:10:01.185 --> 00:10:05.055
this is a worthy or noble work that she
should attain to be a follower of Jesus.

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:08.745
And after you see yourself begin to
follow that direction, the spirit

00:10:08.745 --> 00:10:12.495
of God begins to connect these
characteristics with the call to a pastor.

00:10:13.095 --> 00:10:16.425
And I'll talk a little bit more about
that as well, but I think it's important

00:10:16.425 --> 00:10:20.745
again, we're talking about this leadership
is why to pastors, um, leaders had these

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:25.065
16 qualifications, I believe it's because
they set the example of how to live so

00:10:25.065 --> 00:10:26.535
that believers can have a model of how.

00:10:27.535 --> 00:10:28.945
Desires us to live.

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:31.975
So not saying that your pastor's perfect.

00:10:31.975 --> 00:10:35.965
So, you know, I'm not perfect, but I
desire to meet these qualifications

00:10:35.965 --> 00:10:40.125
because I want to set the example of what
God is calling us to, to do and following.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.719
And so in that I get to model it.

00:10:42.719 --> 00:10:46.829
Not only preach it, but model it as
a pastor and most pastors do as well.

00:10:47.099 --> 00:10:47.969
So let's walk through this.

00:10:47.969 --> 00:10:49.770
There's a lot of qualifications, right?

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.750
So the first one we see
here is above reproach.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.089
So above reproach is blameless.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.349
And basically it's saying this, nothing
that Satan or others could hold against

00:10:58.349 --> 00:11:00.060
you or attack you about your character.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.520
Again, when we talk
about this is perfection.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.599
No, but it's probably attaining
or pursuing above approach life.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.680
I'm a husband of one wife, most believers.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.580
You begin to study about this.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.210
He's talking about men who are
not divorced or remarried unless

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.350
the spouse has passed away.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.780
This is also talking about in
the, in the church, you hear

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.950
a lot about multiple wives.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.050
This is also saying, Hey,
it's not multiple wives.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.970
And I always tell people this,
if you're trying to have multiple

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.790
wives, what headache are you
trying to add to your life?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.540
No offense.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.000
I love my wife, but I want one want one.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.610
So maybe it's just him saying, Hey,
it's important to just have one.

00:11:32.194 --> 00:11:35.435
So, you know, I usually get bad
jokes and it's enough that my wife's

00:11:35.435 --> 00:11:36.575
not in here to tell me to stop.

00:11:36.575 --> 00:11:37.685
So I'll just keep going.

00:11:39.555 --> 00:11:43.395
He goes on and he says this, he
says to be self-controlled as well.

00:11:43.725 --> 00:11:47.235
And it's talking about restraint,
exercised over one's impulses

00:11:47.655 --> 00:11:49.125
and emotions and desires.

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.355
And so think about this.

00:11:50.355 --> 00:11:53.565
I think you would want your leaders to
be self-controlled in their emotions.

00:11:53.685 --> 00:11:57.105
Why I've been a pastor long enough
to know this, you will be tested.

00:11:57.525 --> 00:12:01.365
Um, and again, your character
truly shows through, um, when

00:12:01.365 --> 00:12:03.195
you are tested, um, within.

00:12:04.275 --> 00:12:07.454
We see the word sensible, the
word sensible is translated,

00:12:07.454 --> 00:12:08.954
sober and sound mind.

00:12:08.954 --> 00:12:09.194
Right?

00:12:09.194 --> 00:12:12.314
And when you think of sober, you're
thinking not being influenced by

00:12:12.314 --> 00:12:14.025
someone, something or someone.

00:12:14.295 --> 00:12:17.115
And so you have a sound mind to
be able to approach situations.

00:12:17.444 --> 00:12:20.895
He uses the word respectable,
which translates to be orderly,

00:12:20.895 --> 00:12:22.485
organized in his thinking, right?

00:12:22.485 --> 00:12:23.564
Or even the word model.

00:12:24.824 --> 00:12:28.485
He talks about being hospitable, which
is generous and welcoming to guests or

00:12:28.485 --> 00:12:33.405
strangers he's to be able to teach, which
means he spends time studying the word and

00:12:33.405 --> 00:12:35.055
can teach it correctly and accordingly.

00:12:35.415 --> 00:12:37.605
And so before I go on, does
anybody start filling this?

00:12:37.605 --> 00:12:40.365
Being a lot of stuff, an
expectation to attain?

00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:42.255
I do too.

00:12:42.314 --> 00:12:45.585
And I'm the one that's supposed to be
attaining these things as a pastor.

00:12:45.885 --> 00:12:47.955
Um, and so I always tell
people this pray for your path.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:49.829
Encourage your pastor.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:54.390
If you want to see him successful
and the church successful in leaders.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.390
Pray for him and the other
leaders in the church as well.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.660
He goes on in verse three and he talks
about not to be an excessive drinker.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.360
So one of the things we've talked
about as a church is this idea

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.980
behind alcohol is alcohol bad will.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.290
In essence, I'll call
it itself is not bad.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.140
Drunkenness is bad, but for leaders,
when you think about this, there's.

00:13:11.055 --> 00:13:12.795
The example and what this isn't.

00:13:12.795 --> 00:13:14.475
So he says not to be an excessive drinker.

00:13:14.505 --> 00:13:15.464
Well, what does that mean?

00:13:15.975 --> 00:13:19.755
It's honestly, it's saying why
don't play the line of what

00:13:19.755 --> 00:13:21.225
drunkenness is and what isn't.

00:13:21.314 --> 00:13:25.694
And so, as a pastor, they should set the
tone of like, don't try to play the line

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:28.425
of what it is between drunkenness and not.

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:33.135
And many times in this day, whenever
Paul's talking about alcohol, Wine

00:13:33.165 --> 00:13:36.465
was actually added to the water
to make it a little bit healthier.

00:13:36.885 --> 00:13:39.015
And so you would even hear like,
when he's talking about this,

00:13:39.015 --> 00:13:42.495
it's like, don't go excessive in
adding that to your water as well.

00:13:42.645 --> 00:13:45.165
Why so that you have a sound mind, right?

00:13:45.165 --> 00:13:46.425
And so he continues to talk about this.

00:13:46.425 --> 00:13:48.525
He says, to not be a bully, right.

00:13:48.525 --> 00:13:52.125
To not look for fights, not trying
to cause arguments to be gentle.

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:57.225
He says to be patient listening to people,
to be fair, he says not to be quarrelsome,

00:13:57.645 --> 00:13:59.415
which pastors must be peacemakers.

00:13:59.415 --> 00:13:59.745
Right.

00:13:59.745 --> 00:14:00.615
And not troublemakers.

00:14:01.605 --> 00:14:04.125
He talks about this other one, he
says greedy, and I'm going through

00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:06.824
these pretty quickly, but I think
they're, they're pretty logical

00:14:06.824 --> 00:14:09.135
as I'm giving an explanation of
this, he says not to be greedy.

00:14:09.165 --> 00:14:10.844
Why would a pastor not
need to be greeting?

00:14:10.844 --> 00:14:11.944
Well, two, two reasons number.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:17.040
If a pastor's greedy, there's a good
chance that he's influenced by money.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.350
So if there's certain members in
the church, they get more money.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.500
He's probably going to listen to them more
and do what they want because it's money

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.090
or what you might find with the pastor
is people are trying to pay him more.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.400
How we'll pay you so much,
if you'll do what we say.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:29.760
Right.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.540
So greedy means you're not
going to be so focused on money

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.770
that you'll be influenced.

00:14:35.535 --> 00:14:36.435
Negatively.

00:14:36.555 --> 00:14:36.975
Right.

00:14:37.305 --> 00:14:39.945
And so you think about pastors in this,
and so, you know, it's interesting.

00:14:40.515 --> 00:14:45.615
I, uh, basically grew up poor and then
whenever I say poor or not poor, my

00:14:45.615 --> 00:14:48.705
parents took amazing care of me very
well, but I just want to make more

00:14:48.705 --> 00:14:50.145
money than what we had grown up with.

00:14:50.445 --> 00:14:51.645
So I actually got really good.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.820
And was like trying to get an
education so I can make a ton of money.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.060
And it was funny how the Lord
broke my heart and said, ha, you

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.110
won't ever make a lot of money.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.520
You're going to go be a pastor.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.380
And I said, okay, that sounds great.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.950
And so what I say with that is
greediness is something that even

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:07.690
for pastors, they fight with, right.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.180
They battle with, but he says
to not be greedy so that you're

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.500
not influenced and drawn away.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.610
Um, some here's the other side of
it who knows prosperity gospel.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.010
There's also the flip side.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.500
Sometimes pastors will use.

00:15:20.655 --> 00:15:22.905
To try to get rich again.

00:15:22.905 --> 00:15:24.795
That's another way he's
saying don't be greeting.

00:15:25.185 --> 00:15:27.015
Um, it continues on a
verses four and five.

00:15:27.015 --> 00:15:28.755
I want to read these specifically.

00:15:28.755 --> 00:15:33.045
He says he must manage his own household
competently, having his children

00:15:33.045 --> 00:15:34.455
under control with all dignity.

00:15:34.755 --> 00:15:37.935
And if anyone does not know how
to manage his own household, how

00:15:37.935 --> 00:15:39.975
will he take care of God's church?

00:15:40.425 --> 00:15:43.425
So basically what he's saying
about the qualifications of

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:45.125
a pastor is that he should.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.090
Uh, a godly family, right?

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.110
This does not mean that the pastor has
to have a family, but if he does, it's

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.600
saying that a man's own children cannot.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:59.070
Uh, basically, if his man's own
children can not obey him and respect

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.430
him, then his church will likely
not respect nobody's children.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.540
And I'll say this, that means this, that
the pastor needs to prioritize his family.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.920
Um, you'll see.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.770
One of the things that you'll see with
pastors at times is they'll sacrifice

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.240
their family for the sake of the.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:13.240
Right.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.720
For the sake of success of the
ministry, pastors need to prioritize

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.660
their family because if they can't
manage their own household, how can

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.280
they manage to manage the church?

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.020
And so it doesn't mean this.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.030
I mean, I'll just let you
know my kids aren't perfect.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.390
Right.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.360
But I'll, I'll say this, that
we're continuing to work through

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.380
that they're not going to be ones
that don't respect us as parents.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.620
And then I expect to be able
to lead a church in that.

00:16:37.215 --> 00:16:40.335
So he continues on here and he
says this in verse six, that

00:16:40.335 --> 00:16:41.985
there to not be a new believer.

00:16:42.074 --> 00:16:42.944
So I want to ask this question.

00:16:42.944 --> 00:16:46.785
Why, why shouldn't you be a new believer
in leadership, in anything, a new,

00:16:47.055 --> 00:16:49.785
a new person out of college, going
into a major leadership position?

00:16:49.785 --> 00:16:50.115
Why

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:56.204
no experience, right?

00:16:56.204 --> 00:16:57.465
You're you're so new.

00:16:57.465 --> 00:17:01.845
There's odds are you, you have no clue
and how to handle certain situations.

00:17:02.085 --> 00:17:04.635
So a new believer and he even
talks about this in this verse.

00:17:04.635 --> 00:17:05.385
I'm gonna look at it here in.

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:10.319
I says he must not be a new convert
or he might become conceited and

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:13.740
incur the same condemnation as the
devil, which means he may be pulled

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.069
away, teaching false things persuaded.

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:20.790
And so a new believer should give
himself time to study, right.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.460
And learn before he's
placed in that position.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.300
And then he goes into verse seven
and that he should have a good

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.590
testimony outside of the church.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.070
Think about this.

00:17:32.715 --> 00:17:34.635
I don't have a good
Testament, which means this.

00:17:34.635 --> 00:17:38.205
If you don't have a good reputation
outside the church, how can

00:17:38.205 --> 00:17:41.655
you lead a church to reach the
people outside your church?

00:17:42.165 --> 00:17:43.544
So most of these things seem like.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.070
And what did we see with the pastor
as that they need to have a good

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.450
reputation outside the church.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.660
They need to have all these
characteristics, but I'll tell you this.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.530
I had to take a deep breath after I
studied this portion of the text and

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:59.010
I had to go, man, that's a lot of
expectations on me and other pastors

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.920
in your community, and maybe other
churches that you go to the pastors,

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.450
there that's a lot of expectations, but
then I started thinking through this,

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.830
man, if I prioritize my relationship
with Jesus, These are things that should

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.290
come out of the overflow of my life.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.570
These aren't standards,
I'm trying to attain.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.100
They just become who I am.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.600
And what I would also say with this
is if you have a pastor that's not

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.270
meeting every one of these expectations,
number one, give them grace.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.840
Number two, be part of the solution
rather than being critical.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.310
That's just from my perspective,
I'd rather be encouraged to change.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.710
Then to have somebody talking about
me behind my back and calling me out

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.560
behind my back and not approaching
me and saying, Hey, I love you, but

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.640
there's an area of your character.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.560
That's just not godly.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.640
And here's what I would say.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.280
We should be doing that
amongst believers as well.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.980
If we see a character in another
one of a believer in our church

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.760
to say, Hey, there's not a godly
character that we address it together.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.360
So just my challenge to you
is that it's important, right?

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.070
Not only to hold pastors to this, but
us to follow their example in this.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.360
Um, and again, pastors set this
example to try to challenge

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.350
the church, to lead it out.

00:19:08.129 --> 00:19:10.410
I want to share just a few
things with your leaders lead

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.410
and set the example many times.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.410
It's not even in perfection, but
it's in pursuit of these things,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.190
but all of these things lived out
in the life of pastor helps him

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.720
avoid being persuaded by the enemy.

00:19:22.665 --> 00:19:25.905
Paul is teaching Timothy
to address false teaching.

00:19:25.905 --> 00:19:30.675
So he is saying in this, if you'll appoint
leaders that have these characteristics,

00:19:31.034 --> 00:19:34.665
they will not be persuaded by the
enemy to teach false teachings.

00:19:34.665 --> 00:19:35.084
Right.

00:19:36.195 --> 00:19:38.475
And being a hypocrite with
what they're saying right.

00:19:38.475 --> 00:19:40.064
And saying one thing to do in another.

00:19:40.695 --> 00:19:43.635
And he talks about it being a noble work,
not to be, take a grain of for right.

00:19:43.635 --> 00:19:45.975
And that's why a pastor
should be appointed slowly.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.130
But I would also say this
character determines position.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.000
If a person aspires for a
position, it should be out of the

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.320
overflow of their faith, right?

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.490
The relationship with Christ, rather
than them attaining the position by just

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.720
trying to attain those characteristics,
it's a different, I'm telling you, it's

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.460
a different perspective and this is why
leadership should be taken serious when

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.050
it comes to the church and hope that.

00:20:11.205 --> 00:20:11.564
Right.

00:20:11.865 --> 00:20:13.665
So let's look at the
deacon side of things.

00:20:13.665 --> 00:20:17.024
And again, today I told you information
a little bit more than anything.

00:20:17.475 --> 00:20:19.784
So we see that qualifications
for leaders in the.

00:20:20.775 --> 00:20:22.635
All these things that they're
held to a standard so that they

00:20:22.635 --> 00:20:26.145
can set the example and then lead
a church to follow that example.

00:20:26.145 --> 00:20:30.555
Again, they're pointing back to Christ as
well, but in order for pastors to do that,

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:32.625
they have other leaders in the church.

00:20:32.685 --> 00:20:34.935
And you'll hear this back in the
old or not the old Testament, but

00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:36.825
in the new Testament of deacons.

00:20:36.825 --> 00:20:37.155
Right.

00:20:37.155 --> 00:20:38.235
And so what are deacons?

00:20:38.235 --> 00:20:39.615
Deacons are servant leaders.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:44.919
There are people who typically serve
alongside the pastor to do some of the

00:20:44.919 --> 00:20:48.669
other ministry work so that pastors
can minister in the word and prayer

00:20:48.669 --> 00:20:52.540
consistently so that they can't focus
on the truth so that they can prevent

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.480
false teaching to come in so that they
can raise up leaders and equip the

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.649
saints for the work of the ministry.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.629
So deacons play an important role.

00:20:58.929 --> 00:21:02.560
So something we'll talk about in
two weeks does inspiring hope have.

00:21:04.175 --> 00:21:07.355
Technically with the title, no future.

00:21:07.385 --> 00:21:07.925
Yes.

00:21:08.105 --> 00:21:10.865
Do some of our people in our church,
on our leadership team already

00:21:10.865 --> 00:21:12.215
really functioned in that faction.

00:21:12.485 --> 00:21:15.635
Absolutely doesn't mean that they're
not important doesn't mean because they

00:21:15.635 --> 00:21:18.215
don't have a title of deacon doesn't
mean they're not important, but I would

00:21:18.215 --> 00:21:23.465
say this, it takes a group of people
so that the church can be successful

00:21:23.465 --> 00:21:24.515
in the mission that God's called.

00:21:25.274 --> 00:21:29.024
So that we can, again, reach people,
help them experience the hope of

00:21:29.024 --> 00:21:30.825
the gospel and protect the message.

00:21:31.064 --> 00:21:32.865
Again, the truth of the message in this.

00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:38.235
So deacon is an important role, and I
want to read this text out of acts to

00:21:38.235 --> 00:21:39.885
kind of talk about the important role.

00:21:39.885 --> 00:21:42.885
So acts chapter six, if you want
to pull over there, you can, but

00:21:42.885 --> 00:21:44.445
we also will have it on the screen.

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:49.175
Um, acts chapter six is where you'll start
hearing where the apostles appointed.

00:21:50.129 --> 00:21:50.790
Deacons.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.020
And it was so cool.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.560
I actually was reading over this text
with Joe and Kristin, cause I meet with

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.320
them on Tuesday nights and do a little
bit of a discipleship meeting with them.

00:21:58.649 --> 00:22:01.500
And we got on this text and it was so cool
because we got to talk about this when we

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.790
were coming to talk about it this Sunday.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.360
So it says this and this first
seven verses speaking of deacons

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.030
as this, in those days of the
disciples were increasing in.

00:22:09.985 --> 00:22:13.795
There arose a complaint by the
Hellenistic Jews against the Hebrew

00:22:13.795 --> 00:22:17.875
Anik Jews that their widows were being
overlooked in the daily distribution.

00:22:17.875 --> 00:22:20.125
Again, they were getting food because
there were widows, they were being taken

00:22:20.125 --> 00:22:23.095
care of, but it says the 12 summit.

00:22:23.095 --> 00:22:26.545
And so this is the 12 apostles at that
time, after they had followed Jesus,

00:22:27.205 --> 00:22:30.295
it says they summoned the 12 and the
whole company of disciples and said it

00:22:30.295 --> 00:22:34.255
would not be right for us to give up
preaching of the word to wait on tables.

00:22:34.585 --> 00:22:37.015
Not because they were above
it, just so you know, pastors

00:22:37.015 --> 00:22:38.695
are not above washing floors.

00:22:39.615 --> 00:22:40.875
I don't mind cleaning bathrooms.

00:22:40.875 --> 00:22:42.165
I don't mind serving people.

00:22:42.215 --> 00:22:44.055
And I think every pastor should do that.

00:22:44.415 --> 00:22:46.995
So these guys aren't saying we're
above that, but what they're saying is

00:22:47.025 --> 00:22:51.465
in our role, the most important thing
is preaching of the word is prayer.

00:22:51.885 --> 00:22:54.975
And so he continues to go on here and he
says, brothers and sisters select from

00:22:54.975 --> 00:22:59.865
among you seven men of good reputation
full of the spirit and of wisdom who can

00:22:59.865 --> 00:23:04.125
appoint this duty, but we will devote
ourselves to prayer and the ministry of.

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.510
And this proposal pleased
the whole company.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.780
And so they chose Steve and
Amanda full of faith, the holy

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.570
spirit and Philip, um, pro chorus.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.170
These are always great
names named Kaurna tymone.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.590
I said to Mona Puma, but it's not
pimp poom, but it's par minibus,

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.290
Nicholas, and the convert from Antioch.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.020
And they had them stand before
the apostles who prayed and

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.010
laid their hands on them.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.550
And so this is my favorite part
when they appointed deacons

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.050
to help them serve the church.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:33.870
It says in verse seven.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:38.130
So the word of God spread and the
disciples in Jerusalem increased in

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:43.110
number and the group grew larger and a
priest who became obedient to the faith

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:47.790
think about this because leadership is
shared in the church because it's not

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:52.260
all only on the pastors and the leaders
so that the pastors and leaders can set

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.120
the example through ministry and prayer.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.540
So through the word and prayer,
if they can focus more time on

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.950
that, that protects the church.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:04.020
Right from false teachers
being able to lead effectively.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.040
And as we talk about an Ephesians four
to equip the saints for the work, the

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.310
ministry, this allows deacons who with
their gifting can go and serve the

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.530
church and meet the needs in the church.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:17.430
And it takes all of us and something
we're going to get to talk about

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.940
again in two weeks and even more so
is it's more than just pastors and

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.630
deacons that have a responsibility
to church to help fulfill its cause.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.520
Excuse me, to fill the
mission in the church.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.860
So deacons are very, very important.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.149
So I wanted to share all that with
you to see how important that is,

00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:35.280
but I want to talk about their
qualifications pretty quick here.

00:24:35.879 --> 00:24:38.940
So even though deacons are not
given the same authority as elders,

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:42.990
they have qualifications again,
an expectation to set an example.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:47.100
So it says this, it says deacons
must be worthy of respect,

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.120
talks about in verse eight.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.010
So what is worthy of respect?

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:52.110
Great character worth.

00:24:53.205 --> 00:24:57.525
One who takes this position
serious and is responsible.

00:24:57.945 --> 00:24:59.265
He says, he's not hypocritical.

00:24:59.265 --> 00:25:03.075
And I I'm telling you, you hear a lot of
things about people should be something,

00:25:03.495 --> 00:25:07.005
but I think it's important to hear that
they should not be something light.

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:10.605
So these are things where it's like, don't
be this person, don't be this person.

00:25:10.935 --> 00:25:13.935
Um, and I think more of us probably
need to hear that at times.

00:25:14.385 --> 00:25:16.275
Um, but he says not to be hypocritical.

00:25:16.635 --> 00:25:18.135
Um, he is not a gossiper.

00:25:18.315 --> 00:25:20.835
Doesn't do one thing
and say another, right.

00:25:20.865 --> 00:25:21.255
He can be.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.390
It uses here as well for Deakins
not to drink a lot of wine, again,

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.240
the same thing for the pastors,
not to be greedy for money.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.000
Most people, if you know,
deacons and a church, typically

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.080
deacons count the offering.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.210
But in this instance they
were dispersing food.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.990
They most likely would have been over
some form of disbursement of money.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.820
And because of that, they
couldn't be greeted with.

00:25:40.695 --> 00:25:44.895
Because they might be tempted to
still money or to change something.

00:25:45.165 --> 00:25:47.415
Um, that would be, um,
if they were gradient.

00:25:47.415 --> 00:25:49.965
So this is why it's important
for them to have this, to have

00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:50.955
a solid, biblical understand.

00:25:50.955 --> 00:25:51.795
This is what verse nine says.

00:25:51.795 --> 00:25:52.725
I want to read verse nine.

00:25:53.235 --> 00:25:54.675
I've got to go back to my text.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.780
It says this in verse nine, it says I'm
holding the mystery of the faith with a

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.360
clear conscience, with a clear conscience.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.110
And so having that solid biblical
understanding of the truth of the gospel

00:26:07.379 --> 00:26:10.530
so that whenever they are living it
out, they have a clear understanding and

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.110
whenever they are modeling it as well.

00:26:13.469 --> 00:26:17.639
So verse 10 talks about that they
should be tested and prove themselves.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:21.899
Is anybody ever been to a deacon
ordination ordination typically?

00:26:22.695 --> 00:26:27.075
What will happen at some point, his
deacons will be somewhat tested, right?

00:26:27.075 --> 00:26:29.535
They'll bring him before the church
and they'll say, Hey, you know,

00:26:29.535 --> 00:26:31.695
we're presenting this person as a
deacon in the next couple weeks.

00:26:31.725 --> 00:26:35.565
If you have anything against them, if
there's anything that we should know of,

00:26:35.745 --> 00:26:37.275
that this person should become a deacon.

00:26:37.335 --> 00:26:37.995
Let us know.

00:26:38.325 --> 00:26:41.955
Typically what that's saying is we've
been watching him for a while and he

00:26:41.955 --> 00:26:45.195
meets the qualifications, but we're
going to give everybody an opportunity.

00:26:45.195 --> 00:26:47.145
If there's a reason why
this person wouldn't have.

00:26:48.015 --> 00:26:49.065
Meet that expectation.

00:26:49.065 --> 00:26:52.065
So they're tested for a time to
see if they could prove themselves

00:26:52.185 --> 00:26:53.415
to be worthy of the position.

00:26:53.805 --> 00:26:54.885
And I always think of this.

00:26:55.395 --> 00:26:57.195
This is why it's important
with these certain roles.

00:26:57.195 --> 00:27:00.795
Not to just rush people into leadership
because you need them, but that

00:27:00.795 --> 00:27:02.865
you should test them for a time.

00:27:03.585 --> 00:27:05.505
Then it get jumps into verses 11 and 12.

00:27:05.505 --> 00:27:07.335
And this is where it includes
the wives of deacons.

00:27:08.025 --> 00:27:08.985
It says wives too.

00:27:08.985 --> 00:27:13.455
Must be worthy of respect, not slanderous,
or self-controlled faithful in.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.530
So let's talk about the
whys for a second here.

00:27:16.919 --> 00:27:17.580
It's interesting.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.470
When you begin to study this, and
I'm not going to jump off into

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.700
this too much, but it talks about
the qualifications of an elder.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.220
You hear about the family, but you
don't hear much about the wife,

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.879
but you hear more in this instance
about the wife with the deacon.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.520
I believe Paul's kind
of setting up this idea.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.860
And again, as I begin to study
about this, that the idea

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.629
behind the importance of deacon.

00:27:37.845 --> 00:27:41.025
With their wife, if they have one
to serve together in this role.

00:27:41.175 --> 00:27:41.565
Yes.

00:27:41.595 --> 00:27:42.225
Men lead.

00:27:42.225 --> 00:27:43.635
And we talked about this
a couple of weeks ago.

00:27:43.845 --> 00:27:48.135
Men set the example in the home men set
the example in the church, but women

00:27:48.135 --> 00:27:49.575
are an important role in the church.

00:27:49.575 --> 00:27:53.565
And obviously as a deacon plays
such an important role, why does

00:27:53.565 --> 00:27:56.115
her character need to be well?

00:27:56.295 --> 00:27:58.695
Because she has an
important role in model.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:03.540
What following Jesus and also helping
serve the church in this role.

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.960
So we also, you know, again, that's
just something, I think that's important

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.020
as he's talking about women and he
says this, he says that if it's a

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.890
deacon of a wife should be worthy
of respect and great character worth

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:18.270
imitating, just like her husband, not
slanderous making false statements

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.480
or a gossiper self-controlled right.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.140
Restraint exercise over her
impulses, emotions and desires.

00:28:25.935 --> 00:28:27.465
And then faithful and everything.

00:28:27.465 --> 00:28:29.745
And that's a big statement, but
faithful, meaning just remaining

00:28:29.745 --> 00:28:31.545
loyal and steadfast in her position.

00:28:32.895 --> 00:28:36.795
Um, then it comes back to the husbands
again in verse 12, where it talks

00:28:36.795 --> 00:28:40.305
about husbands of one wife, again,
similar to the pastors as well.

00:28:40.305 --> 00:28:41.295
We talked about that.

00:28:41.655 --> 00:28:45.135
And then the last verse in verse
13, he talks about serving well,

00:28:45.195 --> 00:28:46.095
and I want to talk about that.

00:28:46.095 --> 00:28:50.055
He says for those who have served well
as deacons acquire a good standing

00:28:50.055 --> 00:28:53.925
for themselves and great boldness
in the faith that is in Christ.

00:28:53.925 --> 00:28:54.105
Jesus.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:59.430
Think about this, if a deacon serves well
in his role, he's grown up in his face.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.050
He is basically setting a great
example for those around him.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:08.669
He's modeling Christ and many believed
that as even if you go back to acts

00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:13.230
chapter six, you'll see Stephen who was
a deacon actually very quickly after

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.300
was out preaching the gospel boldly.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.100
He ended up dying for his faith.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.959
And so, because he was bold in his
position and he was confident in his

00:29:20.969 --> 00:29:25.560
position and he did it well, he not only
set an example, but he actually even rose.

00:29:26.189 --> 00:29:28.950
Uh, what I would say, a leadership
position and being able to be

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.389
more effective for the gospel.

00:29:31.139 --> 00:29:35.070
And so coming back to this deacons play
an important role in the church, right?

00:29:35.129 --> 00:29:38.879
To allow pastors to minister in the word
and prayer so that they can spiritually

00:29:38.879 --> 00:29:41.820
address the false teaching and equip
saints for the work of the ministry,

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.530
rather than just doing it all themselves.

00:29:44.594 --> 00:29:45.705
Lots of information.

00:29:45.885 --> 00:29:49.334
I didn't want to go any more deeper
because you guys are probably like done

00:29:49.334 --> 00:29:51.284
with the 16 qualifications for pastors.

00:29:51.284 --> 00:29:53.145
And I don't even know
how many for deacons.

00:29:53.804 --> 00:29:55.485
Why is it important?

00:29:55.695 --> 00:29:56.925
I want you, I want you
to ask this question.

00:29:56.955 --> 00:30:01.544
Why is it important for us to know
as a church, the, the qualifications

00:30:01.544 --> 00:30:04.485
for elders and pastors, and also for
deacons, I'm going to ask that question.

00:30:04.485 --> 00:30:07.995
Why do you think it's important
for you, for us the church to

00:30:07.995 --> 00:30:11.985
know the qualifications for
elders and pastors and deacons?

00:30:12.794 --> 00:30:13.064
Why is it.

00:30:16.675 --> 00:30:17.215
Absolutely.

00:30:17.814 --> 00:30:18.564
Yeah, that's good.

00:30:18.564 --> 00:30:19.195
What else?

00:30:20.365 --> 00:30:20.995
Countability?

00:30:20.995 --> 00:30:21.745
That's good.

00:30:22.645 --> 00:30:23.064
There's two.

00:30:23.064 --> 00:30:23.754
Let's keep going.

00:30:29.605 --> 00:30:30.175
It's good.

00:30:30.205 --> 00:30:30.774
It's another one.

00:30:30.895 --> 00:30:31.495
Let's keep going.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:34.860
How to appoint them.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.409
See, I think that's another good one,
because again, the church we're talking

00:30:37.409 --> 00:30:41.129
about points elders, and he's talking to
Timothy, but the church is a part of this.

00:30:41.129 --> 00:30:43.770
And so you guys know, we talk
about it in the future about

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:44.850
appointing elders and deacons.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:48.210
You know what characteristics to go to,
if you're hearing to say, Hey, so-and-so

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.760
you guys can pull, open your Bible
and literally come back to here now.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:55.530
Cause you've heard it and go, you know,
I want to know, or here's another one

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:56.550
I'm gonna, I'm gonna bring this one up.

00:30:57.149 --> 00:30:57.840
I'm praying.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.060
God's stirring the hearts of
some of our people in our church.

00:31:00.735 --> 00:31:04.695
They're thinking, you know, I think God
may be calling me to be an elder pastor.

00:31:04.695 --> 00:31:06.794
I think God may be calling
me to be a deacon in the.

00:31:07.889 --> 00:31:11.100
And I want you to be thinking,
man, it does my life reflect this.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.800
Maybe God's drawn you to it and
your life doesn't reflect it.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.649
And what, what's your next step
in that your next step could be?

00:31:16.919 --> 00:31:19.649
I mean, I'm just going to begin to pour
myself into my relationship with Jesus

00:31:19.889 --> 00:31:21.149
as these characteristics come through.

00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:25.169
So I think there's lots of reasons
specifically here for us as we look

00:31:25.169 --> 00:31:26.939
and see why it was so important.

00:31:26.939 --> 00:31:30.750
Leadership is important to make
sure that the message of the gospel.

00:31:31.514 --> 00:31:33.645
Is taken well care of that.

00:31:33.645 --> 00:31:35.715
It is not twisted, right?

00:31:35.715 --> 00:31:38.175
It is so that the pastors
can focus on the word.

00:31:38.804 --> 00:31:42.315
And so before we move on, I'm
going to kind of close today.

00:31:42.435 --> 00:31:43.544
I want to ask this question.

00:31:43.605 --> 00:31:45.915
Many of you have been in churches
with deacons before, right?

00:31:45.915 --> 00:31:47.175
Anybody been in church with deacons.

00:31:48.615 --> 00:31:50.715
What do deacons typically
do in your church?

00:31:50.745 --> 00:31:52.635
I know it's different from each church,
but I want to ask that question.

00:31:52.635 --> 00:31:54.075
What did he can stipulate
do in your church

00:31:57.985 --> 00:31:59.655
by answering you're actually
just helping us out.

00:31:59.655 --> 00:32:00.264
I want to know.

00:32:03.045 --> 00:32:03.405
Okay.

00:32:04.965 --> 00:32:05.835
Visit the sick, okay.

00:32:09.175 --> 00:32:10.435
Minister, the widow's great.

00:32:13.535 --> 00:32:13.925
Anybody else?

00:32:18.885 --> 00:32:20.535
Maybe you don't have experience
with Deakins and that's fine.

00:32:20.535 --> 00:32:22.905
I think at each church it can be
a little bit different, right?

00:32:23.265 --> 00:32:24.615
For some it's usually pretty consistent.

00:32:24.615 --> 00:32:25.785
They help with communion.

00:32:25.785 --> 00:32:27.135
They usually help with the offering.

00:32:27.525 --> 00:32:30.435
They're going to usually
help with benevolence or the

00:32:30.435 --> 00:32:31.365
widows and things like that.

00:32:31.365 --> 00:32:33.254
And that's typically some roles
you'll see the deacons play.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.890
Uh, and the Bible as well, but I believe
deacons can actually play a, even more

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.130
considerable role because if you look
at that, they're continually removing

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:42.810
the burdens that are on the pastor.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:46.380
That's outside of the word and prayer
so that the pastors can focus on that.

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:50.250
Um, and so that's something that I
think each church has to work together

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:54.450
to define the specific role and
need for the deacon in the church.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:55.260
So.

00:32:56.294 --> 00:33:00.075
As we kind of conclude today and
talk about like, what, what is our

00:33:00.075 --> 00:33:01.725
take-homes, what does this mean to us?

00:33:01.935 --> 00:33:04.034
I know we have so many guests
and I'm hoping that some of this

00:33:04.034 --> 00:33:05.115
information was good for you.

00:33:05.534 --> 00:33:08.804
Um, again, focusing more on information
than application today, and we're going

00:33:08.804 --> 00:33:11.415
to continue to talk more about that in
a couple of weeks specifically, we'll

00:33:11.415 --> 00:33:14.685
go, I think a little bit deeper for each
one of us that will, this may draw out

00:33:14.685 --> 00:33:16.845
a little bit more, um, for each one.

00:33:17.715 --> 00:33:20.835
But what I would say is our take
home for each one of us today.

00:33:21.215 --> 00:33:25.515
And I think we should not miss this number
one, seeing the need for leadership.

00:33:25.545 --> 00:33:25.905
Yes.

00:33:25.905 --> 00:33:32.595
Leadership in the church is important,
but I want to mention this thing if it's

00:33:32.595 --> 00:33:36.645
so important to set up leadership in the
church, it's because the, the message

00:33:36.645 --> 00:33:41.505
that we have as a church is so important
to protect the message of the gospel.

00:33:42.105 --> 00:33:42.735
And if you've been.

00:33:43.665 --> 00:33:45.014
Having your eyes open at all.

00:33:45.014 --> 00:33:49.125
You know, that message gets twisted
over time and over time and over time.

00:33:49.155 --> 00:33:52.095
Why, why do you believe the
message of the gospel gets twisted

00:33:56.745 --> 00:33:57.675
people's ideas?

00:33:58.155 --> 00:34:02.325
So they're appointing leaders that are
probably not meeting the qualifications

00:34:03.585 --> 00:34:07.725
that are not keeping the gospel
message pure because they are getting

00:34:07.815 --> 00:34:11.295
more distracted with everything
outside of the message of the word.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:14.940
I mean, this is simple as that, right?

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:18.810
I mean, thing, I always say this it's
just on the church go to any company

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:22.139
organization that ends up tanking.

00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:25.199
They appointed the wrong leader
because that leader did not make

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:27.839
the main thing, the main thing, the
right thing, the right thing, the

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:29.460
gospel needs to be the main thing.

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:30.929
Jesus needs to be the main thing.

00:34:32.175 --> 00:34:33.585
I would say that it is important.

00:34:33.585 --> 00:34:34.965
This message is so important.

00:34:34.965 --> 00:34:38.475
So today I hope that he's one
of us sees the important role.

00:34:38.505 --> 00:34:42.375
Each leader plays in the church to protect
the message of the gospel and to make

00:34:42.375 --> 00:34:44.625
sure that the word is preached and taught.

00:34:44.895 --> 00:34:49.605
Truthfully, number two is
important for us to know the

00:34:49.605 --> 00:34:50.985
expectations of leaders, right?

00:34:50.985 --> 00:34:54.795
And the not only in the importance in
the church, but I would even say for

00:34:54.795 --> 00:34:58.815
you to pray for them specifically, like
Laura said, number one for some in this

00:34:58.815 --> 00:34:59.925
room, and this is the third one I want.

00:35:00.705 --> 00:35:02.075
For some in this room to ask.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.000
Could God be calling me to that
position or that role in the future.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.700
And maybe it's not now, but
it may be in the future.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.880
And so you're saying, Hey, I want to be
a part of, if you think about servant

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.509
leader, removing some of the burdens
from the pastor men, I want to aspire

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:20.040
to be, and it's a noble work to be
a deacon, or man, God may be calling

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.770
me because these characteristics are
starting to become part of my life.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.410
And I want to be a part of
leading the church spiritually

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:26.280
through the word and prayer.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.500
So I hope that the Lord may be
drawing some of you to ask that

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.360
question to take a next step in that.

00:35:31.355 --> 00:35:34.895
And then for the last is, uh, to again,
know that the, the, again, the, the

00:35:34.895 --> 00:35:40.025
function of the church and its success is
not only on these two roles in the church.

00:35:40.025 --> 00:35:43.445
And I know we didn't talk much about
it today, but I mentioned it if all the

00:35:43.445 --> 00:35:49.205
pressures on me and our future deacons, or
whoever's maybe leading that role without

00:35:49.205 --> 00:35:54.395
a title that cannot be the only people
that are bearing this weight, because

00:35:54.395 --> 00:35:55.525
that's not what God's called us to.

00:35:56.325 --> 00:35:59.984
And that's why I want to talk more and
more as a church going forward as the

00:35:59.984 --> 00:36:05.145
role of the church outside of those two
positions, we have an important role.

00:36:05.174 --> 00:36:05.745
Yes.

00:36:06.285 --> 00:36:09.915
But it says that we are to
equip the saints believers for

00:36:09.915 --> 00:36:14.115
the work of the ministry, which
means all of us have a gift.

00:36:14.805 --> 00:36:17.984
And I want to talk more about what gifts
are and how we apply them and how we

00:36:17.984 --> 00:36:22.125
get involved in fulfilling the mission
that God has called us all to share the

00:36:22.125 --> 00:36:25.515
message of the gospel with others so that
they can experience the hope of Jesus.

00:36:26.339 --> 00:36:30.359
So this message was so important that they
needed to appoint leaders to protect it.

00:36:30.629 --> 00:36:31.740
So I want to end with that.

00:36:32.009 --> 00:36:35.430
There may be people in this room that
are saying, what are you talking about?

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.279
What message God's never changed my life.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.029
Well, I'll tell you this.

00:36:39.029 --> 00:36:42.779
There's a group of people in here in
this room that God has so transformed

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:46.560
that we come not only every week,
but every day to live our faith

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.970
out, because God is so changed.

00:36:49.125 --> 00:36:53.444
Through his son, Jesus, because we
were broken because apart from God

00:36:53.505 --> 00:36:56.745
sickness and Jesus, we would have never
been saved and had an opportunity to

00:36:56.745 --> 00:36:58.455
spend a heaven in eternity, in heaven.

00:36:58.605 --> 00:37:01.904
But also we would also not
be able to remove the burdens

00:37:01.904 --> 00:37:02.924
that we have in our life.

00:37:02.955 --> 00:37:06.645
I'm telling you this, apart from
Christ, I'm falling short, every single.

00:37:07.885 --> 00:37:10.615
And it is difficult in this world
going forward, guys, it's just seems

00:37:10.615 --> 00:37:13.975
like it's only getting more difficult
and I am so thankful that today I

00:37:13.975 --> 00:37:16.225
have Christ that has changed my life.

00:37:16.225 --> 00:37:19.165
And given me hope, gives me grace
and mercy and love every day.

00:37:20.155 --> 00:37:22.795
And that is the message that
each one of us come every week

00:37:22.795 --> 00:37:25.825
to celebrate, learn more, about
to go out and share with others.

00:37:26.685 --> 00:37:29.625
So, if you don't know Christ, if you've
never given your life to Christ, if you

00:37:29.625 --> 00:37:32.865
don't even know what it means to follow
Jesus, that could be your next step.

00:37:33.045 --> 00:37:35.924
This message that leaders are
here appointed to protect.

00:37:36.165 --> 00:37:38.865
That may be something that
you need to experience today.

00:37:39.194 --> 00:37:41.325
So if you've never given your
life to Jesus, I would love for

00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:42.464
you to talk to me after service.

00:37:42.464 --> 00:37:45.795
Whenever we conclude service, you come
find me and say, Hey, I have questions.

00:37:46.095 --> 00:37:48.464
It may not be where you're ready
to give your life to Christ, but

00:37:48.464 --> 00:37:51.105
it may be just another question
that gets you closer to that.

00:37:51.404 --> 00:37:53.325
My challenges today do not leave before.

00:37:54.029 --> 00:37:57.750
You answer those questions before
you figure out why do they even

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:01.620
care so much to meet every week to
talk about the gospel about Jesus.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.440
And I hope to be able to share with you
the life change that God has changed

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:06.210
my life and many people in this church.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.960
And the reason why we continue
every week towards that path.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.140
So this leadership stuff may not
mean much to you, but I pray to

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.890
that message that we are trying to
protect as leaders means a lot to you.

00:38:17.399 --> 00:38:20.730
So as we conclude today and take
time of invitation, I want him to

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.259
just mention this time of invitation.

00:38:22.259 --> 00:38:25.140
I explained it every week because
I do not want people to miss

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.060
this invitation is for everybody.

00:38:27.089 --> 00:38:30.870
It's a simple statement, meaning
we're inviting you to ask God,

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.609
what has he taught you today?

00:38:32.609 --> 00:38:33.470
What has he brought up in your.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.480
That you need to take a next
step in for some of you.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.720
That's the next step in your faith
to know Jesus for some of you that

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.770
may be to take a next step in baptism
for some of you that could be a next

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:45.360
step in leadership for some of you.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.330
That could be a next step and just
spending time with Jesus every day,

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:49.530
because you haven't been doing that.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.110
I don't know what it is, but I know this.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.150
I know God is putting on the
hearts of each one of you.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:57.930
What that should be so invitations
a time to take time and say,

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:01.705
God, 'cause I'll tell you this.

00:39:02.005 --> 00:39:03.924
As soon as we get down here today,
you're going to rush out the

00:39:03.924 --> 00:39:05.185
store to the next test you had.

00:39:05.185 --> 00:39:07.165
This is the moment to sit
there still and say, God.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.750
Don't miss that opportunity
to say, God, here I am.

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:13.640
What is it that I need
to take a next step in?

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:15.410
And I pray that he reveals that to you.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:18.290
And if you have questions, you
want to talk with me during this

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.570
time of invitation, I will be in
the back because I would love to

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:22.790
talk to you about that as well.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.190
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.490
We're so thankful for you, Lord.

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:30.680
We're so thankful for your word, even
though today, Lord is so much information

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:35.240
about how Lord leaders should be qualified
for the position in which they have.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.140
Lord, I pray.

00:39:37.695 --> 00:39:40.065
Um, that one, it taught us something.

00:39:40.335 --> 00:39:44.555
Lord, I pray that, um, if it didn't
teach us anything, because it maybe just

00:39:44.565 --> 00:39:47.535
confused us a little bit, Lord, I pray
that you begin to unconfuse us Lord and

00:39:47.535 --> 00:39:50.115
help us understand, um, their roles.

00:39:51.045 --> 00:39:54.465
Lord, I also just pray that,
that we all don't miss this one.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:02.940
Important statement and the whole
process, the everything we do is

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:08.070
to point people back to you because
you are the one that gives hope.

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.850
You're the one that gives grace and
mercy and forgiveness of our sins.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:15.120
You're the one that will walk through
us in the difficult times and in the

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:19.140
great times, you're the one that will
provide for us, or you're the one

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:23.100
that gives us a family and friends,
Lord to support us and our daily walk.

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:25.440
Or you're the one that changes our life.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:32.790
And that message is so important
that you want to appoint leaders who

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:36.600
have the correct character to keep
that message pure and truthful so

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.890
that other people can experience it.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.060
So, Lord, I pray if there's a
person in this room, Lord, that

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.820
didn't know that before Lord, I pray
that they walk out of here today.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:47.130
And if they go back to another church
that they attend, Lord, they'll

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:50.009
appreciate their pastor or their leader
even more because of that message

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.860
and that characteristics that alert,
learned that they're held to as a.

00:40:53.895 --> 00:40:54.105
Lord.

00:40:54.105 --> 00:40:57.915
I pray that if there's a person that's
room, Lord, that aspires to be a

00:40:57.915 --> 00:41:03.075
leader or that you begin to work up
in their heart to follow you more,

00:41:03.555 --> 00:41:06.705
to meet those, uh, characteristics,
Lord, and begin to discuss that

00:41:06.705 --> 00:41:09.255
with me, Lord and taking those next
steps in that leadership position.

00:41:09.945 --> 00:41:14.175
But Lord, honestly, in the end, I want
all of us to just take a next step in

00:41:14.175 --> 00:41:19.245
our faith, whatever it is to know you,
to be baptized, to take a step of faith

00:41:19.245 --> 00:41:20.595
that just walking daily with you and the.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.460
To go in and telling
somebody about it today.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:27.120
Whenever they, they leave here about
who you are, Lord it challenges

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.630
all to take that next step, because
on the other side of that next

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:33.720
step is a person waiting for us.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.450
Lord, let us not leave
them waiting anymore.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.370
Let us say yes to you.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:40.380
We pray this in your hemline name.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.250
Amen.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:41.810
Amen.
