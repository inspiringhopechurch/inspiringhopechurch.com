00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.320
for us today we're going to be in&nbsp;
the book of luke chapter two keys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.920
are in somewhere i think back in my pocket and&nbsp;
my coat over here in front of the black table

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.680
um anyway so we will begin luke chapter 2 starting&nbsp;
in verse 25. we have been walking through this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.040
season of christmas um basically talking about&nbsp;
the season of praise the season of praise and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200
we got this from the multiple songs&nbsp;
that you'll find in the the book of luke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.440
where there's different people who praise god&nbsp;
for what god was going to do through christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.320
coming to this earth and so as we walked through&nbsp;
that one of the things that we realized in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.320
season of christmas is we spend a lot of time&nbsp;
at christmas and i actually heard somebody say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:03.280
this morning busy can anybody witness that busy&nbsp;
we're either busy shopping planning cleaning uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.480
something somebody named something else what&nbsp;
baking yes going to parties you name it right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.920
and so at the end of all of it we tend to be&nbsp;
exhausted and it's like we love christmas um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.520
and then we're kind of get through it we're like&nbsp;
oh in a way you almost like take a deep breath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.160
well i think there's a different&nbsp;
way to look at christmas than to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.040
like overwhelmed and sometimes distracted by&nbsp;
those things and so you know i love christmas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.520
um i love everything about it which means this&nbsp;
we don't get rid of tradition or we don't get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.760
rid of the baking we actually enjoy all that&nbsp;
but there's a way to enjoy that by also making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.360
the most important thing the most&nbsp;
important thing which is christmas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.640
and i heard this statement the other day and it&nbsp;
made me really think about this and it made sense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.600
having christmas without christ is like&nbsp;
having a birthday without the birthday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.480
boy does that make sense having christmas&nbsp;
without christ is like having a birthday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.560
without the birthday boy we just celebrated&nbsp;
teagan's birthday my daughter tegan is eight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.640
we celebrated her birthday earlier this week and&nbsp;
she was eight and we were celebrating that with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.000
a couple other friends that she had at great wolf&nbsp;
lodge and i started thinking through this you if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.840
you've been to great watch anybody been a great&nbsp;
with lodge here locally it's great place to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.840
to i could have imagined myself having fun without&nbsp;
her present she's not in here but you know i could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.200
have had fun me and brittany could have literally&nbsp;
went there and had fun at this place without her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.760
but it would have been pretty funny if we&nbsp;
were going there purposely for her birthday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.840
and she was never present we would have put the&nbsp;
candles in the birthday cake and we would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.760
lit them and she would have been there to blow&nbsp;
them out but you know who cares we had fun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.160
so so hear what i'm trying to say about this&nbsp;
season we can have the season of christmas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.000
i love everything about christmas but we can't&nbsp;
forget the season is about christ and why he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.680
came so you heard about the christmas&nbsp;
program the children's christmas program&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.160
they got to talk about what is the season&nbsp;
it's a season of celebrating christ's birth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.440
and so we're going to continue to talk that talk&nbsp;
through that this week as we conclude this series&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.520
over the season of praise but i want to kind&nbsp;
of catch you up we've spent walking through a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.720
couple of different um people who had praised&nbsp;
jesus and one of those was mary that was two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.200
weeks ago mary praised jesus whenever she had&nbsp;
realized that she was pregnant with god's son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.760
and she praised jesus because she&nbsp;
recognized what god had done for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.480
what god had done for her people and what god&nbsp;
had actually done for everybody and so she had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.880
the opportunity to praise god in that moment&nbsp;
knowing what god was doing through the birth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.760
of jesus but then we moved to last week and we got&nbsp;
to see the angels praise and that was one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.240
coolest things you see these three little sweet&nbsp;
little girls up here right glory to god in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.880
highest like that's the sweetest thing ever&nbsp;
right so i started imagining today as i seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.520
those three girls say glory to god in the highest&nbsp;
these angels came to some shepherds in the field&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.200
and they said glory to god in the highest right&nbsp;
peace has been brought to earth through jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.920
and here's what we learned because of the&nbsp;
angel's praise it caused the shepherds to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.200
three things that caused the shepherds to go&nbsp;
see jesus it caused the shepherds to go tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.400
others what they saw once they saw jesus and it&nbsp;
caused the shepherds to go and praise god for what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.560
they had seen see we learned last week in this&nbsp;
season of praise that we not only need to remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.680
what christ has done for everyone but we need to&nbsp;
tell others what christ has done for them as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.720
so how do we conclude the series this week we're&nbsp;
going to be talking about simeon and we're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.280
to be talking about his praise and what god had&nbsp;
revealed to him that he would see christ before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.080
his death and that really we would get to have a&nbsp;
response the same way that simeon did is how are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.760
we going to respond now that christ is here how&nbsp;
are we going to respond now that christ is here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.560
and so let's jump into this text again luke&nbsp;
chapter 2 verses 25-35 i've asked joe to read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:09.840
this week and joe if you don't mind just standing&nbsp;
up and reading from the book of luke for us

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:23.840
by the spirit

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:37.840
praise god

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:05.840
destiny

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.680
thanks joe let's take some time to pray lord&nbsp;
jesus we thank you so much for today lord and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.800
what we've already got to experience through uh&nbsp;
the children's christmas program lord to remind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.200
us of the story your story lord and so i just pray&nbsp;
as we lord open up your word and we talk about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.880
lord may each one of us leave here today change&nbsp;
because of it um and respond lord accordingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.240
uh lord how you would have us respond and&nbsp;
so we just pray this in your heavenly name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.200
amen so just so you guys know and i'm always&nbsp;
gonna encourage you in this i meant to say this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.000
before number one if you don't have a copy of&nbsp;
god's word uh there's two ways you can have it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.400
because i always say always encourage people take&nbsp;
it with you wherever you go one of those is back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.240
there on our next steps table we have a bible&nbsp;
for you um it's free gift to you if you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.440
to take it home study it read through it it's&nbsp;
yours the other is which is the my favorite way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.600
because if i bring my bible with me wherever i&nbsp;
go i tend to leave it wherever i go anybody else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.200
okay we inherit bibles around here because people&nbsp;
leave them uh so it's called the bible app i love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.080
the holy bible app which is the you version bible&nbsp;
app you can download that on any platform i don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.440
even know what the platforms are but you know&nbsp;
what they are whatever your phone is i would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.520
encourage you to download it and bring it with&nbsp;
you wherever you go because it is is so important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.880
um but so so you know i want you to to know me&nbsp;
some of you don't even know who i am maybe you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.960
haven't ever met me um but i am a practical person&nbsp;
which means this i could sit up here all day and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.240
try to preach high end words that make no sense&nbsp;
to you but make sense to me because that makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.920
something somebody look good i'm not worried&nbsp;
about that as much as i'm saying hey i want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.080
teach you how i study the word which means&nbsp;
this i'm going to walk through this text&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.960
basically just pulling apart what we see in the&nbsp;
text and try to make it as simple as possible for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.880
each one of us i don't know if you guys like that&nbsp;
or not i know i do because that's the only way i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.240
can understand the word and so we're going to walk&nbsp;
through it that way in this text and the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.520
thing we see here is who the heck is simeon it's&nbsp;
a cool name anybody ever named their child simeon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.120
okay good i can make fun of the name then i'm&nbsp;
joking so anyway simeon is an interesting name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.400
but simeon as we know in this text is it says&nbsp;
that he is a righteous and devout man and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.320
i said okay what does this mean what is him&nbsp;
righteous and devout man it means he's in right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.920
standing with god and he's deeply committed&nbsp;
to god's work and so we wonder why did god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.360
allow simeon this opportunity because it says that&nbsp;
he was given the opportunity to see jesus before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.520
his death why did he give him the opportunity&nbsp;
and i believe he gave him the opportunity because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.240
he was a devout and righteous man because he was&nbsp;
seeking the lord and if you want to know and again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.560
i'm going to have to stop myself consistently&nbsp;
from going off on tangents but if you want to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:44.880
and experience who god is be devout and follow god&nbsp;
as you follow him he will reveal himself more and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.360
more to you and so that's what samia got to do&nbsp;
he got to experience this right so what was he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.840
looking forward to and so we look here it says&nbsp;
he was looking forward to israel's consolation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:02.720
i struggle with verbs and nouns and pronouns&nbsp;
and any of that stuff so i was like what does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.600
consolation mean what does consolation mean so i&nbsp;
went and studied it i was like what is consolation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.920
so what is it basically is this is where god has&nbsp;
promised to console his people because they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.840
been afflicted god has promised to console his&nbsp;
people because they've been afflicted well as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.960
we begin to think through well what what have they&nbsp;
been afflicted for or from well it's that each one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.240
of them uh have sins in their life that they have&nbsp;
really separated themselves from god because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.240
how they've lived and so god has come to console&nbsp;
them and so i want to kind of fill you in because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.880
if we jump off into the store and we say okay&nbsp;
christ has come what happened before christ came&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.280
and again if you're anything like me you get&nbsp;
stuck in the middle of a story in about five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.360
minutes happy you're going to check out and the&nbsp;
other five of you might fall asleep don't worry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.880
we'll keep the lights dim enough where you won't&nbsp;
get caught um but so where did we start so in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.320
beginning this is where i'd love to start in the&nbsp;
beginning god created everything god created you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.880
and me right and and we were his greatest&nbsp;
creation and see god walked with us in peace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:12.960
in a perfect place right where there was no&nbsp;
sin at all and that was where god wanted to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.160
with people but something happened right the fall&nbsp;
this is where adam and eve sinned against god they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.360
chose to listen to satan right to eat of the fruit&nbsp;
that they shouldn't have eaten of and you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.320
say well man that's such a hard harsh reality&nbsp;
to to punish them to separate them from god but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:34.880
here's what god is god is perfect and so god had&nbsp;
to separate man from him and so we had this time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:41.760
period right after the fall of where man had law&nbsp;
right the god had given them the law to follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.520
after and they couldn't ever attain perfection&nbsp;
right it was only for a time that their sins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:51.120
would be covered and so god had a perfect plan he&nbsp;
says hey you can't meet the expectation you're the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.200
one that sinned but you can't meet the expectation&nbsp;
to be present with me in that relationship again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.360
but i can so this is where we are in the story&nbsp;
god said i have a way to restore our relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.360
so we're looking at restoration right so we have&nbsp;
the creation right the beginning and then we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.240
the fall and then now we have restoration which&nbsp;
is god restoring our relationship back to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.560
the only way he could do that is by sending&nbsp;
his son who could live a perfect life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:24.240
who could be sinless and who could step into our&nbsp;
place see our sin separates us from god and if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.320
continue to live in that sin and we don't allow&nbsp;
god's son to replace us in that punishment that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.880
we deserve we will die for our sins but jesus&nbsp;
stepped in to die for our sins so we see here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.520
why would he be looking forward to the&nbsp;
consolation of his people he knew his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.800
people desire to be saved from their sins&nbsp;
and he was getting ready to experience jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.720
the one who would do that see i don't&nbsp;
know about you guys but that is a big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:55.440
deal that is a big deal when we think about what&nbsp;
god did and why simeon would be so excited to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.560
to see jesus right and so that's where we find&nbsp;
ourselves in this story right simeon was waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.120
for god to rescue his people and it had been&nbsp;
revealed to him that he would see god before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.320
before see jesus before the end of his life and&nbsp;
so this is the season where i think of christmas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.560
right god has showed us in the christmas&nbsp;
season that he has fulfilled this promise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.960
to send his son jesus to give us the gift&nbsp;
of salvation so we have a reason to praise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
so let me read this let me read the next couple&nbsp;
of texts that we can kind of see so we see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.120
obviously god's promise and then we see his&nbsp;
promise fulfilled so verses 27 on says god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:36.400
guided us to me um guided by the spirit he entered&nbsp;
the temple and when the the parents brought in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.960
child jesus to the perform him for him what was&nbsp;
customary under the law simeon took him up in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.720
his arms and praised god and said now master&nbsp;
you can dismiss your servant in peace as you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.560
promised for my eyes have seen your salvation you&nbsp;
have prepared it in the presence of all people a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:00.800
light for revelation to the gentiles and glory&nbsp;
to your people israel so we see god promised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:07.920
again to fulfill this promise through jesus what&nbsp;
was simeon's response it was to praise god it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.040
to praise god so i want to ask this question&nbsp;
usually i ask a lot more questions today i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.880
probably going to be a little bit less but i asked&nbsp;
this question how many of y'all have ever prayed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.640
for something it came true god answered it and you&nbsp;
forgot to praise him and thank him for it anybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.080
i'm glad i'm the only one of the few thank you the&nbsp;
rest y'all are lying lying okay you know you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.360
thrown up one of those hail mary prayers please&nbsp;
god please god god answers it and we forget to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:41.920
thank god right i look at christmas this way and&nbsp;
we we go into the christmas season charging after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.080
the season of fun and excitement and gifts and&nbsp;
parties and everything else the decorations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:56.640
but do do you sometimes forget to praise god for&nbsp;
this season that he actually sent god through his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:03.280
son jesus to reconcile us back to him like that's&nbsp;
a big deal y'all because apart from god doing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.200
one day each one of us will stand before god and&nbsp;
we will be judged according to the way we've lived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.040
and we have one of two choices to&nbsp;
be judged by god on our own account&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:21.760
or for jesus to step in and say no that&nbsp;
debt is paid see jesus coming is a big deal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:29.920
and when god does something so big like simeon&nbsp;
saul he saw jesus in his hands he praised god and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:36.000
we should praise god during the season as well so&nbsp;
as he's guided by the spirit right to go and see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:47.280
jesus and the parents obviously brought them in&nbsp;
um what happened right what happened well we see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:53.680
here with with simeon is that the bigger the gift&nbsp;
the bigger the praise right um there's been times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:59.040
where i've gotten a shirt for christmas and i'm&nbsp;
like yay thank you so much and it probably doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:07.200
even fit um but then there's times where somebody&nbsp;
has blessed my socks off there was one year we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:13.520
actually had received about 500 in the mail and i&nbsp;
was like oh my gosh like that's a big deal and i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.880
wanted to know who it was they didn't they didn't&nbsp;
address it and i didn't get to say thank you but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.160
i got to say thank you to god so i look at those&nbsp;
two things to say the bigger the thing the bigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.240
the praise right the bigger the gift the bigger&nbsp;
the praise and so what was simeon's response when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.360
we look at this and i want us to look at verse 30&nbsp;
it says he says for my eyes have seen salvation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:38.560
so first we see what god was actually doing&nbsp;
through sending jesus was simeon recognized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.520
that he had experienced salvation himself that he&nbsp;
had physically got to see salvation in his hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.120
but simeon wasn't done he began to look at verse&nbsp;
31 and 32 where he says you have prepared it not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.640
only for me but you prepared it in the presence&nbsp;
of all people a light for a revelation to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:59.760
gentiles and the glory to your people from israel&nbsp;
and so you kind of know this if you're a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:05.760
bit new to the word um gentiles are basically&nbsp;
anybody else that is not jews which was god's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.600
original people when you when you go back to&nbsp;
the old testament and through abraham and again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.440
there's a long story there you can talk to me&nbsp;
about it after we can look at it together but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.440
there's two different people right and so he says&nbsp;
this is for all people the gentiles and the jews&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:24.560
it's everyone together this is for everyone and so&nbsp;
i started thinking about this in verse 29 he says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:32.960
now master can you dismiss your servant in peace&nbsp;
as you had promised why could simeon go in peace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:38.000
why could simeon go in peace i started thinking&nbsp;
about this and i kept asking myself this question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.920
you know sometimes some of us when we think about&nbsp;
death is this a scary thing and so you know i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.680
don't want to die either it is scary but simeon&nbsp;
had a peace as saying hey lord you can take me now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.680
because i've seen jesus and i heard this&nbsp;
this quote from warren weirsby he said this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:59.280
god's people are not afraid of death because it&nbsp;
only frees them from the burdens of this life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.800
and leads them into the blessings of the next&nbsp;
life see i don't know about you guys i have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.720
burdens on my life i enjoy this life i enjoy&nbsp;
my family there's a lot of great and amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.200
things but there are certain things in my life&nbsp;
that i pray i don't have to experience one day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.800
in eternity and that's death and suffering&nbsp;
and sorrow and can i can i get a witness pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:25.280
i mean i'm still young but i'm still aching when i&nbsp;
get out of bed so i mean i want to get rid of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.680
so all these things will be removed&nbsp;
so he could celebrate and praise god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.160
because he knew that when he died he&nbsp;
had seen and experienced salvation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:40.880
so simeon's response was again to accept god's&nbsp;
promise that he had given him right to to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.880
him from his sins and from everyone's sins&nbsp;
what should our response be that's what i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.360
saw in this text what should our response be we&nbsp;
see simeon's was god had promised him something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:54.400
he had experienced it and praised god and again&nbsp;
the bigger the gift the bigger the praise but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:00.480
then there's a response what is our response what&nbsp;
was what was adam uh what was joseph's and mary's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.720
response and so let's look at this in verse 33&nbsp;
it says his father and mother speaking of jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.640
father and mother were amazed at what was being&nbsp;
said about him and i asked myself this question

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:21.840
are we as amazed as joseph and mary were at what&nbsp;
simeon was saying and what they were experiencing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:27.680
see i think we should be amazed at what&nbsp;
god has done through jesus but then we see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.560
what he describes the response of many right&nbsp;
simeon describes a response that many will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:38.000
this is in verses 34 and 35. he says then simeon&nbsp;
blessed them and told his mother mary indeed this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
child is destined to cause the fall and the rise&nbsp;
of many in israel and to be assigned to those who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.840
will be opposed and a sword will be pierce your&nbsp;
own soul and that the thoughts of many hearts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:56.560
may be revealed so we know this that the response&nbsp;
of many will be the rise and the fall of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:04.320
some will reject and some will accept and i think&nbsp;
about this every person on this earth has a choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.880
this is what i love about god i love about&nbsp;
god that he actually gives me the choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.840
and if if any of y'all are married&nbsp;
does anybody like being told what to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.680
not me good i didn't see anybody do that nobody&nbsp;
likes being told what to do and this is what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:25.280
i love about god he's not telling you you have&nbsp;
to accept him it's your choice it's your choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:32.880
but here's the thing it's also&nbsp;
your choice of what you'll receive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:40.800
and so in this this time simeon knew there was&nbsp;
going to be some that would rise and accept christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:47.520
just like him and there would be some that would&nbsp;
fall that would refuse and reject who are those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.480
that accept we've been talking about this a&nbsp;
lot over the last couple months it's those who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.360
recognize their need who recognize they can't live&nbsp;
this life apart from christ that they cannot live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.640
and die in a way that would honor god that would&nbsp;
actually even allow them to spend eternity with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:08.240
god and so because they understand their need for&nbsp;
god they're the ones that will receive this those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:13.840
who are prideful who are do it yourself i can&nbsp;
figure this out i can be as good as possible as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.320
long as i'm at least 51 good i'll be good enough&nbsp;
and god's going to say that's never good enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.800
see all of us want to try that and i've tried it&nbsp;
and i want to share this a little bit with you my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.880
salvation story i want to be brief with this but&nbsp;
my salvation story is this i spent the majority of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.440
my life one actually i had i kind of grew up&nbsp;
in a little bit of a church setting and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:39.280
some major things happened that caused me to hate&nbsp;
god for a long time for a long time and whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.440
i got invited to go to church i went to church&nbsp;
because i had had my first daughter and i was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.480
like i got to figure this thing out and i spent&nbsp;
the whole year trying to get right which means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:53.600
this i tried eliminating everything and every&nbsp;
time i eliminated it i picked it back up because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.800
it just wasn't working and it finally came to&nbsp;
this point where i'm never going to be good enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:07.120
and then i heard one day god said you're right&nbsp;
but i am and it was that moment a year later after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.200
spending time in church that i finally said lord&nbsp;
i'm never going to be good enough but you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.480
so what happened i gave my life to christ and&nbsp;
it wasn't like poof like everything was great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:24.400
but one step one more day one more day to get to&nbsp;
know the lord and hit receive his mercy grace and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:30.240
everything else allowed me to experience what i&nbsp;
experienced today which i'm a pastor today doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.680
mean everybody's gonna be a pastor right but&nbsp;
what i would say is this god has changed my life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:41.680
completely because i came broken not&nbsp;
prideful so simeon recognizes this right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.680
so each one of us i mentioned this earlier&nbsp;
each one of us will stand before god right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.240
and our sins will be listed out and one of&nbsp;
two things are going to happen is that judge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:54.080
is together going to say hey i'm going&nbsp;
to judge you according to your own sins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:00.320
and you'll spend eternity separated from me in a&nbsp;
place called hell or jesus will step in and say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:05.040
i took his or her spot on the cross and died&nbsp;
in their place and their sin is paid in full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:12.240
i don't want you to miss this either i spent a lot&nbsp;
of time as i was in church and when i was out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.480
churches it seemed like only thing that people&nbsp;
would talk to me about is heaven and hell and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:22.160
let me let me be clear we need to to make sure we&nbsp;
understand where we're going when we meet eternity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.480
but i think the blessing that too many people&nbsp;
miss talking about is this blessing that god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:34.240
gives you now see when you accept christ&nbsp;
when you choose to say hey lord i need you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.560
you get to experience salvation&nbsp;
and god now until you meet eternity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:46.160
and those of you in the room i mean i i don't&nbsp;
know you're probably similar to me if you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:52.320
lived any part of your life with christ it is way&nbsp;
better than your life was apart from christ amen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:53.200 --> 00:23:01.600
i've said this so many times my best day as a as&nbsp;
a person who didn't follow christ is still worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.840
than my worst day as a follower of christ and i'm&nbsp;
going to say this again so it's a little bit clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:12.320
my best day as an unbeliever is still worse&nbsp;
than my worst day as a believer why because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:18.560
the presence of god has been with me in the midst&nbsp;
of that worst day as a believer and his presence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:25.360
is way more important his peace his comfort his&nbsp;
forgiveness his grace his mercy everything that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.920
i needed in those worst moments were way better&nbsp;
than the best moments i had as an unbeliever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.760
every one of us will spend eternity somewhere but&nbsp;
also every one of us will spend the rest of our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:41.600
lives with or without god and i'll tell you this&nbsp;
i want to be as honest as i can i'm not selling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:47.760
anything i'm being real it has changed my life&nbsp;
and that's why i stand here every week because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:53.760
i wanted to change yours i wanted to change yours&nbsp;
it's so important that we do not miss that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.280
side of heaven so as we conclude this series&nbsp;
there's just a couple things i want to mention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.040
i hope that if you haven't heard&nbsp;
anything from me today that number one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:11.200
that you remember this season is a season to give&nbsp;
god praise that our awe of the season does not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:16.480
take place of our all of christ and i'll say that&nbsp;
again i pray that this series has challenged you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.080
to remember christ that the all of the season&nbsp;
has not taken presence over the all of christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:28.080
because he is worthy to be praised during&nbsp;
the season what jesus has done is amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:36.000
right but the question is how are we going&nbsp;
to respond i started thinking through this um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.880
you know something can be amazing from a&nbsp;
distance and i started thinking this about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.560
this story you know you may be sitting in this&nbsp;
message maybe this is the first time you've heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:49.520
the message of christ maybe it's the hundredth&nbsp;
time but the message seems good from a distance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.000
but the true blessing is when you experience it&nbsp;
and so you all know i'm kind of a foodie and i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.840
love love some chocolate ice cream with some nuts&nbsp;
on it and i started thinking through this you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.680
i've kind of been trying to eat healthier lately&nbsp;
and i've been to a couple places where there was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.520
ice cream my kids actually got ice cream this week&nbsp;
and they they like loaded up the ice cream with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:16.880
all these things and it looks so good but i missed&nbsp;
out on the blessing because i didn't eat any of it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
i know you're wondering where am i going with this&nbsp;
guys today to receive the full blessing that god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.360
has for you the life change the peace the mercy&nbsp;
the grace everything that i've been talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.720
you can't receive that from a distance you've got&nbsp;
to experience it personally you've got to taste&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.240
and see that the lord is good and he is from&nbsp;
personal experience from personal experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:48.240
he is amazing so the best part of christmas is to&nbsp;
receive what jesus came to give us grace hope and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.600
mercy forgiveness of our sins and a relationship&nbsp;
with him let me tell you what it cost you nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.600
now some of us will say no you've got to sacrifice&nbsp;
and trust me i'm not talking about that it costs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:05.360
you nothing because christ did everything christ&nbsp;
did everything on the cross to meet you where you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:11.520
are it cost you nothing it cost him everything&nbsp;
how do you receive it by confessing your need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.240
for god and asking god to forgive you for your&nbsp;
sins and to turn your life over him to take a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.760
step forward you don't have to know everything you&nbsp;
just have to know the most important thing jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:27.280
and your need for him so this time as we have a&nbsp;
time of invitation we always have this time of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.840
invitation at the end of service i think too many&nbsp;
times at churches we don't explain it very well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:38.080
and i want to explain it as clear as possible&nbsp;
we have invitation for us to take time to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:43.600
god what have you taught me today so you may be&nbsp;
saying hey ben your message spoke nothing to me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:49.520
but what the kids did spoke to me reflect on&nbsp;
that maybe it was the music maybe god spoke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:55.360
to you through the music reflect on that maybe&nbsp;
god did speak to you through the message reflect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:02.160
on that this is a time to say god what are you&nbsp;
speaking to me about because i promise you this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:09.120
every one of you are here for a defined reason now&nbsp;
you may say i came to see a grandchild or a child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:16.800
singing this you're right you did but god met&nbsp;
you here to say you are here for a purpose to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.960
speak to you so what is the response that you&nbsp;
have to respond to and here's just a couple of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.200
scenarios that it could be that god's leading&nbsp;
you to for some of us it could be to make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:30.240
that during this season you make christ the center&nbsp;
of it you may say hey but we're we're 19 days in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.960
i've missed it nope you still got plenty of&nbsp;
time and really after christmas is over you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.840
still systemati should make christ center so maybe&nbsp;
this is during this time you consider and say lord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.800
no i'm a believer i've followed you&nbsp;
but i've been distracted and maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.200
this is the time you surrender that&nbsp;
for some of us it's to praise god more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.360
we forget how many blessings we have if you want&nbsp;
to know what god's done for you start writing down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.480
everything you got to do today you woke up&nbsp;
you have a house now you may say you did that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.400
god gave you the breath and the ability to&nbsp;
do it so you better say thank you for it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.160
right so maybe today it's to reflect and say&nbsp;
lord i need to give you praise for these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:14.160
but for some of us for some of us it's a time&nbsp;
to accept what christ did on the cross why we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:21.440
are here for this season of christmas christ&nbsp;
came to give you life eternally and life now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:27.280
more abundantly than you have ever experienced&nbsp;
in your life i love if you know me as a pastor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:32.080
i'm bad at quoting scripture to a t but i'm good&nbsp;
at quoting scripture because god's just put it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:39.440
on my heart right so god has given us exceedingly&nbsp;
abundantly more exceedingly abundantly more than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:45.120
we could ask or think according to him who works&nbsp;
in us god desires to do that through your life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:52.320
as a church if you don't know us at all inspiring&nbsp;
hope exists to inspire hope in your life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.440
by helping you discover god's purpose for&nbsp;
your life through a relationship with jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:03.200
what does that mean we believe this every person&nbsp;
in this room has a purpose divine from god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.280
for you to fulfill and it comes&nbsp;
through a relationship with jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.080
so here's my challenge to you as we take time&nbsp;
to reflect and this is what's going to happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.600
brock's going to play lightly we're going&nbsp;
to be able to bow our heads and just pray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.560
and meet with the lord but as we reflect&nbsp;
on what god is teaching us through today's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:28.080
message i challenge you to respond don't leave&nbsp;
here before you commit to something to praise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:34.240
to make christ center or to give your life to&nbsp;
jesus and this is what i do every week i stand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.800
in the back during this time of reflection i stand&nbsp;
in the time in the back because i don't want you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:44.000
to sit here going i have questions and i don't&nbsp;
know where to go that's where you can go come talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.920
to me i want to talk with you about what questions&nbsp;
you have from this message what it means to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:54.240
give your life to christ come see me but i'll&nbsp;
challenge you to this you have one life to live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.960
one life to live and you only get to live at once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:09.040
i challenge you to live it with christ at the&nbsp;
center so let's pray lord jesus we love you lord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:18.320
god you're good your word reminds us lord through&nbsp;
simeon that you promised to send your son jesus

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.240
and lord this is a season to remember that&nbsp;
you did it you fulfilled your promise lord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:29.760
we give you praise for that we thank you for&nbsp;
that because apart from christ coming to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.200
earth and dying in our place&nbsp;
we would be lost and hopeless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:40.000
but you have given us hope during this&nbsp;
season you've given us the ability to receive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.040
grace and mercy and forgiveness of our sins and&nbsp;
a new relationship with you lord that is restored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:52.240
or that's the part of the gospel that i think we&nbsp;
so much miss as we are restored in you back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:52.240 --> 00:31:00.640
original relationship that you designed peace with&nbsp;
you wow lord i pray that there if there is people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.240
in this room lord that don't know you i pray&nbsp;
that they come to faith in you and lord that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.640
they give their lives to you lord i pray&nbsp;
that they during this time of reflection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:13.200
lord that they will just step out lord and come&nbsp;
to the back and say hey ben i've got questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.000
lord if it's even not that lord i pray that at&nbsp;
the next table after service they come up and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.520
say ben i've got questions lord that today they&nbsp;
don't leave before they give their life to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.720
lord i pray that you move in mighty ways and&nbsp;
every one of our life's lord that we leave out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:35.120
of here changed because god you have a plan for&nbsp;
us to fulfill this side of heaven and i pray that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:45.840
