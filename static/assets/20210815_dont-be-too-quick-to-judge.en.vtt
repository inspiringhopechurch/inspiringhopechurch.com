00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
pumped um about what we're gonna discuss today 
and to say that um as we jump into this you'll  

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.760
probably say why are you saying that but um this 
is something i've kind of found as i study god's  

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.320
word is there's those times where you've read a 
passage multiple times and then you read it again  

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.880
you're like wow like i saw something new and so i 
really feel like that this text today that we'll  

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.440
walk through um each one of us if you've walked 
through the book of jonah that's where we're going  

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.080
to be today the book of jonah um we're going to 
walk through that over the next several weeks  

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.160
probably months because we typically 
go pretty slow on on these verses  

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.320
um but i believe you're going to see something 
new maybe that you haven't seen and that's what  

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.840
i just asked the lord to do in your life and in my 
life and so i encourage you to do the same thing  

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.960
but i'm thankful for the word of god and just 
an encouragement to you if you don't have a copy  

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.680
meaning if you don't bring your bible with you 
which whenever i used to go to church i didn't  

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.200
bring my bible either i just brought it on my 
phone my phone's the greatest resource because  

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.440
i would forget my bible at church and so i don't 
bring my bible except for now whenever i preach  

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.640
so if you don't have a bible grab one on 
the way out on our next steps table if you  

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.480
also don't have one and don't want to grab one 
just grab your phone download the you version  

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.600
bible app look for jonah jonah's going to be near 
the old testament it's probably actually nearer  

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.320
to matthew in the new testament but it's still 
the old testament um and uh hopefully you'll  

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.280
find that as you're looking but we'll be in jonah 
chapter one verses one through three in that and  

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.520
so something i just wanted to encourage you with 
is this idea of if sunday morning is the only time  

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.520
that you open the word of god and you 
hear from the word of god it's not enough  

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.560
and i was just thinking through that this 
morning is there was times whenever i first  

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.200
started attending church where that was the only 
place that i got the word of god in my life was  

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.480
whenever a pastor would preach it and i would read 
it and then i would close it and then i would open  

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.000
it up next sunday but as i've found in my life 
as i've personally grown that that's not enough  

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.040
so i think of it this way if you ate 
one meal a week would you survive

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.120
maybe you would look really sickly you might 
be able to survive but you might look sickly  

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.920
so if that's what our physical bodies would 
look like what do our spiritual bodies look  

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.640
like when we feed ourselves once a week very 
sick right dried up whatever you want to call  

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.520
it just that imagery so just an encouragement 
to you is um don't miss the opportunity to be  

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.440
in the word of god every day don't miss the 
opportunity to just pray however you can  

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.080
if you don't know all the words that you think you 
need to know just pray what's on your heart it's a  

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.040
conversation with god but i do want to encourage 
you as we walk through the book of jonah if you  

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.960
aren't currently reading something during the 
week or even if you are read along with us which  

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.040
means this each week i encourage you just read 
through the book of jonah it'll be easy if you  

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.360
read through the book of jonah each week during 
this series i think that god will speak to you  

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.320
and you'll be even more ready to receive 
whatever god has for you when you come on sundays  

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.920
so just an encouragement for you but as we jump 
into this book i know it's familiar to some of  

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.840
you so i want to talk to everybody and just kind 
of see what do you remember about the jonas story  

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.280
and you may even just have the kids version of it 
so what do you guys remember of the jonah story  

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.880
what's the highlights about 
a well is it a well anybody  

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.960
it could be a fish i don't know it's always that 
big thing it's not a world's a fish but it's  

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.880
really it's big fish it's a mammal there okay 
what else do we remember well definitely one

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.920
anybody remember anything else about jonah 
he ran from god so he's running and how many  

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.160
of us like running in here i mean like 
physically running i mean some of us do  

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:14.240
okay what else do you remember what's some 
of the things you remember jonah's story

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.680
nineveh right the people that he did 
not want to go to i'll give one more  

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:27.840
one more shout out what's one more thing 
maybe you remember about the jonah story

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.400
okay so we'll just it's okay so i just wanted 
to kind of get you guys jumping in on that  

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.720
um and so a couple of things that we just kind of 
remember what i thought of was the first thing is  

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.320
jonah was a prophet right if you think of the song 
anybody here jonah was a prophet i'm gonna stop if  

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.280
you guys don't know what i'm okay um but anyways 
there is a children's song about that so john was  

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.120
a prophet a prophet uh was known to speak whatever 
god told them so they had a great connection with  

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.520
god this is pre christ coming dying raising again 
and the holy spirit coming in our life so now that  

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.000
we have full access to god we don't need a prophet 
to speak to us or even a priest to speak to us  

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.640
for god god can speak directly to us but a prophet 
would receive a word from the lord and usually it  

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.000
was either good or bad right so and what we say 
with this is hey destruction is going to come down  

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.880
on you you need to repent and turn or and that was 
this case right or the other is hey something good  

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:32.160
is going to happen and so obviously jonah in in 
his previous before this time he actually gave  

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.840
a good report about the israel which was god's 
people of that time would receive back some land  

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.840
and so it was positive jonah was known as really 
a good prophet right so a prophet that didn't  

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.440
if he prophesied and something didn't come true 
he was known as a false prophet and most false  

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.720
prophets would be killed so in those days it'd 
be fun to be a prophet i'm just joking by the way  

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.720
um but here's some key themes that you know 
obviously we think of but the great fish  

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.840
right or the well is mentioned four times the 
great city of nineveh is mentioned nine times  

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.720
and the disobedient prophet 
jonah has mentioned 18 times  

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.440
but when we really look at this book mentioned 
it 38 times as god this book is really about god  

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.960
in all these four chapters and so there's two 
things that we're gonna see throughout this  

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.240
book as we walk through it uh as one is is 
that the book of jonah is about the will of god  

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.880
and how we should respond to it um and 
then it's also about the love of god and  

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.720
how we should share it with others so 
we'll we'll be using those two themes  

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.000
right the will of god and how we should 
respond to it and the love of god and  

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.040
how we should share with others and we're 
going to learn how jonah had a poor example  

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.200
but one of the things we're also going to learn 
is it's easy to judge other people um in their  

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.880
disobedience to the lord and then sit over in our 
side and you know not really look at ourselves  

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.800
and so it's going to be easy to judge them but 
here's what i saw as i began to study this is  

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.200
as we look more and more into the story rather 
than seeing jonah in this story you're gonna see  

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.120
yourself a reflection of yourself which brings 
about you know a little bit of conviction and  

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.200
awkwardness of like oh gosh if if this is how i'm 
acting then what should i do and we'll talk about  

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:24.720
that so um let's jump into this so that we um can 
kind of see where god's gonna lead us and so we're  

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.600
just gonna cover the first three verses in jonah 
chapter one and this is what it says it says the  

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:36.880
word of the lord came to jonah son of amitai 
get up and go to the great city of nineveh and  

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:43.840
preach against it because their evil has come up 
before me and so jonah got up to fleet of tarshish  

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.320
from the lord's presence he went down to joppa and 
found a ship going to tarshish he paid the fare  

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:58.640
and went down into it to go with them to tarshish 
from the lord's presence so we hear a command  

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.760
and he runs directly from it i don't know 
if any of you have ever ran from you know  

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.840
an opportunity or maybe it's a command from god 
but we're going to kind of look at this and see  

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.240
how every situation that jonah walked through 
and really the problems that jonah had was  

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.560
all about a wrong attitude anybody ever 
had a wrong attitude towards something  

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.200
i know i have okay so we've 
got a couple of hands back here  

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:36.480
i think about this way you ever do something for 
somebody but you do it but begrudgingly right like  

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.640
i gotta you know for me it's cleaning bathrooms 
i don't like clean bathrooms i'll fold laundry  

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.840
all day i'll do dishes but if it's bathrooms it's 
like i'm mumbling under my breath right for some  

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:54.400
of us it's what we're doing at our job right our 
attitude is poor because we don't like what we  

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.120
have to do or what the boss wants us to do or the 
deadline he's given us and again most of us can  

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.720
think through multiple different other things 
that we have a poor attitude and so jonah had  

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.880
the wrong attitude towards several things we're 
looking for them today and the first one is it's  

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.080
towards the will of god when we think about jonah 
he had the wrong attitude towards the will of god  

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:21.120
see jonah's looking at this situation and god is 
calling him to go preach which is not uncommon  

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:28.240
for jonah against nineveh well if you look at 
who nineveh is and really it's the assyrians  

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.360
who lived in nineveh they were israels again 
god's people these are the people that jonah  

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:40.480
was a part of that was their worst enemy see the 
assyrians were known as people who tortured people  

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.640
uh their enemies and they would do horrible 
horrible things to them right and so imagine  

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.880
being asked to go do something like that 
where you would have to go to your enemy and  

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.200
preach against them right i don't know about you 
guys but i'd be pretty afraid because i wouldn't  

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:05.200
be tortured number one i wouldn't probably want 
anybody to forgive people that have wronged me  

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.720
right i think those are a couple of things that 
we think about but i think about this just to  

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:15.120
kind of give you some context uh 9 11 was one 
of the most tragic things ever to happen to our  

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.560
country and at that moment everybody knows that we 
probably flipped the switch and we had a negative  

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.160
view towards the enemy whoever that was i don't 
remember if it was the taliban or iraq or whoever  

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.560
everybody had a different perspective but in that 
moment that that happened imagine somebody walking  

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:35.120
up to you and say hey actually let's just let me 
just go a little bit further what if god spoke  

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.880
directly to you and said hey go there and preach 
so that they may repent and turn from their sins  

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.760
that would have been difficult i don't know about 
you guys but there would have been a lot of anger  

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.200
welling up in me going no just pour out your 
wrath lord they deserve it see this is the exact  

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.840
and i may be wrong but i i kind of 
look this exact comparison we can think  

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.840
in present day that we can maybe think that 
jonah was going through why jonah would run  

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.360
because that's the first thing i think of i want 
to judge jonah the lord spoke to you and you ran  

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:13.840
like really jonah i mean come on but it was 
a tough tough thing that god asked me to do  

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.520
and so you know again jonah had the wrong attitude 
towards god's will it looks like it's justified  

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.000
when we think about this um but it's easy to 
follow god and this is the part where i want  

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.200
to kind of get it it's easy to follow god when 
we're comfortable when it's what we want to do  

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.800
you know when god says hey go to church which 
really he doesn't say go to church he says gather  

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:41.520
with god's people we say hey that's easy i love 
the people of god let's go right he says hey spend  

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.480
time in the word with me you go you know it's 
actually fun reading i love reading the word great  

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.560
easy hey go across the street talk to your 
neighbor about jesus oh wait whoa too much

00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.080
they may think i'm weird i may not know every 
answer that they are going to ask me lord no  

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.720
i'm good nobody's ever done that probably here 
i i know i have several times right that that  

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.840
thought of saying no right it's easy to follow 
god when it's comfortable jonah just got done  

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.280
prophesying that israel is going to reclaim 
some of their land that was easy celebrate  

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.160
jonah he brought a great word from the lord now 
he's asked to go to his enemies right and so  

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.080
i know i was confronted with that the moment 
that i got saved i had somebody in my life  

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:32.800
without going to a long story but i had somebody 
in my life that i hated had actually really broke  

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:38.400
apart a lot of our family and a lot of things that 
happened young in my life and i hated that person  

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.800
i mean literally hated them when i would talk to 
people about that person i would talk about how  

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.200
much i hated them the moment that i came to faith 
in christ was the moment that god reminded me  

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.840
at that moment i had to make a decision was i 
going to forgive this guy and move on or was  

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.240
it going to hold a grudge and i had to forgive 
him and was it easy no it was a daily decision  

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.600
until now today i can actually care for this 
person one of my friends this was his dad but  

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.760
i still had a grudge against him and this guy's 
actually struggling in the hospital right now  

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.800
and i reached out to my friend and i said hey how 
can i pray for him so today a guy in which i hated  

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.400
but after i gave my life to the lord i have 
forgiven and can now look at with compassion  

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:23.520
and see it's it's one of those things that i 
think at times we we think we have this oh we're  

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.840
justified by how we feel and jonah felt the same 
way right so it's easy to follow jesus when it's  

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.320
when it's comfortable but not when we 
get placed in this uncomfortable position  

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.440
and so um let me ask this question then for you  

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.880
how many of y'all do well outside of your 
comfort zones anybody just raise your hand  

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.120
whenever you're placed in a spot that you're 
not comfortable how many of you excel at that  

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.920
okay so if i asked somebody to stand up 
here right now and begin to take my place to  

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.040
to preach this text how many by raise of 
hands would want to jump up here and do that  

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:06.320
okay matt's coming i'm trying so i saw him you 
know no anyways so i look at these moments right  

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:11.760
it's those moments where you're like oh gosh like 
i'm not prepared i'm uncomfortable you name it  

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:19.360
so we all understand that we now want to sit here 
and look at jonah and say jonah how could you run  

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:26.880
but many of us run every day to the places 
of comfort rather than the places that god  

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.680
has called us so this is the moment where we're 
going to set the stage for this book and we're  

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:36.880
going to go we're going to spend the rest of this 
book looking in a mirror rather than at jonah and  

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:42.080
at ourselves and our walk with god now let me be 
the greatest encourager that i can be because i  

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:48.800
want to be this is not meant to defeat you it's 
meant to encourage you it's meant to remind you  

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.840
it's meant to help you because the cool part 
would if you go back to jonah's circumstance  

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:59.680
god was with jonah god gave jonah the words 
god gave jonah the power and the protection  

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.920
but jonah didn't see that he thought of something 
else and so i just to give you an example if you  

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.960
want to know hey do i struggle with this i 
probably already said yes but friday night  

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:19.600
we went to a um it was a cookout um payton is part 
of a uh homeschool group and they had what i don't  

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:26.960
ever know some kind of dinner thing for these 
what a and b something group okay i'm you y'all  

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.680
seventh and eighth year there we go it's close 
enough whatever there was there's other programs  

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:38.000
so you can tell how much involved i am so first 
of all this means this i'm i'm going to a dinner  

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.480
with people i don't know and the whole way there 
britney's like you're acting weird and i'm like  

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.440
i'm just nervous and she's like why it's like 
because i don't know anybody and she's like you're  

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.720
nervous because this isn't about like you're not 
in control of the situation i'm like you're right  

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.680
so we get out and like i'm saying some you know 
like crazy words because i'm trying to just like  

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.200
get comfortable and finally like i just shrink 
in a corner and we leave at 7 30. like i mean i  

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.840
i talked to a few people but i walked away and 
just was like man i really failed today like  

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.680
there's a ton of people i could have met and i met 
a few but really i could have done better and like  

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:19.520
i come back to this and i'm like i did the same 
thing i'm comfortable around y'all i'm comfortable  

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:25.520
in the places in which you know i'm familiar with 
my home my kids the things i like the things i  

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:30.240
know about but the moment i'm placed in an 
uncomfortable situation i failed and so all of  

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:36.720
a sudden god places a mirror and says hey you're 
running from me you know you're running away and  

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.200
so it's just challenged to me as i think about 
this but that's not the only wrong attitude this  

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.880
is towards the will of god right jonah towards the 
will of god but the next wrong attitude that he  

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.040
had was um towards and when i think about the will 
of god is only going to the places where it is  

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.520
comfortable right but when we look at the next one 
it's the wrong attitude towards the word of god  

00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:01.440
and so again the lord spoke directly to 
jonah directly to him and so jonah thought  

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.880
he could take it or leave it anybody ever read 
scripture that you didn't like and you're like  

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:14.240
i can just turn the page i didn't see that 
you know i mean maybe you don't say that  

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.360
but when we read it and then we walk away 
as though we never saw it aren't we really  

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:26.800
saying that jonah heard the word of god and 
walked directly from it so think about this  

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:33.760
when god sword commands us we must listen and 
obey disobedience isn't an option so why is  

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:40.800
disobedience not an option well for one god said 
that he saved you through his son jesus and you  

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:46.160
chose to accept that salvation to obviously be 
saved from your sins and to be a child of god  

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:53.040
and to be one also a light to the world and so 
when we've accepted that we've also accepted  

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.880
to follow god and obey god 
and what he calls us to do  

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.200
so for some of us it's we just don't we don't 
know the word of god well enough to know  

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.040
and so it's really what i would say is we're 
just knowledge isn't there but it's also we  

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.520
need to be in the word of god so that we can hear 
from the word of god right so jonah had forgotten  

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:16.160
what privilege it was to hear directly from the 
word of the lord and as believers we have the  

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:21.280
word of god full access especially in america full 
access not around the world they don't but we take  

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:27.760
for granted that the word of god speaks directly 
to us every day we've taken for granted for that  

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:34.400
and in luke 6 46 says this it says why do you 
call me lord lord and don't do the things i say  

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:42.800
and so just i start feeling myself associate 
really well now with jonah in this so jonah's  

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.400
response was not based upon the word of god but up 
based upon his personal feelings towards nineveh  

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.720
see this is where we start getting 
in the way is following god  

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.480
becomes secondary to our personal preference

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.360
and so you know i struggle with this as well  

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.880
because it's what i want to do and what i don't 
want to do and it's about me and and it's really  

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:12.560
not because my life has now been saved and been 
given hope and peace and comfort from the lord  

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:18.960
and so it's not about me anymore it's really about 
nineveh we all have a nineveh we all have a people  

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.960
that we struggle to go to and each one of us 
will answer that through this book we're going  

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.200
to answer who our enemy is and we're going to 
begin to pray god that we don't run and that we  

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:35.360
hear the word of god and that we actually respond 
in obedience not disobedience i remember thinking  

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.800
back to uh when we were in oklahoma and we told 
everybody when we were planting a church in  

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.240
cincinnati and i had a couple of my friends 
some people that was i was even discipling  

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.320
and remember saying hey we're going to cincinnati 
this is what they said we couldn't do it  

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:55.280
we couldn't go we wouldn't go and i kind 
of like smiled and i said okay um you know  

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.760
it's not easy to go but when god calls 
you to go somewhere you need to go well  

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.440
i wouldn't go i wouldn't go and i kind of just 
sit there and smiled again i'm discipling these  

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.200
guys and still a little bit young in their 
faith and i said okay this is their excuses  

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.240
i have a job i have a family i have a house 
i had all three of those things by the way  

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.800
um you know my family only lives here i had 
that one as well and i said so there should  

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.040
be nothing that stops you from following 
the lord wherever he calls you and this  

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.640
is really what i was challenging them with is 
if the lord truly told you to go you would go  

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.840
well what if you didn't go well we would have 
somewhat of a jonah story maybe not a well  

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.920
but there's god god will not let you sin 
successfully right so whenever god calls you to  

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:45.440
go somewhere maybe it's a cross to your neighbor 
there's conviction as a believer of the lord  

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:51.120
he'll place something in your life to say hey no 
you're called to go and whether you like it or not  

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.920
that's going to be placed in in your life and 
so the question is and we're going to hear the  

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:02.320
second this next point which will really 
kind of get you thinking but if the lord  

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:08.320
places something in your life like that 
to put you on the path to following him  

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.000
i would rather avoid that i'd rather just obey 
first because i don't know about you guys but as  

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.320
a kid i didn't like getting spanked or punished 
so as a follower of jesus it's kind of that idea  

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.840
and please don't take that the wrong way but the 
lord begins to chase in you or he begins to place  

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:30.640
things in your life to get you on the right path i 
would like to avoid all that together but thinking  

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:36.880
through this from my understanding of the lord's 
word is all of us are called to go just like jonah  

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:44.320
when we look at this in verse 2 god says get 
up and go i don't hear him just saying to jonah  

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.720
all throughout his word as he's telling every 
single one of us in this room to get up and go so

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:59.680
it's tough to go right it's tough to go sometimes 
to uncomfortable places places where maybe god's  

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.000
ready to forgive a people save the people that 
maybe you don't feel like they deserve it maybe  

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.360
it's to places that make you uncomfortable 
but the lord has called us all to go and so  

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.720
when you think about all these 
excuses that you have for not going  

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:21.200
they're just excuses that really we go back to god 
and god didn't have an excuse not to die on the  

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:27.120
cross for you and to save you and i think about 
that right i think about all that god did for us  

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.120
to reach us he didn't withhold his son's 
life to say i'm going to forgive you  

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:40.240
so if god's willing to do that for you how much 
more should you be able to walk across the street  

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.760
be intentional where you live be intentional 
where you work be intentional in your daily  

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:53.360
relationship with him those things are minimal 
to the sacrifice that god sacrificed for you  

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:59.280
to know him and be saved so those are the things 
i begin to build up for me is my motivation behind  

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.080
the will of god and the word of god in my life 
right the word of god and the will of god and it's  

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.840
those things where we forget where we came from 
as a follower of jesus we take that for granted  

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:15.280
and and we start seeing people as unchangeable 
i if somebody would have looked at me and i bet  

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.400
you if i went back and found somebody back in 
my teenage years hey could he be saved we're  

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:25.520
talking about believers i think a lot of them 
would probably be like nope he couldn't be and  

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.040
sometimes we view people that way we view people 
as they don't want to be saved they don't want to  

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.040
come to church they don't want to hear from the 
word of god they don't want to be loved and shown  

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.240
the love of christ but we view it that way and 
we already make a a really a judgment for them  

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.400
and so really what i started challenging 
myself is when you start viewing them  

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.120
in their future condition rather than their 
current condition because that's how god views you  

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.440
he doesn't view you in your current condition he 
views you in your future condition in heaven and  

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:59.680
i think about this one of my favorite things to do 
is to sit down with somebody who may be struggling  

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:06.160
maybe not following god where they where 
they should be or could be is to sit down  

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:11.280
with them and really believe in them talk with 
them help them see where god could take them  

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:18.560
help them see that god can give them grace and 
mercy and peace and hope to see their future  

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.760
condition there's more people in the world 
that need us to do that need to respond to  

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:31.360
the word of god and i think about this this is 
jesus example in mark 2 16-17 it says when the  

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.880
scribes and pharisees saw what he was saw that 
he was eating speaking of jesus with the sinners  

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.760
and tax collectors they asked his disciples why 
does he eat with the tax collectors and sinners  

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.400
when jesus heard this he told them it is not 
those who are well who need a doctor but those  

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:52.720
who are sick i didn't come to call the righteous 
but the sinners so look at jonah's circumstance  

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:57.840
tunnel was hanging out with his people just 
made a great prophecy about his people regaining  

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:03.920
reclaiming some of their property high fiving 
eating some good meals he's a prophet i mean he's  

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.960
got a high position why would he want to leave 
that i mean things are great but jesus reminds us  

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.000
that it's not the health right 
those who don't need a doctor  

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.320
that we need to spend our lives with it's 
those who are sick and hurting but then i  

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.120
began to ask this question in all reality aren't 
we all just a bunch of sinners and broken people

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.640
i think when we start viewing ourselves as 
something better than someone else it's the moment  

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.280
we get our heart wrong and why we don't want to go 
to other people is we don't place ourselves in the  

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.840
same brokenness that really they are and the same 
struggle we all are the thing is we have the cure  

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:48.800
we have the hope we have the answer that they're 
waiting for us to go share so too many times  

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:55.600
in church and churches that i want to continue to 
avoid inspiring hope is hey a lot of churches puts  

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.720
his sign on the door and they're not putting 
on the door but they're putting it in the way  

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.520
that they they run their services or the way that 
they act is hey clean yourself up and then come  

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:12.240
to church and the church is meant to be a hospital 
where we are already living in a broken world and  

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:18.000
a broken life where we're saying hey let me help 
you mend your wounds and you help me mend mine  

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.080
and you encourage me because i'm struggling today 
and and i'll encourage you next week because i  

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.400
know that next week you're gonna need it and it's 
that that picture that when people walk in this  

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:32.160
door and when they see us in the community they 
see not a perfect people but a hurting people  

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:38.080
that has a hope so those are the things like 
i begin to think about what this is jesus  

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.320
set the greatest example of where we're supposed 
to be where we're supposed to spend most of our  

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.040
time which is again with each other we're broken 
people but with other people who don't have the  

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.880
answer we have which is the hope of jesus right 
and this is this is tough right if we responded  

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:58.400
assuming let me tell you if god responded to us 
the way that sometimes we respond to other people  

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.320
have been saved that's a tough one i thought 
through that it's sometimes the way like i  

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:10.000
went on friday night so i can just be the one 
as the example of failure and why i can need  

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.840
to continue to grow and being uncomfortable is 
friday night you know what god probably told me  

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.120
if i acted like you acted on friday night not 
really connecting with people and just trying  

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:23.280
to meet them that you never would have been 
saved because you know i would have only got  

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:28.480
to one or two of the 30 or 40 people like those 
are the ideas behind like okay i've got to just  

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:33.440
change my heart my mind and on what god's called 
us to do it's the word of god that challenges us  

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:40.960
right and so too many times again the church is 
known for what they're against than what they're  

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.120
for i'm going to say that again too many times the 
church is more known for what they're against than  

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:52.080
what they're for i want to be four people i want 
to be for them where they are in their condition  

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.680
because i'm in the same condition in need of hope 
and a savior and so by the word of god i want  

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:02.960
to respond the way that jesus did right so all 
jonah's problems were caused by wrong attitudes  

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:08.080
towards the will of god right only going where 
i'm comfortable or towards the word of god right  

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.400
take it or leave a mentality pick and choose what 
i want to follow whatever is comfortable for me  

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.280
but the next one is an interesting one he had 
a wrong attitude towards the circumstances  

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:23.760
see the moment that jonah fled he seemed to be at 
peace and things worked out but the farther and  

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:29.040
farther he fled the farther and farther he went 
down and so let me give you some examples of why  

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.680
i mean that so it says he fled to joppa and he 
found a ship that was basically going as far  

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:39.040
away from nineveh as possible so one i'm running 
from the presence of god and success i found the  

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.080
ship that i was looking for i was able to afford 
going in the ship and if you look at verse 5  

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:49.040
he was able to go down into the ship and fall 
asleep into a deep sleep those are three things  

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:54.640
that would seem affirming to jonah running so i 
don't know if you've ever had this instance in  

00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:00.080
your life where you've maybe rejected following 
god in an area and things seem peaceful you're  

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:05.680
like well it must be the will of god everything's 
okay and so he had a false or a wrong attitude  

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.240
towards his circumstances right and the question 
is let me ask this question to you is it possible  

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.080
to be out of the will of god and have 
your circumstances work in favor anybody  

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.440
i don't know if you've ever had that happen 
they work in your favor things are okay same  

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:25.840
seem to be okay but let's look at numbers 
32 23 it says this but if you don't do this  

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.960
you will certainly sin against the lord 
be sure your sin will catch up to you  

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:38.160
this is just a reminder to all of us at some 
point running from god will catch up to us jonah  

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.440
gives us a clear picture of that 
because we're not there yet but jonah  

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.000
begins to have a storm in his 
life that affects other people  

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:52.640
he would rather die than to turn and go to nineveh 
so he's thrown off the ship he's eaten by a well  

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.920
and i wouldn't want to spend time in the belly 
of a fish for that many days that's disgusting  

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.800
right so i just think through these things 
i want to avoid the belly of the fish  

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.360
but sometimes we run from god and things 
seem at peace so the question is how do we  

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.840
know how do we know if a true again if we're 
following jesus daily conviction will come  

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:22.720
the fish will come the storm will come that will 
turn you back to the direction you should go

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.520
again lost or saved somebody who knows jesus or 
doesn't know jesus our sin will catch up to us in  

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.800
some some form or some some way to draw us back to 
the lord or to the lord and so if you're wondering  

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.880
why there's trials and storms in your life as 
an unbeliever and you're thinking there's no god  

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.480
because of these trials and storms though those 
trials and storms are to draw you to the lord  

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.480
and if you're a believer and you have trials and 
storms in your life it's it's also just reminding  

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.840
you that those trials and storms the only way 
to get through them is because of the lord  

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:56.320
because of the lord see jonah and i'm jumping 
ahead with this thought but jonah's on this boat  

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:02.720
and it's literally tearing apart and what what we 
don't a lot of times think about with the story is  

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.080
rather than being thrown off you know all 
jonah would have to do get on his knees  

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.640
and ask the lord to forgive him in 
that moment god if you'll save us  

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:14.400
i'll go back to nineveh and preach he didn't 
do that he said throw me off i'd rather die  

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.920
like sometimes we get to that point in our 
trials when we know we're really kind of  

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.360
running from our circumstances and we're like 
i'd just rather die i'd rather go through this  

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:31.520
than to go do what god called me to do i mean it's 
it's that that happens in our lives right and it's  

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.600
interesting right that that could actually happen 
but it can again jonah's story's there so he had a  

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.160
wrong attitude towards his circumstances right 
disobeying god doesn't immediately bring about  

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:46.080
consequences but eventually again as a follower 
we will the last one is he has a wrong attitude  

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:53.040
towards the lost this is one where it's really 
just pushing us towards jonah didn't only flee  

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:59.040
from his enemy because he didn't want to preach 
to them right he was abandoning them in their  

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:04.720
darkness and spiritual condition he was basically 
saying this hey nineveh i hope you go to hell this  

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.840
is exactly what he said when he ran i hope you go 
to hell i want to see you destroyed that is hard  

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:15.200
to think like it i mean you say hey it didn't 
say that in there but running if that's what he  

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.120
was called to do that's exactly what he was 
thinking his head i would rather see you go  

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.680
to hell none of us have ever thought of that 
probably towards somebody maybe you have  

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.840
and you have i hope the lord 
has walked through forgiveness  

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:35.680
i just think about this he hated the assyrians 
not just their sin but themselves them  

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:44.160
really just them as a whole but in 
reality we not do that when we reject  

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:50.560
living our lives out for jesus with those 
around us when we reject i'm not gonna go  

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.440
talk to somebody i refuse to go share the gospel 
i refuse to go connect with people are we not  

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.360
just saying i don't care about you because we 
don't know if they're going to live tomorrow  

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.120
and that's the thing conviction for me is i don't 
know that they're going to be there tomorrow  

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:08.640
so it's just that idea behind like where is our 
hearts and we we think that there's always a  

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.520
promise tomorrow for that person somebody else 
would do it but what if god's called you because  

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:19.840
they placed them in your life your neighborhood 
your home it could be your kids right and so  

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:26.080
he had this wrong heart and so i started thinking 
about this jonah lacked compassion that's really  

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:31.680
when we get this jonah lacked compassion to the 
broken and lost people of nineveh compassion is  

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.480
to be really this to empathize with someone 
who is suffering and then be compelled to  

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.000
do something about it right it's not just saying 
oh man i hate that they're in that condition but  

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.880
they're compelled to do something about it and i 
think of it this way when you're starving you're  

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:51.760
compelled to do something about it and until you 
do you'll continue to be in that state of hunger  

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:59.360
so jonah lacked that but we know who didn't it 
was jesus in matthew 9 35-37 jesus says this it  

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:04.640
says jesus continued around to all the towns and 
villages teaching in their synagogues preaching to  

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:10.560
the the good news of the kingdom and healing every 
disease and every sickness and when he saw the  

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:17.760
crowds he felt compassion for them because they 
were distressed and dejected like sheep without a  

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.640
shepherd and then he said to his disciples the 
harvest the abundant but the workers are few  

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.800
you know i saw this verse a little bit different 
this morning when i was reading over it  

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.080
he says the workers are few you know the workers 
that he's looking for you want to know why the  

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:40.480
workers are few the workers who have compassion 
are few i think that there's a lot of laborers  

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:48.720
that are capable to go out into the harvest 
and win the harvest to jesus share the hope  

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:55.200
but he's talking about this that the workers are 
few it's the workers who actually have compassion  

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:03.920
man it really hit me hard am i a worker that lacks 
compassion because the harvest is plentiful right  

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.360
there's so many people around us 
that are distressed and dejected  

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.800
that they're just waiting for somebody to share 
some hope with them show love compassion help  

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:19.920
them out be a friend listen to them man like 
so you know i'm getting hit in the gut as i'm  

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:26.400
studying through this i'm saying how can i be 
better so this is the moment again i ask this  

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:32.960
question and i make this statement really is how 
dare i lack compassion towards people they're lost  

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.680
that god has called me to and so whenever 
i'm disobedient to god's word and his will  

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:46.880
i'm fleeing from the presence of god when we're 
disobedient to the will of god and the word of god  

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.800
and really towards the lost i am fleeing 
from the presence of god just like  

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:59.040
jonah did to nineveh away from people god 
has called us to to share the message of hope  

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:05.920
so jesus has set this example we have no excuse 
right i'll just give you some examples but god  

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.800
do you know what they did to me how they 
act what they believe do you not know what  

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:17.280
i have to give up god my comfort my grudge 
my bitterness my control my anger lord i'd  

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:22.560
have to give up my self-centeredness see 
god did make these excuses in pursuing you  

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:30.240
he didn't in romans 5 8 it says but god proves 
his own love for us that while we're yet sinners  

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:37.120
broken and hurting people christ died for 
us god did not wait for us to get it right  

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:44.320
to die for us he came in the midst of our 
brokenness and he's still present in the  

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:50.160
midst of times when i'm still broken and not being 
a compassionate follower that he's called me to be  

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.840
so i just i look at this as we 
kind of finish up today guys  

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:01.040
a lot harder probably than maybe you would want 
the story of jonah to celebrate oh man let's look  

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:06.320
at jonah and kind of laugh that god did that to 
him to really look at the story and say man i see  

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:14.160
myself in this reflection of jonah that i'm 
running from the presence of god so just to kind  

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:19.040
of recap here all of jonah's problems were caused 
by wrong attitudes and maybe i'll just push this  

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:27.120
out of our problems are a result of our attitudes 
it's the will of god right towards the will of god  

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:32.720
it's only where it's comfortable is where we'll 
go it's the word of god we can take it or leave it  

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:40.160
yeah maybe it's our circumstances right maybe 
just disobeying god's become numb to you you just  

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:45.120
it's easy you just kind of keep moving on and 
you don't feel like it's an issue maybe it's  

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.840
just towards the loss right maybe you feel like 
you know who deserves to be saved and who doesn't  

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:57.280
maybe you feel like that that you know god 
will save them without you that's usually a  

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.080
lot of our excuses if i don't do it god will 
send somebody else but god wants to use you  

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:09.520
god desires to use you and you actually don't know 
that so we don't need to wait around to find out  

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:16.560
so as i look at these verses i don't know if 
you can relate i know they can relate to me  

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:23.120
and so here's the thing jonah was called to preach 
what are you called to this is i want to be clear  

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:29.120
this he said get up and go to the great city of 
nineveh and preach against it so you have to fill  

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:38.240
in that get up and go to the great house of your 
neighbor to the great co-worker of your employer  

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:46.400
to the great child in your home and maybe 
it's not preach as in what jonah did  

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:57.040
but it is to share to show compassion that jesus 
did where you can't help but do something about it  

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.960
i pray today we take some time to reflect during 
our invitation that each one of us asked this  

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:08.640
question what is god calling you to do to change 
your attitude towards the will of god the word  

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.880
of god your circumstances are towards the lost 
maybe it's one of the four maybe it's all four  

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.920
i don't know but only you know and the lord today 
i believe has has used and will continue to use  

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:23.840
this word to convict and draw us to go where god 
has called us to go now the question that i will  

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:30.560
leave you with is if god has called you as a 
follower of jesus which means you've given your  

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:36.880
life to him he has a place that he's calling you 
as a church we have we really believe this that  

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:44.240
god has called us as a church to inspire others 
to discover hope in jesus right to discover god's  

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.960
purpose for their life through a relationship with 
jesus so in essence if you go look in god's word  

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.120
all of us are have that call us to go help 
other people experience that hope in jesus  

00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:02.720
but if you haven't given your life to jesus 
you've got to get that first you have to get  

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:07.360
the relationship with the lord first before 
you can ever go for the lord you know a lot  

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:11.600
of times we want to work for god before we 
ever want to come to a relationship with god  

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.800
and that's what god wants you to do today so 
during this time of invitation as we get up and  

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:21.200
worship as we take some time to pray and consider 
what god's taught us in this word i'm going to  

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.200
stand in the back and to me that's where i want 
to stand each and every week for two reasons  

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.640
i want anybody that has questions about today's 
text if you're saying hey i'm confused can you  

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.400
help me with this or maybe you just need 
prayer over a certain area of your life  

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.600
maybe there's something in here maybe it's 
the will of god and you just need me to pray  

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:44.560
with you about you seeing the will of god 
differently come see me but maybe it's you needing  

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:50.720
to give your life to jesus i'm telling you 
don't leave today before you come back and  

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:55.200
talk with me i'm going to encourage you i'm going 
to use god's word to share the truth with you but  

00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:02.640
it starts with the relationship first and through 
that relationship god will help you share the hope  

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:09.120
of christ with others and help you fulfill your 
calling just like jonah was called to fulfill  

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:14.480
his calling and even for me this is the one 
that i'll even just challenge you with before  

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.240
before we finish i started thinking 
back to the end of ephesians when paul  

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:23.280
asked for prayer and here's what he asked for 
he asked for boldness to speak as he should  

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:28.160
so maybe that's what you need today you need to 
pray during this time invitation that god give  

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:33.840
you the boldness to speak as you should and 
to forgive you for maybe lacking compassion  

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.200
someone pray for us and we'll stand in the 
back i want all of us to stand in worship  

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.960
but please come talk to me if you have 
questions don't let today go by without  

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:51.440
seeing where your relationship is and how 
you can take a step forward so lord jesus  

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:56.720
we thank you for who you are lord i know today 
just even walking through this text even more  

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:07.600
as a church lord that that it's convicting to 
me and um lord i just pray i'm just gonna first  

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:12.880
of all pray for myself lord that you forgive me 
for missing the opportunities to show compassion  

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:20.240
to those around me in the areas of my life lord i 
pray that you um give me a second chance lord as  

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:25.360
you've given or more than probably than a second 
chance but the lord you gave jonah lord to go  

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:33.520
preach to nineveh so lord be a gracious god as you 
are and lord i just pray that each one of us lord  

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:40.720
can just receive your mercy and surrender 
our lives to your call in our lives to go

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.840
and be the light to the world

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.840
lord i just pray for a person in this room 
lord that may be struggling whether they  

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.920
have a relationship with you or not lord i 
pray that today that they make that decision  

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:58.720
to follow you that they make that decision 
to ask questions whatever their next step is  

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:05.920
the lord we just pray as a church that we are 
a church that is for the broken and the hurting  

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:13.600
and lord we are here to encourage them 
and open our doors and our arms to them  

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.640
so lord i just pray this all 
in your heavenly name amen
