00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.000
So if you haven't noticed, there's a couple things that I feel like are new today.


00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.400
Number one, we're kind of back to full service. We have everything set up,


00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.800
which I think was a new change, 'cause it's funny, whenever you haven't done this for a while,


00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.200
we all kind of came in and went, "What do we do?"


00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.600
It took us a little longer to set up, but it went really well.


00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.100
I don't know any major issues yet.


00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.380
And then we started what we have now,


00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.980
a nursery for our whole service.


00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.380
Which the first, I think it's a big step


00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.740
as a church to be able to offer nursery


00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.860
through the whole church service.


00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.340
And so, so thankful for those volunteers.


00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.580
And I say this every time,


00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.360
no matter if it's just during the whole service


00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.500
or half the service, when you go pick up your kids,


00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.700
like slip a 20 to some of the volunteers in there.


00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.020
And whatever you gotta do, you keep saying thank you.


00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.380
And some of you go in there next week,


00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.100
so tell them to slip you back the 20.


00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.260
But whatever it takes.


00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.420
I think sometimes when it comes to our children's classes, I know that they do an awesome job of taking care of our kids,


00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.260
supporting them, loving on them, so that you have the opportunity to be able to worship, the opportunity to be able to sit under the Word of God.


00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.260
And so I'm thankful for those volunteers and thankful that we get the opportunity to offer nursery throughout service,


00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
and so I think that's a big step for us in our church.


00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.260
So again, thank you to those who are serving in our children's school. I appreciate that.


00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:29.260
But we are continuing our series in Matthew, Matthew chapter 7. We've got a couple more weeks that we're going to cover through Matthew chapter 7.


00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.260
And then good news, I've been talking about the book of Genesis for probably about six months. I am jumping into it, the first week of September.


00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.260
We'll get about 12 weeks in at the fourth end of the year, and I think we'll cover a lot, and so I'm super excited about that.


00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.260
But we get to finish out Matthew chapter 7 today, so we'll be covering verses 13 through 23.


00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And today is one of those texts that if you knew I was preaching, you might not show up.


00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.260
And some of you probably are like, "Hey, I followed along enough to know where we're going."


00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.260
It's a tough text, and why I call it a tough text is it's pretty straightforward.


00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.260
What it is, Jesus doesn't hold back. He's very specific, and He points out some things that really are going to touch the heart.


00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.260
So I know for me it challenged me this weekend, and I know it's going to challenge you.


00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.180
But I pray that it challenges you in a positive way.


00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.740
And so as we walk through this, Matthew chapter seven,


00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.180
really we're talking about the end of Jesus' sermon


00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.100
on the mount.


00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.940
He's covered a lot of things.


00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.780
And he's beginning to teach his disciples


00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.980
and some of his followers about the coming kingdom,


00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.500
about the plan for the world,


00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.780
of his rescue plan for the world.


00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.660
He's teaching people how to live in this kingdom.


00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.860
And then today, he's really saying this statement,


00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.620
and this is really where I hope that maybe


00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.940
to try and draw some in here, is that Jesus is saying,


00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.940
you can't fake your way into the kingdom of God.


00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.820
You cannot fake your way into the kingdom of God.


00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.180
And that's pretty much what he says without saying it.


00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.020
But he's really trying to help us see


00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.060
what a true follower of Christ is


00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.860
and allow us to evaluate whether we are.


00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.820
And I'm not gonna ask by a show of hands,


00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.220
but I will say this.


00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.340
When we think about, if any of you have ever


00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.260
snuck into a place that maybe you weren't the right age


00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.300
if you had a fake ID and you were able to get in,


00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.980
or maybe you talked your way in.


00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.020
I'll give you a quick example of a non-bad way.


00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.060
The first time I ever took working on an unofficial date,


00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.100
we went to a midnight movie.


00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.100
Here was the problem.


00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.100
I wasn't old enough to be out after midnight,


00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.500
although I didn't know that.


00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.620
And so I had to talk my way into the movie,


00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.160
and I did, and I got in because he let me in.


00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.860
And that's kind of funny,


00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.420
but honestly, when we think about God,


00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.240
when we get to heaven,


00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.540
we're not gonna be able to talk our way in.


00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.700
We're not gonna be able to fake our way in.


00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.140
We're not gonna be able to pull out a resume


00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.020
of all the things we've done


00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.620
He'll prove the way we did it. No, He knows our heart, He knows our actions, He knows everything about us,


00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.820
and there'll be no way to fake our way in.


00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.420
And so, when we realize this today, that there's only one way to heaven is through Jesus,


00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.020
but He's gonna specifically point out that it's not only through Jesus, but it's through Jesus,


00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.620
and that relationship with Jesus is a faithfulness to God in His ways.


00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.420
He talks about following His will, and this can really come across today as a very works-based salvation,


00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.280
and I want to be as clear as I can on the front end,


00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.420
this is not what he is saying,


00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.260
but what he is saying is those who have given their lives


00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.580
to Christ will have an outflow of following his will.


00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.900
And if that does not reflect that,


00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.820
that may be a key sign that you have not


00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.620
truly accepted Christ.


00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.380
And that, again, is what he is trying to point to us today.


00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.900
And so, it's gonna really challenge us with this idea,


00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.900
does what I say, I believe, match how I live my life?


00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.060
Or is my life portraying something different?


00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.580
And I would even say it this way is,


00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.380
if I could not speak, would my actions


00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.460
portray that I follow Jesus?


00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.980
Would my actions portray that I follow Jesus?


00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.420
And so my goal today, I wanna be as clear as I can,


00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.060
my goal today is to not cause you to doubt your salvation.


00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.940
I would say this, there's some preachers


00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.160
that it seems like every Sunday


00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.100
that you show up to their service,


00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.780
they're trying to convince you you're lost


00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.380
so that you'll give your life to Christ again


00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.260
and again and again and again.


00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.220
And that's never been my goal as a pastor.


00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.780
But I believe that this text doesn't just necessarily


00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.220
cause us to doubt our salvation.


00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.620
That's not the goal, but really to clearly confirm it,


00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.060
or to clearly confirm the lack of it, if that makes sense.


00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.860
To clearly confirm it, or clearly confirm the lack of it.


00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.980
And as I was sitting back there doing worship,


00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.180
I wanna quote this verse, something just came to my mind


00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.020
as I began to think about


00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.900
what's my heart with this message?


00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.940
And I believe my heart with this message,


00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.260
and the message of Jesus is from James chapter five.


00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.900
says this in James chapter 5 verses 19 and 20.


00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.780
It says, "My brothers and sisters,


00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.200
"if any of you among you strays from the truth


00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.220
"and someone turns him back,


00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.580
"let that person know that whoever turns a sinner


00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.860
"from the error of his way will save his soul from death


00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.340
"and cover up one's sin."


00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.020
So I pray that as we walk through the Word today


00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.740
that that's my heart today,


00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.900
is that I'm able to be able to share in such a way


00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.660
that maybe there'll be one, maybe there'll be two,


00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.980
maybe there'll be somebody that you know


00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.820
that you need to go share with


00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:13.820
that will turn them back to God, and it will save them from the errors of their way, because God desires to do that every day in our lives.


00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:20.820
So let's dive into the message here in Matthew chapter 7, verses 13 through 23 is what we're going to read.


00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:28.820
So it says this, it says, "Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the road is broad, and leads to destruction,


00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.820
And there are many who will go through it.


00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:38.820
How narrow is the gate and how difficult the road that leads to life, and few find it.


00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.820
He says, "Be on guard against false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing,


00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.820
but inwardly are ravaging wolves.


00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.820
You'll recognize them by their fruit.


00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.820
Are grapes gathered from the thorn bushes or figs from thistles?


00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.460
In the same way, every tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit.


00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.260
A good tree can't produce bad fruit, and neither can a bad tree produce good fruit.


00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:13.060
Every tree that doesn't produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire, so you'll recognize them by their fruit.


00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:21.660
And then he says, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven."


00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:27.660
On that day many will say to the Lord, say to me, Lord, Lord, did we prophesy in your name?


00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.660
Did we drive out demons in your name? And did we do many miracles in your name?


00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.660
And then I will announce to them, I never knew. Depart from me, you all that know.


00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.660
Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we pray, Lord, that our hearts are open.


00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:47.660
Lord, to whatever you want to speak to us, Lord, I pray that if there's some of this room, Lord, that we be,


00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:53.740
And I would say spurred on back to the faith or maybe it's to be drawn to conviction of their sin


00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.820
To maybe just turn their lives over to you Lord. I pray that you change their lives today.


00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:06.680
So I want to give you a little bit of background whenever we think about who Jesus is talking to so when we think about Jesus


00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.200
Who's talking to his disciples or followers on this mountain?


00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.860
Many other people came


00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.780
What we are beginning to find is the majority of the people that are spending time listening to this message


00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:21.940
would be Jews. And if you know much about the Jews, if you study in the Old Testament, the Jews were God's people.


00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:27.940
They were set apart for a purpose to be a light to the world of how God has a special people in a relationship.


00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:32.940
That ultimately God wanted to be a reflection of what he wanted for all.


00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:41.940
And so as a Jew, they felt very privileged in that relationship or that idea that they were God's chosen people.


00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.560
So as he's speaking to these people,


00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.520
and Jesus is talking about the narrow way and the wide way,


00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.600
they would quickly assume we're on the narrow,


00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.120
we're the few, we're the remnant that God has saved.


00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.740
And so it would be easy for them to sit there and say,


00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.380
"Hey, Jesus is talking about us, like we're good."


00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.160
But I believe that Jesus is really trying


00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.920
to even speak to them and say,


00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.040
"Hey, you may be self-deceived."


00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.880
And what I would say is like,


00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.500
Today we're gonna talk about some,


00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:17.020
some, what would we say, teachers or false teachers


00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.020
that will be trying to persuade us away from Christ.


00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.560
But I believe the greatest danger


00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.220
that we're gonna talk about today is the self-deception.


00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.180
And so I started even thinking about this.


00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.420
What about us in this church?


00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.820
What about the world?


00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.420
What are some things in the world


00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.060
that maybe they're thinking that they're okay


00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.100
if they were to hear this message?


00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.740
Maybe us, what are we thinking?


00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.620
And this is what it is.


00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.280
Many believe they're good with God


00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.480
because number one, they attend church.


00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.520
They believe they're good with God because they're members


00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.960
or they were baptized at some point in their life.


00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.800
We'll find out that as we begin to talk with people,


00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.860
sometimes it's just because they give to the church,


00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.860
we're good.


00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.320
I've even heard people say this,


00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.400
I'm good because I was raised in the church.


00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.940
My dad was a deacon.


00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.160
My father was a pastor.


00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.580
I'm good.


00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.940
And so when I think about this,


00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.920
I think we can find ourselves easily beginning


00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.240
to put this line of things together of saying we're good


00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.440
because of X, Y, and Z,


00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.560
rather than truly understanding what it means


00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.580
to follow Jesus and what good it means.


00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.200
And so it is possible to know the right language.


00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.500
It's possible to believe intellectually the right doctrines.


00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.420
It's possible to obey the right rules


00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.920
and still not be saved.


00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.680
I'll define that a little bit more as we go on today,


00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.620
but understanding that, just saying the right thing


00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.560
doesn't mean that we're saved,


00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.620
doesn't mean that we are following Jesus.


00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.440
And so Jesus' message today is clear.


00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.320
you do not get an automatic passage into heaven


00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.980
because of being in the church


00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.960
or you fill in the blank with that.


00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.340
And if you don't believe that this message is already real,


00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.660
we're just diving in.


00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.920
It's a tough message, right?


00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.600
So the first point here that we're gonna find


00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.120
in verses 13 and 14 is this idea


00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.840
that few find the path to salvation.


00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.960
And this is hard to hear.


00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.740
And the reason why it's hard to hear,


00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.680
and this is where I'm gonna head off into, right?


00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.920
The first thing that came to mind for me is


00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.320
I've never heard somebody say when somebody passed away


00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.720
that they went to hell.


00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.540
I just haven't.


00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.080
You always hear they're going to heaven.


00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.560
You always hear they're my guardian angel,


00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.520
they're watching me down from heaven,


00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.600
they're in a better place.


00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.140
We hear those statements and that's not a knock,


00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.400
but what I'm saying is because that is peaceful to us.


00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.920
But the truth is that that person never truly


00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.600
surrendered their life to God


00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.160
and followed the narrow path,


00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.960
and that person is spending an eternity separated from God.


00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.360
that is hard to hear.


00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.800
But the reason why it's hard to hear


00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.360
is because the majority of us, including myself,


00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.040
will always want to make sure,


00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.240
we want to force our way into saying


00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.640
everybody's getting to heaven, right?


00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.480
In a way, we won't say that, but we'll kind of say that.


00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.680
And so this is saying that there is a narrow path,


00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.560
few find it, right?


00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.640
And he says this, that there is a clear path,


00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.820
a wide, broad, and easy to find path


00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.440
that leads to destruction, and he says many will find it.


00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.480
And so you wanna know the reason why many find


00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.380
the road to destruction?


00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.220
It's easy.


00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.320
It's a path of least resistance.


00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.320
It's the easiest way to go because it doesn't,


00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.480
means I don't have to change anything about my life.


00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.120
It doesn't mean I have to give up some of my,


00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.840
what I would say is the control over my life.


00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.860
It means I need to, you know, I get to make all the rules.


00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.380
If I go the easy way and assume everybody goes to heaven,


00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.020
then life's just, that's easier for me.


00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.780
And so he even makes that simple, right?


00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.000
It's wide, it's easy.


00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.240
It's the road that people know where to find


00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.460
and it's easy to follow after.


00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.820
But the path to eternal life is narrow


00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.800
and not many choose to travel towards it.


00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.640
Why?


00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.460
Why do you guys believe?


00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.840
I'm just gonna push this out to you.


00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.220
Why do you believe that the path to salvation,


00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:55.220
eternal life, is narrow and people hardly follow it?


00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.960
Why?


00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.480
It's challenging.


00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.600
It's difficult.


00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.680
It's hard.


00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.520
It's different.


00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.680
Let me just put that,


00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.840
nobody wants to be in a room full of people


00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.880
and look different where everybody's looking at them.


00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.160
We all like to be accepted, we all wanna blend in,


00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.880
we all wanna just don't wanna ruffle any feathers,


00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.300
we wanna just not look different.


00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.280
And so it is, it is difficult, right?


00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.480
And so a question to ask ourselves this,


00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.640
is when we gave our lives to Christ,


00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.960
Did it cost you something to give your life to Christ?


00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.080
And let me just add to that,


00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.780
is it still costing you something?


00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.580
I'll say that again.


00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.700
When you gave your life to Christ,


00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.960
if you did give your life to Christ,


00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.260
did it cost you something?


00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.040
And is it still costing you something?


00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.000
I would say this, is we cannot just rest on


00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.600
I was baptized this time,


00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.200
or I professed faith at one point in my life,


00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.280
but my life doesn't reflect it.


00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.240
We can't just go back and rest on our laurels.


00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.000
me and Matt were talking a little bit about this idea


00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.320
of laurels and this idea that we wanna rest


00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.400
on our past accomplishments or our past belief of,


00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.680
well, that was something I did then


00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.040
and I'm just kinda living my own life.


00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.700
It's something that we constantly, every day,


00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.880
are living and experiencing when it comes to our lives


00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.440
of following Christ.


00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.040
And so living a Christian life is not easy


00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.680
because there's a couple things that we have to do.


00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.080
Denying the ways of the world that is constantly


00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.880
trying to convince us to live selfishly.


00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.880
We are constantly fighting against temptations of the flesh.


00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.080
We're constantly challenged


00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.520
to put others' needs before ourself.


00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.880
And we're also challenged as followers


00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.920
to submit all our ways to the Lord,


00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.240
all of our ways to the Lord.


00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.080
And so it is not easy.


00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.880
It's not easy because there's many that will profess Jesus,


00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.360
but never leave the broad road to destruction.


00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.180
I'll say that again.


00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.100
that profess Jesus, but will never lead the broad road


00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.620
to destruction, because it's easy to profess,


00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.620
but it's not easy to follow.


00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.740
And we're gonna continue to walk through this,


00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.740
because I don't want you to just think again,


00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.300
work salvation on this.


00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.580
But I would say this, to have an easy Christian life


00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.400
means that there's no demands on us,


00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.860
which means it's okay, if I just attend church


00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.320
once a month, I'm good.


00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.620
If I let the pastor handle all the spiritual stuff,


00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.520
then I'm good.


00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.980
If I let everybody else in the church handle the evangelism,


00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.860
I'm good because God hasn't called me to do that.


00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.300
And then we begin to realize that we begin


00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.000
to make excuses after excuses,


00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.840
but I would say this,


00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.500
that the Spirit of God that lives inside of us,


00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.060
if we have given our lives of Christ,


00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.460
will not allow us to sit there and sit still,


00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.460
will not allow us not to follow the will of God


00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:50.460
because conviction reigns in and draws us back to God.


00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.780
And so when somebody would say this,


00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.820
how do I know if I'm saved?


00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.660
And I always ask the question,


00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.920
is there conviction in your life


00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.520
that consistently draws you back to God, to repentance?


00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.540
And if not, that may be a clear sign.


00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.140
Because if there's no conviction,


00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:08.180
then at that point, what is there?


00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.780
The Spirit of God is there to guide and direct us.


00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.820
So we know this, but we know the narrow road


00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.380
is more difficult, but I would say this, it's also better.


00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.700
Why do we choose the narrow road?


00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.540
It's better.


00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.300
And I'll just give you a simple example in life.


00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.180
Does anybody struggle with eating healthy?


00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.840
And everybody's hands raise up, okay.


00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.260
I would say this, I think many of us probably believe


00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.300
and have experienced the other side of eating healthy.


00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.900
You feel better, you rest better.


00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.500
Life, I'm telling you, perspective just changes in life.


00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.780
When you allow, and not just one day, just so you know,


00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:49.020
you can't eat a salad for a day and feel amazing.


00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.360
We're talking about eating healthy over time,


00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.000
consistently, you see the benefits of it.


00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.140
And that can be a wide range of things, right?


00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.520
We can talk about finances, when you budget,


00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.020
and you budget consistently, and you see the value


00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.680
of the reward of actually budgeting, all those things,


00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.180
right, you begin to see the better reasons why


00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.240
of discipline in our lives.


00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.440
And I may have just hit on two areas,


00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.120
you guys just don't, okay.


00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.360
That's not what salvation is, but what I'm pointing to


00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.700
is at times we go, but the narrow road is hard.


00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.780
but the narrow road is better, is greater.


00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.100
Why do we choose the narrow road?


00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.940
Not because it's easy, but because it's better.


00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.940
And I would say that most of our lives,


00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.780
we're consistently choosing some narrow roads


00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.480
towards a career path or some things that we're doing.


00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.320
Why?


00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.140
Because it's better.


00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.540
We know it's better for us.


00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.680
And so we choose it for those,


00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.220
but at times we don't choose it for the Lord.


00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.800
So what I notice is that at times,


00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.540
Most people don't like the idea of having to go through Jesus


00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.500
to experience that narrow road, right?


00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.040
It's easier for them to believe that all ways lead to God.


00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.020
And this is a reminder that we cannot fall into that trap.


00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.820
The word is clear that Jesus is the way,


00:17:58.820 --> 00:17:59.660
the truth, and the life.


00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.260
And at times, we're gonna have to swim upstream.


00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.620
Anybody ever tried to swim against the current?


00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.500
It is hard.


00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.380
Anybody in here ever watched The Chosen series, anybody?


00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.160
Okay, if you have, there's like three of you.


00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.460
But at the beginning, there's always this introduction


00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.980
and this really cool music, but these fish are swimming.


00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.460
And all of a sudden, you'll just start seeing this fish


00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.620
turn and go against the grain.


00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.700
And it's difficult.


00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.700
And there's very few of them,


00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.240
but they're working against the current.


00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.860
They're working against what the world


00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.220
is trying to challenge them to do.


00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.120
And so this road that God is challenging us


00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.200
to take, the narrow road, is open to everyone,


00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.860
but few will take it that leads to greater life.


00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.940
And there's gonna be more to this,


00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.220
so I'm just gonna kind of stop there.


00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.620
we'll finish up at the end.


00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.120
But the next section that we see here


00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.120
is it talks about in verses 15 through 20


00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.220
is that fruit reveals false teachers.


00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.780
And I begin to think through this.


00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.080
You know, it's beginning to challenge us.


00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.540
Take the narrow road, not the wide gate,


00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.580
the wide road that leads to destruction.


00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.980
And then it quickly goes into false teachers.


00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.420
And I begin to do a study and just thinking through this.


00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.920
And I've been teaching through books of the Bible


00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.580
consistently here in our church.


00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.520
Do you know there's like four or five different writers


00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.820
that address false teaching?


00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.180
If they're addressing false teaching,


00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.120
Do you think that that's an issue in the world


00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.680
and one we need to watch out for?


00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.640
And so Jesus is sitting here saying,


00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.960
the people that are heading towards destruction,


00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.280
many of them are being led there by false teaching.


00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.240
So he's saying, hey, if you're wanting to


00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.240
not head down the wide path,


00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.220
then you need to be on guard for false teaching.


00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.060
So let's look at this.


00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:31.960
I wanna read these verses again.


00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.880
Be on guard against false prophets or false teachers


00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.240
who come to you in sheep's clothing,


00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.680
but inwardly are ravaging wolves.


00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.800
You'll recognize them by their fruit.


00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.640
And then he says,


00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.840
"Are grapes gathered from thorn bushes


00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.040
"or figs from thistles?


00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.840
"In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit,


00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.500
"but the bad tree produces bad fruit.


00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.500
"And a good tree can't produce bad fruit,


00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.020
"and neither can a bad tree produce good fruit.


00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.920
"But every tree that doesn't produce good fruit


00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.980
"should cut it down, thrown into the fire,


00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.520
"and you'll recognize them by their fruit."


00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.520
So we're gonna specifically talk about leaders,


00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.680
but this can apply to the Christian life as well.


00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.440
If you're not producing fruit as a Christ follower,


00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.300
that's probably proof again of the fruit of your life,


00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.580
of no salvation or salvation based upon the fruit.


00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.920
But we're gonna directly talk about the prophets here.


00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.800
So he says this, "Be on guard, always look out for."


00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.340
And so when I think about this, being on guard,


00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.620
if you ever have watched the president go anywhere,


00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.200
number one, before he ever goes there,


00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.980
they send people out to scope out every area he goes to,


00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.100
because what are they being?


00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.860
On guard.


00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.260
Then he puts a ton of guards around him, why?


00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.200
to protect him from the enemy


00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.180
that they think is always out there,


00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.700
because you know what, there is an enemy


00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.100
that's always out there trying to destroy the leader.


00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.540
Does that not sound familiar?


00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.740
Like if they're doing that for the president,


00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.540
how much more should we as Christ followers


00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.300
know when we have a greater enemy


00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.000
that is out there trying to deceive us,


00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.260
to go down the wide path that we should be on guard?


00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.420
We should consistently be on guard.


00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.060
The question is, and that's what I wanna ask you,


00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.620
who should we be on guard against?


00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.320
Somebody start naming some people.


00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:15.420
Okay, the enemy, but let's start naming people in our life.


00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.500
I'm waiting for the first person to say it.


00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.560
Yourself, okay.


00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:26.280
You should worry about pastors.


00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:32.020
You should.


00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.900
And I'm saying this, standing up here,


00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.780
People who you give influence in your life,


00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:42.260
friends, family, if they have influence


00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.780
to be able to change how you live, you should be on guard.


00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.340
Now, don't be a skeptic and always just be like,


00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.100
and I'm not gonna believe anything they say.


00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.660
What we do is we test it.


00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.920
We evaluate it against what?


00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.500
The word of God, the spirit of God inside of us


00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.500
that draws us to conviction, whether this is right or wrong.


00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.860
So I've said this over and over again as a pastor,


00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.540
if there's a day I'm up here preaching


00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.300
and there's something that you disagree with biblically


00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.460
or conviction, please pull me aside and talk to me about it.


00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.860
I have no problem being able to talk about that.


00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.380
And don't be, here's the thing,


00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.440
and if you're surprised that I'm gonna defend myself


00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.940
based upon the word of God, don't be surprised about that.


00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.020
We may come to disagreements,


00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.420
but I would rather you, James 5, 19 and 20,


00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.860
I would rather you turn me away from destruction


00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.820
if I'm heading that direction.


00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.780
I think every leader that doesn't give anybody


00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.740
in their life that freedom


00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.440
is a leader you shouldn't follow.


00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.140
So that's one way we guard ourselves


00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.380
is when we see this, right?


00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.180
He talks about this, right?


00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.000
What happens?


00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.260
They disguise themselves as sheep,


00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.340
but they're inwardly ravaging wolves.


00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.380
So think about this.


00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.780
They look just like you and me.


00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.380
They look like they're a Christ follower.


00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.980
Then he says, they disguise themselves


00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.500
so that they can gain trust with you and with me.


00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.460
And then ultimately, they devour and destroy you.


00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.300
So what does it look like?


00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.780
Well, he says, you'll know them by their fruit


00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.560
or their ministry when we think about false prophets


00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.940
or false teachers.


00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.260
And so for the most part, they're gonna seem godly,


00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.860
but there's gonna be areas of their lives


00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.940
that produce ungodly fruit.


00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.700
He says, you cannot produce godly fruit


00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.700
from an ungodly tree, basically.


00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.280
And so some examples for false teachers.


00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.060
Number one, they magnify themselves above Jesus.


00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.100
And I would say this, or they magnify other things


00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.180
above Jesus.


00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.340
Number two, they want something from people,


00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.780
not for people.


00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.020
I'm gonna say this again.


00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.320
False teachers are people who want something from you,


00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.980
but not something for you.


00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.500
They want your money, they want your praise,


00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.560
and they want more followers.


00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:54.420
Number two, or three, there is three.


00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.840
Their focus is more on the works of Jesus


00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.680
than Jesus himself.


00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.660
So, you know, I love the works of Jesus,


00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.880
and I love the miracles of Jesus,


00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.120
but Jesus is the only reason that we are saved,


00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:05.960
not his miracles.


00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.940
His miracles may prove part of who he is as Christ,


00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.060
but it's Jesus.


00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.740
And this is the last one that I think


00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.720
that we need to stick to,


00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.380
their teachings don't match up to the word of God.


00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.100
That's why it's important for us to know the word of God.


00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.740
How do we guard ourselves?


00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.080
By knowing the truth.


00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.780
We've talked about this probably several times


00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.700
if I've preached.


00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.940
People talk about this with money.


00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.440
Our government doesn't study all this fake money.


00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.940
Now they probably do study it a little bit.


00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.320
They study more the truth, the actual money,


00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.820
so that when fake money comes in,


00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.040
they know when it's not real.


00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.460
As believers, we need to spend more time in the Word,


00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.160
knowing the Word, so that when false teachers,


00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.720
family members, friends begin to say things


00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.360
that are not the Word of God,


00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.680
that are heading down the narrow or the broad path,


00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.980
that you say, nope, that's not true.


00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.540
It may be hard to say no,


00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.980
it may be hard to stand up to them.


00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.220
I'm telling you, it is, 'cause I've experienced it.


00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.500
It is hard to stand up


00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.160
because you don't wanna cause controversy.


00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.220
You don't wanna be different, but at times you have to.


00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.480
And I would always tell people this,


00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.440
to be different doesn't mean you don't love them.


00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.220
If they believe differently than you,


00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.420
it actually means that you do love them


00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.980
and you're not judging them as we've learned with judgment.


00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.420
Judgment's all about restoration.


00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.340
So when we're making judgments,


00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.440
It's all about being helpful.


00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.660
So understanding that is important, right?


00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.740
So eventually these teachers who are on the broad road


00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.620
to destruction will be destroyed.


00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.340
He says they'll be cut down and thrown into the fire,


00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.820
but here's what's gonna happen.


00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.340
Those leaders, those teachers,


00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.820
those people that are influencing you


00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.020
that have had people that will follow them,


00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.420
guess where they're heading?


00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.340
Destruction.


00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.060
And that's sad.


00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.680
So when you look at this, I would say this,


00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.700
we have a responsibility as we were heading


00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.220
down the narrow road, as we are having people


00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.420
that are trying to influence us


00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.660
and point us to the destruction, right, the wide road,


00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.460
that we have a responsibility to help people,


00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.140
to not go down that broad road.


00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.420
I don't ever quote this to the T,


00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.460
but I know Spurgeon makes the statement,


00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.220
this idea that we should be known as Christ followers


00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.500
who are basically grabbing at people's feet


00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.620
and holding on as they are heading into hell,


00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.500
because we don't want them to go there.


00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.100
We should be people that are pointing


00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.580
and laughing and judging and saying,


00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:24.800
I'm glad we're the remnant.


00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.180
I'm glad we're the few.


00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.220
No, we should be the people that until the day


00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.100
that they die, until the day that they completely


00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.660
reject Christ, that we should have our arms around them


00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.500
and begging them not to go.


00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:45.460
So when we look at this, how do we prepare


00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.780
to know what false teachers are?


00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.460
I would say this, we need to be,


00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.940
I'm gonna shorten this for you, we need to be SFIs,


00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.560
Spiritual fruit inspectors, okay?


00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.380
SFIs, remember that one, spiritual fruit inspectors.


00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.340
Now, don't go out to the apple tree and inspect that,


00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.860
but how do we do this by studying the word of God?


00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.020
And this is a challenge to you.


00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.140
Psalm 119, 105 says this,


00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.700
your word is a lamp for my feet and a light on my path.


00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.940
I love how this sets up.


00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.340
Your word is a lamp for my feet and a light on my path.


00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.160
Towards what?


00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.420
The narrow path.


00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.800
That's what His word's there for,


00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.740
to help us see the narrow path.


00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.500
Because it is different, it is narrow.


00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.620
Sometimes it is hard to find.


00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.380
And without the word of God, we don't have the lamp,


00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.740
and without the lamp, we go to the wide road,


00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.700
which is the easier road.


00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.900
So God's word is so important.


00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.980
So then He goes back to, right, so He's talking about,


00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.340
okay, narrow road, wide road.


00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.300
Many people are heading to the wide road,


00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.620
few are heading to the narrow road.


00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:50.820
He says, "Watch out for these people


00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.820
"that are pointing you to destruction, to the wide road."


00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.800
And then he comes back to this and he says this,


00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.220
"Not everyone who says to me,


00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.100
"Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven,


00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.040
"but only the one who does the will


00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.440
"of the Father in heaven.


00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.780
"On that day, many will say to me,


00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.240
"Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name


00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.800
"and drive out demons in your name


00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.480
"and do many miracles in your name?


00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.800
"And then I will announce to them,


00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.660
"I never knew you, depart from me, you lawbreakers."


00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.200
I'll just tell you this, you don't wanna hear that.


00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.400
None of us wanna hear that.


00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.300
Many of us wanna stand at the feet of Jesus


00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.160
and hear him say, "Well done, good and faithful servant."


00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:30.720
But I believe that more people that assume


00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.880
that they'll get that statement,


00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.440
"Well done, good and faithful servant,"


00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.320
will actually hear, "I never knew you."


00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.200
And at that point that you would hear that,


00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.960
you have no ability to change it.


00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.540
You have no ability to change it.


00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.240
So this is really where Jesus is getting at.


00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.560
We cannot fake our way into heaven, right?


00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.580
Verses 13 through 21, enough, he continues on here, right?


00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.460
Jesus first says here in 21 that just declaring him, Jesus,


00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.680
as Lord will not get you into heaven.


00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.140
Just because you profess verbally


00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.260
that Jesus is Lord doesn't mean anything.


00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.140
And I've said this all along,


00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.060
at times where you'll catch me talking about love.


00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.020
I can tell my wife, Brittany, I love her every day.


00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.680
But I'll just tell you, if I don't support her,


00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.180
I don't encourage her, if I treat her poorly.


00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.300
Do you think me saying I love you a million times that day


00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.580
changes anything?


00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.340
No, my words mean nothing,


00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.460
but my actions prove my words.


00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.060
And so that's why I want you to hear this.


00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.860
Do works save you?


00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.820
Absolutely not.


00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.220
Jesus, your faith in Jesus,


00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.680
but your faith in Jesus does not leave you the same.


00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:42.460
It changes you and transforms you into Christ.


00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.580
And that moment of what Christ lived for,


00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.080
what he brought into this world,


00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.980
to have us experience this side of heaven.


00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.540
And so I would say this, that yes, absolutely,


00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.060
our actions prove our salvation.


00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.700
100%, it proves it.


00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.800
It does not make you saved.


00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.220
So it's not enough to just talk the talk, right?


00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.940
There's a lot of people who profess Jesus,


00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.780
but are pretenders.


00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.980
But he says, "But we must walk the walk."


00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.880
So Jesus says, what must we do?


00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.660
The will of the Father.


00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.100
And if you're anything like me,


00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.980
I'm this guy that's task-driven.


00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.740
So if Jesus says, do the will of the Father,


00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.460
and he gave me five bullet points,


00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.500
every day I would probably grab those five bullet points


00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.220
and I would go check, check, check, check, check,


00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.700
I'm good, right?


00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.660
But it seems at times where that seems


00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.700
to be a moving target at some point.


00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.140
How do we know the will of the Father?


00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.740
Somebody tell me how we know the will of the Father.


00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.200
The Holy Spirit, His Word.


00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:48.100
I say this, pursuing the Lord, a relationship.


00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.660
When I say a moving target, my life,


00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.520
I don't know about anybody else,


00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.820
my life doesn't look the same every day.


00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.460
Some days I'm here, some days I'm there.


00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.420
Emotionally, some days I'm here, some days I'm here.


00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.300
Sometimes Brittany's mad at me.


00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.380
She's always mad at me, I'm joking.


00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.780
Sometimes she's mad at me, sometimes she's not.


00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.900
What I'm saying is every day there's a moving target


00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.740
in the fact that our lives are constantly moving.


00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.040
Jesus isn't, so the constant is Jesus, the relationship.


00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.920
The constant is Jesus, you have my life, you are my Lord,


00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.000
and how I reflect that you are my Lord, right?


00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.500
Lord, Lord, how I reflect that you are my Lord


00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.860
is what is your will today?


00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:28.680
If I'm gonna go live and work and play and do whatever,


00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.280
what is it that you want me to do?


00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.280
And the word of God begins to say this.


00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.680
The Sermon on the Mount, if you go read it,


00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.200
He says, to be basically doers of the word,


00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.340
he begins to talk about how it is


00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.640
to live in the kingdom of God.


00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.040
So the word of God actually guides us


00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.720
to be again, somebody who serves first.


00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.500
Somebody who loves and forgives.


00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:54.140
Somebody who consistently portrays the light of Christ.


00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.040
Now, what you may be asking is,


00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.180
does that mean I have to be perfect?


00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.360
No, we're not talking about perfection here.


00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.440
We're talking about somebody who would profess Jesus


00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.960
and begin to live a life consistently without Jesus.


00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.220
Are there days I make mistakes?


00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.940
Honestly, are there moments that I consistently


00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:08.780
make mistakes?


00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.400
Yes, but conviction draws me back.


00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.080
Conviction draws me back.


00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.240
And so he's clear here, right?


00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.860
That we can't miss this.


00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.920
James 1:22 says to be doers of the word, not just hearers.


00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.340
We can't be the Christians who just wear


00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.060
the cross necklaces, profess Jesus when it's comfortable


00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.240
and beneficial to us.


00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.520
I would say this, obedience to the will of God


00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.860
is the test of a true faith in Christ.


00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.580
If you wanna know, am I a follower of Jesus today?


00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.420
A true test of that is whether you are obeying the Lord


00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.980
consistently in your life.


00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.740
There's some quotes that I've kept for many years


00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.500
and here's some that just really stick out to me.


00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.080
It's not the truths you know that matter


00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.780
or make the most difference in our lives.


00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.380
It's the truths that you obey.


00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.380
It's one act or one step of obedience


00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.300
is worth more than years of studying about it.


00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.180
What will end up happening is we wanna study


00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.500
year after year after year before we ever obey Christ.


00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.020
And I would say this, if we'll just obey Christ


00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.380
and whatever we have learned, even if it's just today,


00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.820
if we'll just obey Christ and whatever we learn,


00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.380
we'll change the world and we'll begin to follow Christ


00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.980
and he'll reveal more.


00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.940
But too many times we want to know more,


00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.980
we feel like we don't know enough.


00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.860
But it's important to remember that Jesus is enough.


00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.180
And that every day we have the opportunity to know more


00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.340
and begin to obey more every day.


00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.580
Every day we have the opportunity to do that.


00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.780
And I'm thankful, and I love this,


00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.020
when you guys keep mentioning the Spirit of God.


00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.340
Because what you've probably heard me say today


00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.220
is I've got to do all these things


00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.540
to make sure that I'm saved.


00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:37.820
And I would say this,


00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:42.280
the Spirit of God puts a desire in your heart


00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.600
to not do those things begrudgingly,


00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.300
to not do those things


00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.540
because you think that's what justifies you,


00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.540
but to do those things out of desire.


00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.860
You want to.


00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.240
You want to add a way to say thank you to the Lord.


00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.460
You want to because you know it's better.


00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:02.060
It's better for you and it's better for those around you.


00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.180
And I think it's interesting here.


00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.700
It's important to remember that our words


00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.220
are not a substitute for obedience.


00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.460
And even Jesus indicates here in verses 22,


00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.100
he even says this, I'm gonna read this verse 22.


00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.420
He says, "Didn't we prophesy and didn't we drive out demons


00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.420
"and all these things?"


00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:23.580
And it was them basically making this statement.


00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.060
They were confused.


00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.420
They were completely confused


00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.660
that Jesus was not allowing them into heaven.


00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:33.640
And I wonder if we would say this, we would be confused


00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.660
because we would say, didn't we get baptized?


00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:37.700
And I'm just gonna dive in a little bit deeper here.


00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.100
Didn't we teach in an inspire group?


00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.440
Didn't we lead a ministry team?


00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.460
Didn't we pastor a church?


00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.580
If those are the things that we're beginning to lay out


00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.740
before the Lord and he's gonna say this,


00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:49.860
depart from me, you lawbreakers, I never knew you.


00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.960
If every one of the reasons why we did those things


00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.340
was out of selfish gain,


00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.320
out of justification for ourselves


00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.920
to feel like we are coming to the Lord,


00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.580
we've missed the point.


00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.020
And so I think that is concerning to me


00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.540
and it challenges me today as we head into invitation this.


00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:11.140
It's not, today is not about you doubting your salvation.


00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:14.380
I'm hoping it's either affirming your salvation


00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.900
and that you're on the right path.


00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.660
I hope that if you veered off the path for a season,


00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.620
that this is convicting you to come back, to come back.


00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.500
'cause you know what our Lord does?


00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.420
He says he forgives those who come to him.


00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.660
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,


00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.120
I will give you rest.


00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.060
So maybe you've fallen off the path,


00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.660
and Jesus says, my arms are wide open,


00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.140
come back and experience the narrow path,


00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.540
experience my love and grace and mercy and forgiveness.


00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.380
But I also believe that today could be a day


00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.860
where conviction reigns,


00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.980
that you've truly never given your life to Christ,


00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.300
and that you know that if you do not accept Christ,


00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.420
you know where your eternity stands.


00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.640
And that is a tough statement,


00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.060
but I think it's also one that says,


00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.900
wouldn't you want somebody,


00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.740
if you're getting ready to walk in front of a bus


00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:04.180
and get hit, pull you back, holler at you,


00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.500
and if you chose to go in front of that bus,


00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.940
it's your fault.


00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.220
That's basically what we're saying today,


00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.940
is we love you too much to let you walk out


00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.660
in front of that bus without knowing what that means.


00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:16.780
So again, it's a wake up call for all of us.


00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.380
It's a wake up from pretending and complacency,


00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.320
from assuming.


00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.620
Being in church doesn't make you a Christian more,


00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.560
basically as much as being a car in a garage makes you,


00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.380
or being a person in a garage makes you a car.


00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.360
It's that simple an understanding today


00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.000
that we have to really ask this question.


00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Does my life or my profession match my life


00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.260
and how I'm living my faith?


00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.680
And so we're gonna go into the time of invitation


00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.460
and we're continuing to focus on invitation this way.


00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.840
We want you to take some time.


00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.560
I'm gonna pose some questions to you.


00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.980
You're gonna get an opportunity to just pray


00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.820
and seek the Lord.


00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.600
We'd love to be able to lead you in an invitation


00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.360
because this allows you to know,


00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.480
this is what I need to pray for,


00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.900
and then begin to just talk to God


00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.600
and let God minister to you and speak to you,


00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.520
and we'll pray for a little bit of time,


00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.140
and then we'll move on to the next topic.


00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.200
But my challenge for you, don't leave out of here


00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.880
without determining whether you are on the narrow path


00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.260
or the wide path, because today is a day of salvation.


00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.080
The Lord has brought this message for such a time


00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.480
as this for every one of us.


00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.780
So I'm gonna pray, and then I'm gonna start


00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.600
leading us through some time of prayer


00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.440
during an invitation.


00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.920
So Lord Jesus, we thank you Lord for today.


00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.560
We thank you for this message.


00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.760
God, I just pray, including myself Lord,


00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.920
I pray that you convict our hearts.


00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.320
That Lord, during this time of invitation,


00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.360
that Lord, as I'm leading this invitation for our people,


00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.920
Lord, I am also praying.


00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.080
Because Lord, I've seen some areas of my life, Lord,


00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.000
that maybe I veered off.


00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.920
So Lord, I pray that you bring us to repentance,


00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.800
you bring us to the loving arms of Jesus,


00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.200
that you help us, Lord, choose the hard and narrow path,


00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.000
because we know it is greater.


00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.300
So Lord, be with us as we go through


00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.500
this time of invitation.


00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.620
So here's what I want you guys to do right now


00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.540
during invitation.


00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.220
I want you to deeply seek the Lord.


00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.520
And here's the first thing


00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.360
that I want you to seek the Lord for.


00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.180
I want you to just ask the Lord this question


00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.420
and I pray that the Lord brings conviction in your life,


00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:09.340
one way or the other.


00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.420
Ask the Lord this question,


00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.340
Lord, am I on the broad road or am I on the narrow road?


00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.740
I just want you to start there.


00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.580
Lord, am I on the broad road or the narrow road?


00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.620
So just ask the Lord.


00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:21.200
(gentle music)


00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:35.700
So here's my hope is that the Lord responded to you


00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.680
in some sort of conviction of positive or negative.


00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.720
But now I want you to ask the Lord


00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.440
if you've been on the narrow road,


00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.060
is it you drifted?


00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.300
Or have you always been on the narrow road?


00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.260
So begin to just ask the Lord,


00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.660
Have I truly given my life to you?


00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.940
Is this just a time of drifting if I have?


00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.020
If you are on the narrow road, Lord,


00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.580
I just want you guys to say,


00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.180
Lord, just thank you for helping me stay on that narrow road.


00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.620
So just asking the Lord how you got to that narrow road,


00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.220
or if you were on the wide road, Lord.


00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.720
Just be present with the Lord and ask him.


00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:08.300
(gentle music)


00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.880
(gentle music)


00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:23.740
So here's my challenge,


00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.780
is whatever the Lord has revealed to you,


00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.940
if you've been on that wide road,


00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.500
I just challenge you to repent and ask God to forgive you


00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.500
and to help you come back to Him.


00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:37.340
I pray that if you're sitting there right now


00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.000
and you've been on that narrow road


00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.860
and you've been just heading in the right direction,


00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.320
just ask the Lord to sustain you


00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.760
and continue to help you stay on that narrow path.


00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.240
But just spend some time repenting


00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.640
and coming back to the Lord if you've drifted


00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.940
or thanking the Lord for staying on that path.


00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.540
Just spend some time doing that.


00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.120
(gentle music)


00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.700
(gentle music)


00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:02.280
(gentle music)


00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.380
All right, now I want you to just ask the Lord


00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:33.360
to just begin to remind you of people


00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.960
who have influence in your life.


00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.980
And then to ask him to help you avoid false teachers,


00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.180
false people that are speaking lies to you.


00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:47.820
Just ask the Lord to help you avoid those people


00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:50.020
and to stand up strong for your faith.


00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:54.480
(gentle music)


00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.060
(gentle music)


00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:22.880
All right, so the last thing that I just wanna mention today


00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.680
is if you're sitting here today in this service


00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.000
and you know that you've been living your life


00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.400
on the broad path,


00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.620
that you've never given your life to Jesus,


00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.120
then today you have the opportunity


00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.880
to give your life to Jesus.


00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.920
You have the opportunity to leave that path of destruction


00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.960
and experience the path of righteousness


00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.040
with a relationship with Jesus,


00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.100
the better path that's open to everyone.


00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.760
And so here's what I wanna do.


00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:53.340
If that's you today and you wanna give your life to Jesus,


00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.400
I wanna lead you in a prayer.


00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.900
And here's what I love about our church,


00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.240
no one prays alone.


00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.440
No one prays alone, but there's someone in this room


00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.700
that needs to give their lives to Jesus


00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.760
and turn to that narrow path


00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.080
and experience the life that Jesus has for you.


00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.840
I want you to just pray with me.


00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.760
And again, church, I wanna just encourage everybody


00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.400
to pray together to help those in this room


00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.680
that need that support to pray


00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.520
and ask God to come into their lives.


00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.500
So pray this with me, Lord Jesus,


00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.780
come into my life, save me.


00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:27.780
and forgive me, change my life,


00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:32.780
and help me move from destruction to life.


00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:37.960
Lord, be with me in the days ahead


00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.500
and save me from my sins.


00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:43.340
In Jesus' name, amen.


00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:46.480
So I wanna challenge you if you prayed that with me,


00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.040
if you believe that, that you will act,


00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.000
which means this, that you will tell someone,


00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.280
that you'll come tell me,


00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.900
that you will not only just profess your faith to Jesus


00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:56.740
through that prayer,


00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:01.020
that you'll profess your faith to Jesus in your life.


00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.460
And this is the one thing I love about our church


00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.980
is our church supports those who are going


00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:09.440
and choosing that life and taking steps of faith.


00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.660
God loves you so much.


00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:11.980
He loves each one of us.


00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:13.660
And so we're gonna take some time to worship.


00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.580
And here's my encouragement in this time to worship,


00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.180
to continue that invitation,


00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:19.940
to praise Him and continue to pray as you need to.


00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:21.460
If you need to pray with someone,


00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.980
I'm gonna be in the back, I would love to pray with you.


00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:25.880
But let's stand and let's worship.


00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.260
And praise the Lord.


00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.260
I'll stay.


00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.260
