00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.930
All right, so we are getting feedback.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.840
I kind of expected that earlier.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.100
It was really hot and I don't know
why, but Noah will figure that out

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.750
because he's the genius back there.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.930
Thanks, Noah.

00:00:16.997 --> 00:00:21.345
excited about week three of our evangelism
series called Practical Evangelism.

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:26.611
And, we have decided to walk through
the idea behind practical evangelism

00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:29.971
because of just really thinking
through as a church in the season

00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:33.610
that we are knowing also that Easter's
coming, just this challenge to be

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.810
able to get, a little bit more, what
I would say comfortable with sharing

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:38.250
our faith, inviting people to church.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.840
And as I begin to just think.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.100
My own personal experiences
with evangelism.

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:47.048
it's been messy over the years
because there's a lot of pressure

00:00:47.053 --> 00:00:48.438
that you feel in sharing your faith.

00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:51.588
And why do we share our faith and how do
we do it and how do we not screw this up?

00:00:51.588 --> 00:00:54.768
Because if I say the wrong thing or if I
don't know, have all the right answers,

00:00:54.768 --> 00:00:58.218
then somebody's gonna make fun of me
or I'm gonna be embarrassed, or they're

00:00:58.218 --> 00:01:01.188
not gonna know how to come to Christ
and all those things under our head.

00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:01.861
Okay?

00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:05.071
and what I also know, and this
is what I've learned as well, is.

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.086
Some of you may say, well, none
of that comes to my mind because

00:01:08.086 --> 00:01:09.136
I don't even feel like that.

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.456
That's my role.

00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:13.036
That's not even part of my life
to even need to share my faith.

00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:16.497
And so, we, we really started with last
week, just a couple of of different

00:01:16.497 --> 00:01:19.017
things of asking the reason why, and
actually it was a couple weeks ago.

00:01:19.017 --> 00:01:20.247
Why do we share our faith?

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:23.592
And, you know, this is something that
I, I've really, as I processed through

00:01:23.592 --> 00:01:30.072
this week, is we can talk about ways
to practically share our faith, but

00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:32.202
if we don't desire to share our.

00:01:33.342 --> 00:01:34.902
Or understand why we share our faith.

00:01:35.622 --> 00:01:39.282
We can have all the tools and
never even care to use them.

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:40.272
Does that make sense?

00:01:40.662 --> 00:01:45.462
I mean, you, you guys may be a lot like me
whenever I got married, one of the things

00:01:45.462 --> 00:01:50.742
that they got me for my wedding gift was
this like toolbox full of a lot of tools.

00:01:50.892 --> 00:01:53.082
And I get this and I'm like,
what am I gonna do with these?

00:01:53.382 --> 00:01:55.782
And some of you guys are laughing
at me right now because you're like,

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:56.712
you should know what tools are.

00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:59.682
I do know what the basic tools
are, but some of 'em, I was like,

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:01.482
will I ever use Allen wrenches?

00:02:01.842 --> 00:02:06.642
I mean, , I mean, and so what I mean
by that is you get this toolbox, and

00:02:06.642 --> 00:02:08.562
that may be you in the last couple
weeks you've been sitting here

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:09.552
listening to practical evangelism.

00:02:09.552 --> 00:02:11.622
You get this toolbox and you're
like, what am I gonna use this for?

00:02:12.012 --> 00:02:13.032
I don't need to share my faith.

00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:16.482
Well, later on in life, I learned
I needed all those things in the

00:02:16.482 --> 00:02:17.742
toolbox and I need to go buy more.

00:02:18.252 --> 00:02:22.609
And my hope is, that you will need some
of these things as well to help you

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.409
in your ability to share your faith.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.129
And you begin to see that God has equipped
you and designed you and called you to

00:02:28.134 --> 00:02:29.539
share your faith with those around you.

00:02:30.664 --> 00:02:32.524
Let me just kind of
catch you up on the why.

00:02:32.524 --> 00:02:34.414
So we, we started thinking through
why did we share our faith?

00:02:34.414 --> 00:02:39.601
Number one, if you've given your life to
Christ, it is what God calls us to do.

00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:41.561
And for some of you that
may sound like a chore.

00:02:41.585 --> 00:02:44.666
and what I would say is that God
called you for a purpose, right?

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.699
it's a statement of how
did you hear the gospel?

00:02:47.704 --> 00:02:49.649
If you gave your life to Christ,
how'd you hear the gospel?

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:51.509
Somebody had to share.

00:02:52.454 --> 00:02:55.244
, some of you may be the very few
that just jumped in the word of God

00:02:55.244 --> 00:02:57.254
and the Word of God convicted you
and you gave your life to Christ.

00:02:57.254 --> 00:03:00.494
But those of you who have have
probably heard it from someone.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:05.744
So I would say this, God calls us to
do that because how will they hear?

00:03:05.744 --> 00:03:08.324
How will somebody else hear
if we don't share the gospel?

00:03:08.324 --> 00:03:11.414
Number two, it is a natural outflow
of our relationship with Jesus.

00:03:11.414 --> 00:03:14.984
I would just say this, that when we
spend time with God, if we have a

00:03:14.984 --> 00:03:19.964
relationship with Jesus, it naturally
comes out of our life to share our faith

00:03:19.994 --> 00:03:21.434
because it is just something that we.

00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:25.591
number three we talked about it's because
we understand the consequences of sin

00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:27.961
and we understand the consequences
of living separated from God.

00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:30.661
And so because I call that conviction,
we are convicted, that we need

00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:33.691
to share of faith because we know
those that don't know Christ.

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:36.234
the consequences of living in
eternity separated from God.

00:03:36.714 --> 00:03:40.104
And the last one is, I would say
this is the major one, the desire.

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:42.863
we desire to see people experience
a same relationship with Jesus.

00:03:42.863 --> 00:03:46.973
And, and it comes back to this as
if God has so transformed your life.

00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:52.973
If, and I say that, If God has so
transformed your life, you desire for

00:03:52.973 --> 00:03:55.493
other people to be transformed as well.

00:03:55.553 --> 00:03:56.033
Amen.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:57.293
I would hope so.

00:03:58.133 --> 00:04:01.223
And, and, and where you may stand,
and I'm kind of gonna take a little

00:04:01.223 --> 00:04:04.493
extra time on this and I'm, I'm
really thinking through this.

00:04:05.183 --> 00:04:10.073
You may be in a season of your faith where
you don't have that desire to share your

00:04:10.073 --> 00:04:14.243
faith, because right now you're struggling
with the desire to follow Jesus.

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:20.213
and some of us may not honestly want to
admit that we have had struggles with sh

00:04:20.243 --> 00:04:22.493
with, with just a relationship with Jesus.

00:04:22.534 --> 00:04:25.615
we, we believe, but we've had struggles.

00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:28.405
And so I want to just un, I
wanna sit with you just for a

00:04:28.405 --> 00:04:29.575
minute and say, Hey, I get it.

00:04:30.385 --> 00:04:34.735
Even as a pastor, there are moments
where I'm like, man, I'm just

00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:39.655
struggling with my own faith,
let alone the desire to go share.

00:04:39.673 --> 00:04:43.903
and so if you're in that season
number one, God sees you, God cares.

00:04:44.383 --> 00:04:45.283
You're not the only one.

00:04:45.283 --> 00:04:46.753
The enemy wants you to
think you're the only one.

00:04:47.263 --> 00:04:51.433
But my prayer is that in that season
that you are struggling, that you

00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:55.663
will dive deeper into the Lord and
you will strive to cling to the Lord

00:04:55.663 --> 00:04:57.103
and that the Lord guide you in this.

00:04:57.103 --> 00:05:00.973
And then also what I would say at
times, whenever I am shirling with my

00:05:00.973 --> 00:05:06.823
own personal faith, getting my eyes off
of me and getting my eyes on others.

00:05:07.783 --> 00:05:10.933
has helped me overcome that as well
because then I start seeing people who

00:05:10.933 --> 00:05:14.503
don't know Christ and I start realizing
how much I do have and how much the

00:05:14.503 --> 00:05:15.863
Lord has been present in my life.

00:05:15.874 --> 00:05:18.664
and so let me just kind of catch
you up on what we have talked

00:05:18.664 --> 00:05:19.744
about with practical evangels.

00:05:19.744 --> 00:05:24.304
In week one, we talked about the
following Jesus and his example is one

00:05:24.304 --> 00:05:26.134
of the greatest ways to share our faith.

00:05:26.164 --> 00:05:30.454
When we looked into the word we saw,
Jesus gave one of the greatest examples

00:05:30.454 --> 00:05:31.804
of how to share his faith, right?

00:05:31.804 --> 00:05:34.594
How to share who he was with
other people and the result of.

00:05:35.674 --> 00:05:39.514
But what we also saw is that the
more and more time that we spend

00:05:39.514 --> 00:05:45.244
with Jesus, it becomes a natural
response to share our faith.

00:05:45.694 --> 00:05:49.054
And, and I would say this has
anybody here, and maybe you

00:05:49.054 --> 00:05:52.414
haven't been, but has anybody here
been watching N NCAA basketball?

00:05:52.414 --> 00:05:53.014
The last couple days?

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.264
If you filled out a bracket,
anybody filled out a bracket?

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:55.684
Okay.

00:05:55.684 --> 00:05:59.404
If you filled out a bracket,
you're probably talking to somebody

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:00.454
else to fill out a bracket.

00:06:00.544 --> 00:06:00.784
Right?

00:06:00.784 --> 00:06:01.774
And it's the simple things.

00:06:01.774 --> 00:06:04.054
You literally, you know, I like,
I don't really care about basket.

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:08.659
But I do right now because I filled
out a bracket and my son Sterling,

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.559
who's five who I just told him the
names of the teams and he wrote down,

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:13.909
he told me which one to write down.

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:20.479
Picked the 16 to beat the one . Just
telling you, it's all luck.

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.689
But I'll just tell you this, it's
got me into a lot of conversations

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:29.149
because I've spent time thinking
about it, watching some of the

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:31.129
games and having conversations.

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:33.919
So when we spend time with
Jesus, it is a natural out.

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:36.163
Of, our lives.

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:40.123
And whenever you're, again, we go back to
this idea of sharing our faith is scary.

00:06:40.187 --> 00:06:41.957
I really started thinking
about this this week.

00:06:41.957 --> 00:06:47.117
Matthew 10 19 through 20 says this, don't
worry about what you are to speak for.

00:06:47.122 --> 00:06:51.017
You will be given what to say at that hour
because it isn't you speaking, but the

00:06:51.017 --> 00:06:52.817
spirit of your father who is speaking.

00:06:53.447 --> 00:06:56.687
And so when we do have that fear
of what to say, remember that the

00:06:56.687 --> 00:06:57.887
Lord is the one who guides us.

00:06:57.887 --> 00:06:59.297
So our goal from week one is for.

00:07:00.662 --> 00:07:03.932
that the key to sharing our faith is to
have a daily relationship with Jesus.

00:07:03.932 --> 00:07:05.702
That's where it starts, right?

00:07:05.702 --> 00:07:09.572
And then we begin to kind of grow into
that The following week, which was

00:07:09.572 --> 00:07:14.582
last week, week two, we said this, that
the importance of living in community,

00:07:14.597 --> 00:07:19.697
is, is how we are able to effectively
evangelize or to share our faith.

00:07:19.937 --> 00:07:20.657
And so we learned two.

00:07:21.452 --> 00:07:25.712
number one, living in community encourages
us and prepares us to share our faith.

00:07:25.802 --> 00:07:29.642
Living in community prepares us and
encourages us to share our faith.

00:07:29.942 --> 00:07:33.272
And so when we looked at Acts chapter
two, we saw a couple of things.

00:07:33.272 --> 00:07:37.442
Number one, that the community that they
devoted themselves to, that they were

00:07:37.447 --> 00:07:39.512
inspired and encouraged in their faith.

00:07:39.822 --> 00:07:44.912
Number two, that they were able to
experience peace within and unity

00:07:44.917 --> 00:07:46.262
within the group that they spent time.

00:07:47.087 --> 00:07:49.772
They also saw, people's
needs being met, right?

00:07:49.772 --> 00:07:52.022
And, and how generous people were.

00:07:52.322 --> 00:07:56.992
And because of the things that they
experienced in this community, it prepared

00:07:56.997 --> 00:08:00.662
them to share with the world around them
the things that they were experiencing.

00:08:00.662 --> 00:08:01.952
It was the overflow.

00:08:02.012 --> 00:08:07.022
So as they spent time together, the
world saw what was happening and they

00:08:07.022 --> 00:08:10.232
begin to share what was happening more.

00:08:10.322 --> 00:08:14.327
And then we learned the second part here
is that living a community, Gives us

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.067
opportunities to practically evangelize.

00:08:16.217 --> 00:08:21.407
What we saw in Acts chapter two was
the Lord gave favor to the people who

00:08:21.407 --> 00:08:23.117
were gathering together consistently.

00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:27.257
People who were gathering together
consistently, who were meeting and being

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:31.607
in peace and encouraging and inspiring
one another and challenging one another.

00:08:32.087 --> 00:08:36.827
God gave favor to all people, and then
it says that there was many who were

00:08:36.827 --> 00:08:40.247
coming to faith in Christ because of
that community gathering together.

00:08:40.727 --> 00:08:41.957
So we were challenged by this.

00:08:43.412 --> 00:08:48.002
Of seeing the value and the importance
of living in community with one another.

00:08:48.002 --> 00:08:48.212
Right?

00:08:48.212 --> 00:08:50.462
So following Jesus helps
us share our faith.

00:08:50.672 --> 00:08:54.362
Living in community gives us opportunities
and prepares us to share our faith.

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:55.982
And this, and this is this moment.

00:08:55.987 --> 00:08:58.772
I know we're gonna talk more
today about it, but you ever

00:08:58.777 --> 00:08:59.792
wonder if something's gonna work?

00:08:59.792 --> 00:09:02.462
You ever have somebody tell you if you'll
do this, this, and this, it's gonna work?

00:09:02.467 --> 00:09:03.393
And they're like, I don't know.

00:09:04.622 --> 00:09:08.492
And, and, and my my thing
is, is if you ever wonder if.

00:09:08.747 --> 00:09:09.137
It.

00:09:09.137 --> 00:09:10.097
Can I share my faith?

00:09:10.097 --> 00:09:12.437
Is somebody gonna actually
receive the gospel?

00:09:12.437 --> 00:09:13.727
Is somebody gonna actually come to church?

00:09:13.727 --> 00:09:17.087
Is somebody gonna actually make
sense of what I'm sharing with him?

00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:20.417
I believe that if we even just
tried those first few things, we

00:09:20.417 --> 00:09:21.977
begin to follow Jesus consistently.

00:09:21.982 --> 00:09:24.137
We begin to live in community,
that God will give you the

00:09:24.137 --> 00:09:25.097
opportunity to share your faith.

00:09:25.397 --> 00:09:28.727
God will allow people to come
to faith in Christ through that.

00:09:29.297 --> 00:09:30.767
And, and I always love this about God.

00:09:30.767 --> 00:09:32.687
He says, try me, test me in.

00:09:33.467 --> 00:09:37.157
And, and, and if you're anything like me,
I'd rather sometimes sit on the other side

00:09:37.157 --> 00:09:41.237
and make up all the reasons why something
won't work rather than just trying it.

00:09:41.837 --> 00:09:44.327
And typically, Brittany, my wife,
is usually the one that just

00:09:44.332 --> 00:09:45.917
says, quit talking about it.

00:09:46.217 --> 00:09:47.057
Just go do it.

00:09:47.777 --> 00:09:49.067
And then you can figure it out after then.

00:09:49.067 --> 00:09:50.717
And I'm like, oh, I guess that's right.

00:09:51.347 --> 00:09:54.047
So I'm hoping that those first two
things encourage you, but this week

00:09:54.047 --> 00:09:58.427
we're gonna discuss how serving others
will open the door for us to share.

00:09:59.072 --> 00:10:01.742
Serving others will open the
door for us to share our faith.

00:10:01.952 --> 00:10:04.769
And I love how God, really
worked this out this week for me.

00:10:04.769 --> 00:10:05.579
We had a mission team.

00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:08.909
If you were here last Sunday, we had a
mission team in from Knoxville, Tennessee.

00:10:09.299 --> 00:10:12.239
They spent the week serving our community
and I could serve alongside them.

00:10:12.599 --> 00:10:17.279
And I saw the result of serving our
community and how God opened the doors.

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:19.739
And so God used that this week
to be able to even drive right

00:10:19.739 --> 00:10:21.449
into this message this week.

00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:24.119
But I wanted to encourage you
with this before we jump into the.

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:29.264
That when we serve people, it's not
this idea behind bait and switch.

00:10:29.264 --> 00:10:32.264
And, and let me give you kind of the,
the reason why this, I remember when we

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:35.684
first started reaching out to schools to
see if we could bring breakfast to them.

00:10:36.104 --> 00:10:40.819
I had one school in particular that,
when I called them, they said, Hey,

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:43.219
yeah, we would love for you to bring
in breakfast and this is during kind

00:10:43.219 --> 00:10:47.269
of the covid season, but you can't
come in and hand those sandwiches out.

00:10:47.274 --> 00:10:51.589
So if, if that's what you have to have
where you come in and, and do that,

00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:52.909
then then don't worry about bringing b.

00:10:53.704 --> 00:10:59.524
And I just remember thinking what
they're saying is if you require,

00:10:59.554 --> 00:11:03.454
like basically we'll give this
gift if you get to do this, and I'm

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:04.564
like, man, that's not the church.

00:11:04.569 --> 00:11:06.634
We are, we're a church that
says, Hey, here you go.

00:11:06.904 --> 00:11:09.064
And we just brought sandwiches,
son outside the door, walked away.

00:11:09.754 --> 00:11:12.184
I didn't care about the credit, I
didn't care about getting in there

00:11:12.184 --> 00:11:14.164
and being able to make sure we got
to share our faith with people.

00:11:14.344 --> 00:11:15.394
It was all about serving.

00:11:15.604 --> 00:11:17.884
So when we serve, it's not like
I'm gonna serve you to make

00:11:17.884 --> 00:11:19.204
sure that I get Jesus to you.

00:11:19.864 --> 00:11:22.774
I'm just serving, we're just
serving as a church, as the out.

00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:25.099
Of our relationship with Jesus.

00:11:25.159 --> 00:11:27.829
And then Jesus gives us the
opportunity to share our faith

00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:29.299
because that's what he does.

00:11:29.479 --> 00:11:31.939
So it's gonna be cool how we get to
see how God talks about this today

00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:36.379
through His word, but then also some
examples in our church and in this

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:38.863
past week, about how God has done that.

00:11:38.863 --> 00:11:40.483
So we're gonna be in Matthew.

00:11:40.573 --> 00:11:41.533
I should have told you this beginning.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.273
We're gonna be in Matthew chapter 20.

00:11:44.293 --> 00:11:46.123
So I'll give you just a couple
of minutes to turn there.

00:11:46.123 --> 00:11:46.903
Matthew chapter 20.

00:11:46.903 --> 00:11:48.403
We will also have it up behind us.

00:11:48.763 --> 00:11:50.923
So Matthew chapter 20,
we're gonna start in verse.

00:11:51.733 --> 00:11:55.093
And the first few verses are not gonna
really make sense to you, but we're

00:11:55.093 --> 00:11:57.763
gonna kind of summarize this and it's
gonna make sense of how all this drives

00:11:57.763 --> 00:11:59.292
together, when it comes to serving.

00:11:59.292 --> 00:12:00.402
So here we go.

00:12:00.402 --> 00:12:03.912
Matthew chapter 20, starting
to in verse 20, it says this.

00:12:04.152 --> 00:12:09.012
Then the mother, ABEB sons approached
him with her sons and she knelt

00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:10.332
down to ask him for something.

00:12:11.142 --> 00:12:13.662
Speaking of Jesus, what do you want?

00:12:13.722 --> 00:12:16.392
He asked her, she said, promise.

00:12:16.722 --> 00:12:17.112
Promise.

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:19.482
She said to him that these
two sons of mine may.

00:12:20.412 --> 00:12:25.062
One on your right and one on your left
in the kingdom and Jesus answered,

00:12:25.212 --> 00:12:26.532
you don't know what you're asking.

00:12:26.742 --> 00:12:28.962
Are you able to drink the
cup that I'm about to drink?

00:12:29.472 --> 00:12:32.742
And we are able, they said, and he
told them, you will indeed drink my

00:12:32.742 --> 00:12:36.642
cup, but to sit on my right and to
sit on my left is not mine to give.

00:12:36.647 --> 00:12:40.422
Instead it is for those whom it
has been prepared by my father.

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:45.567
And when the 10 disciples heard this,
they became indignant with the two other

00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:50.127
brothers, and Jesus called them over and
said, you know that the rulers of the

00:12:50.127 --> 00:12:54.327
Gentiles lorded over them and those in
high positions act as tyrants over them.

00:12:54.747 --> 00:12:56.847
It must not be like this among you.

00:12:57.177 --> 00:13:00.717
On the contrary, whoever wants to be
great among you must be your servant

00:13:00.897 --> 00:13:05.577
and whoever wants to be first, you
must beat your slave just as the son

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:10.017
of man did not come to serve, but to
serve and to give his life as a ran.

00:13:10.592 --> 00:13:11.262
Amening.

00:13:11.352 --> 00:13:12.552
Let's take some time to pray.

00:13:12.552 --> 00:13:14.652
Lord Jesus, we just thank
you, Lord, for today.

00:13:14.922 --> 00:13:17.562
We thank you for your word and
we are praying, Lord, that our

00:13:17.562 --> 00:13:20.892
hearts and minds are opened to what
you have to share with us today.

00:13:20.892 --> 00:13:24.072
Lord, may we leave outta here changed
and inspired to go share our faith

00:13:24.072 --> 00:13:27.072
through serving those around us, and
we pray this in your heaven name.

00:13:27.492 --> 00:13:27.852
Amen.

00:13:28.722 --> 00:13:32.172
So, so the first thing here that
we see in this text is we have been

00:13:32.172 --> 00:13:34.872
called to serve, not to be served.

00:13:35.352 --> 00:13:37.632
And the question is, Why?

00:13:38.142 --> 00:13:39.472
So two questions.

00:13:39.477 --> 00:13:44.052
Number one, if serving someone would
save their life, would you do it?

00:13:45.582 --> 00:13:46.632
Wow, three people.

00:13:46.692 --> 00:13:48.882
The rest of you just
rather let people die.

00:13:49.752 --> 00:13:52.512
, I love, here's the thing, I know
you guys, this is in your mind.

00:13:52.517 --> 00:13:56.322
You're going, I'm not raising my hand
cuz it doesn't really matter right now.

00:13:56.472 --> 00:13:57.912
Somebody just died cuz you
wouldn't raise your hand.

00:13:58.812 --> 00:13:59.382
. Wow.

00:14:00.912 --> 00:14:01.422
There we go.

00:14:01.422 --> 00:14:01.992
There we go.

00:14:01.992 --> 00:14:02.232
See?

00:14:02.232 --> 00:14:02.682
Thanks.

00:14:02.712 --> 00:14:03.612
Now he's got two hands.

00:14:03.612 --> 00:14:04.332
He made one up for.

00:14:05.652 --> 00:14:07.092
So let's just take it.

00:14:07.122 --> 00:14:10.842
I say take it step down a little bit,
but I say this actually take a step up.

00:14:11.292 --> 00:14:15.672
What if serving someone could lead
them to salvation, would you do it?

00:14:17.172 --> 00:14:20.502
See, now, I would say most of you,
the first one makes logical sense

00:14:20.862 --> 00:14:23.142
because death and life is a big deal.

00:14:24.162 --> 00:14:28.692
But then when we think about eternity,
a lot of times it's like, well, if I

00:14:28.692 --> 00:14:31.542
would serve them, as long as I wouldn't
be uncomfortable, I would serve them.

00:14:31.542 --> 00:14:33.492
As long as it wouldn't cause
me to sacrifice too much.

00:14:34.242 --> 00:14:40.302
Money, effort, whatever you name it and
you, the thing is, we don't, you're law

00:14:40.302 --> 00:14:41.652
like me, we don't say this verbally.

00:14:41.652 --> 00:14:43.572
If I was in a conversation,
you wouldn't admit that.

00:14:43.722 --> 00:14:47.322
But internally we will say that
sometimes is where if, if, will I

00:14:47.322 --> 00:14:50.592
serve someone, will I do something
and go above and beyond in order for

00:14:50.592 --> 00:14:51.387
someone to come to faith in Christ?

00:14:52.122 --> 00:14:54.402
And that's really the challenge
today, whenever Jesus is

00:14:54.792 --> 00:14:55.632
challenging us through this word.

00:14:55.662 --> 00:14:58.122
I wanna give you just kind
of an example of why serving

00:14:58.332 --> 00:14:59.952
plays a big part of my heart.

00:15:00.642 --> 00:15:02.382
So go back to my past church that I came.

00:15:02.952 --> 00:15:04.602
It was a church where I
gave my life to Christ.

00:15:04.632 --> 00:15:07.380
And the first year that we were
there, I sat under the gospel.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.700
I, I didn't give my life to Christ.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.230
But in that first year, we had
a young child, my daughter, and,

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.468
every single time we brought her
to the nursery, she would cry.

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:16.848
Anybody ever had that example?

00:15:16.908 --> 00:15:19.548
I mean, everybody maybe here at
ic, you've had that happen before.

00:15:19.908 --> 00:15:22.488
Every single time you bring your
kid to the nursery, they, they cry.

00:15:22.728 --> 00:15:24.468
And here's what the nursery
workers would tell us.

00:15:25.908 --> 00:15:29.388
Just leave her here for 10 minutes and if
she doesn't stop crying, we'll call you.

00:15:29.478 --> 00:15:30.438
And it seemed like every.

00:15:31.683 --> 00:15:34.203
, Peyton, our oldest daughter, would stay
in a little bit longer and a little bit

00:15:34.203 --> 00:15:37.083
longer, and all of a sudden Peyton was
staying there the whole time and she

00:15:37.083 --> 00:15:39.963
wasn't crying and she actually loved
it to the point where she didn't ever

00:15:39.968 --> 00:15:41.703
want to leave children's ministry.

00:15:42.213 --> 00:15:45.643
Well, in that year, of her going in there,
me and Brittany were able to send her to

00:15:45.643 --> 00:15:49.333
the gospel for multiple weeks, multiple
weeks over and over and over again, and

00:15:49.363 --> 00:15:50.953
eventually I gave my life to Christ.

00:15:51.553 --> 00:15:56.233
And I started thinking this
week about how important nursery

00:15:56.233 --> 00:15:58.043
workers' roles were in my s.

00:15:58.498 --> 00:16:01.848
And I started thinking about
this, what they don't know, and,

00:16:01.853 --> 00:16:02.998
and I never communicated to them.

00:16:02.998 --> 00:16:05.818
And so I sent a text message to the
children's director there this week.

00:16:06.268 --> 00:16:11.848
What they didn't know is because they
served and, and took a crying baby

00:16:11.878 --> 00:16:14.548
and held her for 10 minutes and then
called us and then 15 and then 20.

00:16:14.548 --> 00:16:15.658
And all of a sudden she loved it.

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:20.038
That because they served, I was
able to give my life to Christ.

00:16:21.178 --> 00:16:25.768
To me, that is so impactful and
I speak about children's ministry

00:16:25.773 --> 00:16:27.778
because it seems like we, it
seems like children's ministry.

00:16:28.723 --> 00:16:30.883
, most of y'all tend to work
in there every other week.

00:16:30.883 --> 00:16:32.983
It seems like you're making a difference.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.730
not only in the lives of the parents
that get to sit in here to be able

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.670
to, to hear the gospel, but you're
making a difference in the kids' lives

00:16:38.675 --> 00:16:42.968
because under that ministry, two of our
four kids gave their lives to Christ.

00:16:43.538 --> 00:16:46.898
And so I think how critical, and I'm not
just children, my children's ministry,

00:16:46.898 --> 00:16:50.888
it's every ministry, but serving can lead
to somebody giving their lives to Christ.

00:16:50.888 --> 00:16:54.068
And sometimes we don't see that
impact because we're serving and

00:16:54.073 --> 00:16:55.838
we walk away and we may never know.

00:16:56.543 --> 00:16:59.123
This side of eternity, the
lives that we've impacted.

00:16:59.723 --> 00:17:03.203
But one day I texted the children's
director this, this week, I said,

00:17:03.203 --> 00:17:06.503
one day when you get to heaven,
you're gonna be able to lay the

00:17:06.503 --> 00:17:11.243
crown of my salvation at the Lord's
feet because of what you've done.

00:17:12.143 --> 00:17:15.983
And I wanted her to know that impact,
because I know that children's

00:17:15.988 --> 00:17:17.513
director is rarely in service.

00:17:17.513 --> 00:17:20.333
I know that children's director is
constantly getting text messages on Sunday

00:17:20.333 --> 00:17:23.273
morning about people that can't work, and
she's constantly filling those roles and

00:17:23.273 --> 00:17:25.523
she fills that pressure and she needed.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.670
how important that was.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.980
And so I wanted to just kind of
draw you guys in on the importance

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.780
of serving and why we serve.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.420
And so I'm thankful for them.

00:17:33.425 --> 00:17:36.330
And so let's kind of walk
through this text and see and

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.500
summarize this and get to this.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.120
Let's get through this
first part here, here.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.524
So versus 23, 24, basically this is the
disciples, kind of getting sidetracked.

00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:46.309
With who was Jesus' favorite.

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:49.789
If you kind of have watched, if you've
ever walked the gospels and read them,

00:17:50.179 --> 00:17:54.049
you see the disciples kind of trying to be
like, number one, number two with Jesus,

00:17:54.049 --> 00:17:58.039
like buddy, buddy and, and, and wanting
to kind of be the, the elite in there.

00:17:58.039 --> 00:18:01.819
And this is just another example and
we see here in the beginning right now

00:18:01.824 --> 00:18:06.859
is the, these two sons, right, John
and James known as the Sons of Thunder.

00:18:06.862 --> 00:18:08.099
and they were one.

00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:13.319
Jesus, two closest three followers
that he had, and they were wanting to

00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:19.679
be a part of, not just Jesus, two or
three on Earth, but in, in in heaven.

00:18:19.709 --> 00:18:21.269
He, they wanted to be at
the right and the left.

00:18:21.274 --> 00:18:24.089
And so what I believe, and I'm
looking at this, is they try to

00:18:24.089 --> 00:18:28.619
convince their mom, mom, if you go
tell Jesus, Jesus will listen to you

00:18:28.679 --> 00:18:29.909
because he'll listen to his mother.

00:18:30.329 --> 00:18:33.359
And I'm guessing that's probably
why she went and told Jesus, Hey,

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:36.089
will they be able to sit at your
right and your left in the kingdom?

00:18:36.419 --> 00:18:37.949
And he responds, that's up to God.

00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:38.909
That's not up to him.

00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:43.709
And so we see in verse 24 where
his, the other disciples heard what

00:18:43.709 --> 00:18:45.209
was trying to happen here, right?

00:18:45.239 --> 00:18:48.179
They were trying to get a leg up on the
other 10 disciples and it said that they

00:18:48.179 --> 00:18:49.769
were indignant or they were frustrated.

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:50.519
They were mad.

00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:54.389
They were jealous of
James and John for asking.

00:18:55.499 --> 00:18:59.069
. And so the reason why is because they
wanted to have those seats, right?

00:18:59.069 --> 00:19:02.309
So when we look at this, and this
is something I want us to not miss

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:05.579
here, these disciples, if we're
looking at Matthew chapter 20,

00:19:05.969 --> 00:19:08.069
there's not a ton of chapters left.

00:19:08.159 --> 00:19:11.789
There's a lot that's already happened
up to this point at the back end of

00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:16.469
Jesus' life, the people that were
following Jesus the closest, were

00:19:16.469 --> 00:19:20.549
more focused on their physician in
heaven than building God's kingdom.

00:19:20.609 --> 00:19:21.089
I wanna say that.

00:19:21.914 --> 00:19:25.934
The people that were closest to Jesus
when Jesus was about to die on the cross

00:19:26.564 --> 00:19:32.354
were more worried about their position
in heaven than building God's kingdom.

00:19:33.014 --> 00:19:35.324
Do you guys feel like you
can relate at times May?

00:19:35.324 --> 00:19:36.074
That was just me.

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:39.194
I'm sitting here and I, and, and the
first thing I want to do in the Bible

00:19:39.199 --> 00:19:40.844
whenever I read it, is to judge people.

00:19:41.114 --> 00:19:43.904
Does anybody, does anybody
else read the Bible and judge?

00:19:45.509 --> 00:19:45.869
Please.

00:19:45.869 --> 00:19:46.229
Thank you.

00:19:46.229 --> 00:19:47.519
I'm glad I'm not the only one.

00:19:47.639 --> 00:19:50.339
I mean, I've been reading the book
of judges lately, and if you've been

00:19:50.339 --> 00:19:51.959
reading the book of judges, that's all.

00:19:52.139 --> 00:19:54.659
All you go is are they
ever gonna get this right?

00:19:55.199 --> 00:19:58.409
Because it's like, oh, I, you know,
they forget the Lord and they begin to

00:19:58.414 --> 00:20:02.249
serve all these other gods, and then
all these bad things happen to them

00:20:02.249 --> 00:20:05.159
and then they repent and it's like,
oh, things are great for 40 years.

00:20:05.159 --> 00:20:07.259
And then it happens over again
and it happens over again.

00:20:07.379 --> 00:20:09.209
And I just wanna be like, come on guys.

00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:12.779
And then I wake up one morning and I
look in the mirror and I say, come on.

00:20:13.889 --> 00:20:15.299
because it seems like that's me too.

00:20:15.959 --> 00:20:18.749
And so I can kind of relate with
these guys where I get so focused

00:20:18.749 --> 00:20:22.889
on my position in heaven and I
forget about building God's kingdom.

00:20:23.249 --> 00:20:24.689
And so I just, I think about this, right?

00:20:24.689 --> 00:20:26.699
We end up worrying more
about ourselves, right?

00:20:26.704 --> 00:20:28.409
Our comforts are needs.

00:20:28.679 --> 00:20:30.659
For some of you, I know this
isn't true, but sometimes this

00:20:30.659 --> 00:20:34.408
happens in church, your seat in
the church more than anything else.

00:20:34.408 --> 00:20:36.751
and I think at times sometimes
we get distracted with wanting

00:20:36.751 --> 00:20:40.951
to be in the service more than
we want to be able to serve as.

00:20:41.626 --> 00:20:44.356
And so we worry more about our
position with Christ, right?

00:20:44.356 --> 00:20:48.256
Our inward focus during the week, or even
at church, that we miss opportunities

00:20:48.256 --> 00:20:52.306
to engage someone with the gospel or
invite them to church, or even talk to

00:20:52.306 --> 00:20:54.376
a guest during our five minute break.

00:20:55.006 --> 00:20:56.176
You, you all know this, right?

00:20:56.176 --> 00:20:59.116
Is we had this five minute break to
be able to connect with people and

00:20:59.116 --> 00:21:00.886
sometimes we're more focused on ourselves.

00:21:00.886 --> 00:21:03.886
And this isn't, guys, I'm just,
I'm just saying let's be real.

00:21:03.916 --> 00:21:08.056
Let's kind of think through, we all
sometimes get inward focused, right?

00:21:09.091 --> 00:21:10.861
And the good thing is, is
that we're in good company,

00:21:10.861 --> 00:21:12.031
cuz the disciples did it too.

00:21:12.391 --> 00:21:13.891
But Jesus didn't leave them there.

00:21:13.891 --> 00:21:17.071
And this is where we get to this
next part, right in verse 25.

00:21:17.071 --> 00:21:20.461
So he gathers them all together, he
says, he calls 'em over and he said

00:21:20.461 --> 00:21:24.541
them, you know that the rulers of the
Gentile Lord, them, Lord it over them.

00:21:24.541 --> 00:21:27.841
And those in high positions
act as tyrants over them.

00:21:28.711 --> 00:21:31.951
So when we look at this, basically
this is what Jesus is saying.

00:21:32.221 --> 00:21:36.991
Worldly leaders care more about
their position over people and treat

00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:38.041
people like they're better than.

00:21:39.346 --> 00:21:41.056
and I even kind of went
a little bit further.

00:21:41.326 --> 00:21:46.036
These religious leaders, these worldly
leaders cared more about serving and

00:21:46.036 --> 00:21:50.356
securing their position as leaders
than the people that they were serving.

00:21:51.706 --> 00:21:54.616
Sounds like our politics today, and that's
probably the most political thing I'll

00:21:54.621 --> 00:21:59.176
ever say up here, but I think at times
our leaders in the world tend to think

00:21:59.176 --> 00:22:03.496
more about their position being secured
and their wants that meet their needs

00:22:03.496 --> 00:22:06.436
rather than the people that they're.

00:22:07.471 --> 00:22:09.601
again, why am I saying that?

00:22:09.606 --> 00:22:12.871
Because he's speaking about
worldly leaders who were

00:22:12.871 --> 00:22:14.521
lording it over Gentiles, right?

00:22:14.581 --> 00:22:21.451
So let's look then at verse 26, he says
this, it must not be like this among you.

00:22:22.201 --> 00:22:23.191
So now let's look at this.

00:22:23.196 --> 00:22:27.211
Is he talking to the disciples because
they're leaders or because they're

00:22:27.211 --> 00:22:28.921
people who have the gospel message?

00:22:29.671 --> 00:22:31.741
I believe it's because these
are people who have the gospel

00:22:31.741 --> 00:22:32.641
message, which is something.

00:22:33.931 --> 00:22:36.961
Something that people who
have the gospel message could

00:22:36.961 --> 00:22:38.371
Lord it over people who don't.

00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:42.571
They could begin to think that they're
better and they could begin to serve

00:22:42.571 --> 00:22:46.801
themselves more than the people who
God has called them to go serve.

00:22:47.701 --> 00:22:48.001
Right?

00:22:48.006 --> 00:22:51.481
So Jesus is saying that those that are
carrying the gospel message in and through

00:22:51.486 --> 00:22:54.031
your lives should not be selfish and self.

00:22:55.546 --> 00:22:58.906
, and then he says verse 26
at the back end of verse 26.

00:22:59.386 --> 00:23:00.916
It must not be like this among you.

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:05.386
Contrary on the contrary, whoever
wants to become great among you must

00:23:05.386 --> 00:23:10.516
be your servant, and whoever wants to
be first among you must be your slave.

00:23:11.226 --> 00:23:14.296
Well, that makes a little
bit of sense, right?

00:23:14.326 --> 00:23:17.536
What, what should we be worrying
about if we've been given the gospel

00:23:17.536 --> 00:23:21.256
message, not about how we can be
served, but how others can be served?

00:23:21.496 --> 00:23:23.206
And this is the moment that I.

00:23:24.406 --> 00:23:26.866
and I started thinking like,
a lot of us think, you ready?

00:23:28.006 --> 00:23:29.266
But what if I don't wanna be first?

00:23:31.456 --> 00:23:34.577
What, what if I don't, wanna be
the greatest among everybody?

00:23:35.717 --> 00:23:37.457
Do I still need to serve people?

00:23:38.237 --> 00:23:41.297
Because I'm telling you
guys, I, I, I do it.

00:23:41.297 --> 00:23:43.697
I read the Bible and I wanna find an out.

00:23:44.237 --> 00:23:47.957
I wanna find a way that the Lord
isn't gonna call me to step.

00:23:48.587 --> 00:23:50.327
And do something that's difficult.

00:23:50.537 --> 00:23:52.277
I want to find a way
to say, you know what?

00:23:52.277 --> 00:23:53.477
I don't need to do that.

00:23:53.897 --> 00:23:55.547
Oh, that's only for special people.

00:23:55.547 --> 00:23:57.887
That's only for this group of
people and this group of people.

00:23:58.157 --> 00:24:02.417
And, and when I looked at this, I couldn't
hide from him because he's not just

00:24:02.417 --> 00:24:05.897
talking to leaders, he's talking to people
who have been given the gospel message.

00:24:05.897 --> 00:24:09.947
And it's not about being first,
it's really about someone

00:24:09.947 --> 00:24:10.967
who has given their lives to.

00:24:11.822 --> 00:24:14.192
And so here's what I
have to say about that.

00:24:14.252 --> 00:24:19.352
When it comes to the idea of being
first or to to be great, number one,

00:24:19.622 --> 00:24:23.822
if you're saying I'm just a normal
Christian, God has never saved a normal

00:24:23.822 --> 00:24:25.562
Christian, I'm gonna say that again.

00:24:25.562 --> 00:24:27.062
God has never saved a normal Christian.

00:24:27.692 --> 00:24:34.982
We are special, we are gifted, and we
are sent by God as called out Christians.

00:24:35.192 --> 00:24:36.932
So if we want to say,
well, I don't wanna be.

00:24:39.182 --> 00:24:42.512
That's not an option in the fact
of saying meaning like the idea

00:24:42.512 --> 00:24:44.942
behind taking a seat in the back.

00:24:44.942 --> 00:24:45.302
Right.

00:24:45.752 --> 00:24:50.492
He has challenged us to go out
and to be the ones that lead the

00:24:50.492 --> 00:24:55.097
example of who Jesus is, not to
serve our purposes, but to serve.

00:24:55.892 --> 00:24:58.112
not only his, but other people.

00:24:58.442 --> 00:25:01.502
And, and really, here's even something
that kind of brings more light to this.

00:25:01.502 --> 00:25:05.252
In Jesus' example, towards the end
of his life, in John 13, verse 12

00:25:05.252 --> 00:25:09.212
through 17, it says this, when Jesus
had washed their feet, and this is

00:25:09.212 --> 00:25:13.022
them, the disciples or at the Lord's
supper, the, the last table, right?

00:25:13.022 --> 00:25:14.162
Their, the reclining.

00:25:14.162 --> 00:25:16.142
They're getting ready to
see Jesus be taken away.

00:25:16.202 --> 00:25:16.712
They don't know.

00:25:17.927 --> 00:25:22.337
And Jesus stops in the middle of their
dinner and he says this, when Jesus

00:25:22.337 --> 00:25:25.847
had washed their feet and put on their
clothing, he reclined again to them.

00:25:25.847 --> 00:25:27.707
And he says, do you know what I have done?

00:25:28.217 --> 00:25:33.677
You call me teacher and Lord, and you
speak rightly since that's what I am.

00:25:34.397 --> 00:25:39.527
So if I, your Lord and teacher have washed
her feet, you also ought to wash one

00:25:39.527 --> 00:25:44.297
another's feet for I have given you an
example that you should do as I have done.

00:25:45.392 --> 00:25:49.652
. Truly, I tell you, a servant is not
greater than his master, and a messenger

00:25:49.652 --> 00:25:51.692
is not greater than the one who sent him.

00:25:52.082 --> 00:25:55.532
If you know these things, you
are blessed if you do them.

00:25:56.552 --> 00:25:57.992
What is Jesus saying here?

00:25:58.412 --> 00:26:03.542
Jesus is the king of the
world, the Savior of the world.

00:26:04.052 --> 00:26:10.322
They viewed him as teacher and
Lord, and if he humbled himself to.

00:26:12.647 --> 00:26:19.487
How much more should those whom he
has saved follow his example, and this

00:26:19.487 --> 00:26:21.287
is really where verse 28 comes in.

00:26:21.407 --> 00:26:25.907
If you go back to Matthew 20, verse
28 says, just as the son man did not

00:26:25.907 --> 00:26:30.877
come to serve, to be served, but to
serve and to give us life as a ransom.

00:26:31.727 --> 00:26:36.407
I think it's interesting, and we've
studied this before as a church, the

00:26:36.407 --> 00:26:39.827
verses that I just read about that,
that last supper and, and him washing.

00:26:41.027 --> 00:26:45.377
, why would Jesus serve and show that
example right before his death?

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:52.757
Because it was such a critical piece for
us to understand the value of serving.

00:26:53.357 --> 00:26:59.407
When Jesus served, it transformed and
changed lives because he served us.

00:26:59.987 --> 00:27:03.617
We now have the ability to have
salvation, to be forgiven of our sins.

00:27:03.977 --> 00:27:04.937
That's an amazing picture.

00:27:05.852 --> 00:27:07.292
And then what did Jesus do?

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:09.392
He says, I now send you out.

00:27:09.397 --> 00:27:12.602
He says, go therefore and make
disciples of all nations, baptizing

00:27:12.602 --> 00:27:15.452
them in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit, right?

00:27:16.092 --> 00:27:17.912
Teaching them all these things.

00:27:18.722 --> 00:27:23.492
And, and I think about this in
this idea of Jesus served to

00:27:23.497 --> 00:27:28.682
model how we are supposed to serve
sacrificially for the sake of others.

00:27:31.022 --> 00:27:33.582
But I, I know what you're think.

00:27:34.382 --> 00:27:35.552
. I don't have time to serve.

00:27:36.092 --> 00:27:37.262
My life's busy.

00:27:38.252 --> 00:27:42.212
Well, I've learned this, that I
don't think I have a, I don't think

00:27:42.212 --> 00:27:43.592
I have an easier life than you.

00:27:43.592 --> 00:27:44.852
And you don't have an easier life than me.

00:27:44.852 --> 00:27:47.342
And I think every person
in the world is busy.

00:27:47.342 --> 00:27:48.842
It's what we're busy with.

00:27:49.292 --> 00:27:50.102
It's what we're busy with.

00:27:50.102 --> 00:27:53.852
And then I would say this, our heart and
our mind behind what we're busy with.

00:27:54.452 --> 00:27:57.242
Cuz I, I'm just telling you, I
have four kids and getting ready

00:27:57.242 --> 00:27:58.472
to be in four different activities.

00:27:58.472 --> 00:28:01.802
And if all I look at those are, I'm busy
and I don't have time to serve, I've.

00:28:02.732 --> 00:28:07.322
That all four of those activities are
ways to serve not only my family, but

00:28:07.322 --> 00:28:09.872
the kids that I'm gonna be coaching at
soccer and the families that are gonna

00:28:09.872 --> 00:28:13.592
be on the sidelines while my kids are out
there practicing and I'm not playing on

00:28:13.592 --> 00:28:15.062
my phone, but I'm gonna connect with them.

00:28:16.022 --> 00:28:18.782
You know, it's, it's the opportunity
where we look at with our coworkers

00:28:18.782 --> 00:28:21.542
and we know there are heads down and
we're working hard, but there's ways to

00:28:21.542 --> 00:28:26.732
serve them by I'm gonna buy them a meal
to, I'm gonna serve them by listening

00:28:26.732 --> 00:28:28.952
to the needs that they have in their
life and saying, Hey, can I come over

00:28:28.952 --> 00:28:30.092
on Saturday and help you mow your.

00:28:31.607 --> 00:28:32.867
you know, can I help you fix your mower?

00:28:32.867 --> 00:28:33.437
That's not me.

00:28:33.437 --> 00:28:34.457
I'll ask somebody else to do that.

00:28:34.462 --> 00:28:36.587
But that may be you, right?

00:28:36.587 --> 00:28:39.737
It, it's, it's coming with a
heart to serve and finding ways

00:28:39.737 --> 00:28:44.087
to serve if we'll just listen and
really pick up our eyes and see.

00:28:45.107 --> 00:28:47.717
So Jesus sets this standard to serve.

00:28:48.257 --> 00:28:51.287
So why do we as a church,
serve the way we sh we serve?

00:28:51.287 --> 00:28:54.977
Because it opens the doors
to share our faith, right?

00:28:55.577 --> 00:28:59.417
People came from everywhere when
Jesus was healing, which is a form of.

00:29:00.377 --> 00:29:02.867
People came from everywhere
to experience Jesus.

00:29:03.437 --> 00:29:07.877
So when we think about practically
sharing our faith, it's not about knowing

00:29:07.877 --> 00:29:09.317
the, the ro, what did we talk about?

00:29:09.317 --> 00:29:11.627
The Roman roads or the three
circles or the, all the different

00:29:11.627 --> 00:29:12.707
methods of sharing the gospel.

00:29:12.712 --> 00:29:15.137
If you know those, those are
great, you should learn them.

00:29:15.617 --> 00:29:20.057
But I think the greatest way to evangelize
is through our everyday lives, through

00:29:20.057 --> 00:29:24.257
following Jesus, by living in community
and by serving those around us where we.

00:29:24.917 --> 00:29:28.817
It is so valuable because we truly wanna
see people come to faith in Christ.

00:29:28.997 --> 00:29:30.227
That's why we do what we do.

00:29:30.227 --> 00:29:32.597
We don't do it to please God.

00:29:32.867 --> 00:29:36.677
And I wanna make sure I, I'm clear
as, as all get out, we do not do

00:29:36.677 --> 00:29:40.607
these things just because we're
trying to please a God who thinks.

00:29:40.697 --> 00:29:43.907
If you don't do all these things
right, then you're not gonna be saved.

00:29:43.907 --> 00:29:45.737
If you don't do all these things right,
I'm not gonna be pleased with you.

00:29:45.887 --> 00:29:46.067
No.

00:29:46.067 --> 00:29:51.797
We do these things out of the desire in
our heart for people to experience Jesus.

00:29:52.112 --> 00:29:58.002
To experience forgiveness, to
experience a love that is unimaginable.

00:29:58.472 --> 00:30:02.252
And if you truly have experienced that,
and if you've lost that, if you've missed

00:30:02.252 --> 00:30:04.652
that, then here is my encouragement.

00:30:04.832 --> 00:30:09.752
Today's a day where you drive back into
experiencing that love once again, so that

00:30:09.752 --> 00:30:15.332
that love drives you back outward to share
the love of Christ with other people.

00:30:15.602 --> 00:30:16.952
Cuz that's where it starts.

00:30:17.132 --> 00:30:18.452
If you have been serving.

00:30:19.037 --> 00:30:24.437
In this church or other people
with a heart that is not with joy.

00:30:25.487 --> 00:30:29.717
I challenge you today to ask the
Lord to help you find joy in serving.

00:30:30.617 --> 00:30:31.847
He, here's a beautiful thing.

00:30:31.847 --> 00:30:33.167
Me and Brittany talk
about this all the time.

00:30:33.437 --> 00:30:35.747
Whenever you plant a church,
you'll do anything to make sure

00:30:35.752 --> 00:30:36.887
that the church is successful.

00:30:37.187 --> 00:30:39.047
Britney hasn't been in this
service for four weeks, and you

00:30:39.047 --> 00:30:40.097
know what she tells me every week?

00:30:40.097 --> 00:30:41.957
I can't wait to go spend
some time with the kids.

00:30:42.167 --> 00:30:43.517
I love investing with the kids.

00:30:43.697 --> 00:30:45.017
They get to hear the gospel with the.

00:30:45.857 --> 00:30:46.997
Here's the great thing.

00:30:47.057 --> 00:30:50.357
My wife wants to be here in
service just as much as you guys I

00:30:50.357 --> 00:30:51.647
hope, want to be here in service.

00:30:51.887 --> 00:30:54.797
But she cares more about the
kingdom of God and that's not to

00:30:54.802 --> 00:30:57.077
just raise her up, cuz I know many
of you serve in many different

00:30:57.077 --> 00:30:58.817
ways, but I want to challenge you.

00:30:59.507 --> 00:31:01.367
Don't serve with the wrong heart.

00:31:02.267 --> 00:31:06.617
Know that you may be the one that is
serving so that somebody can hear the

00:31:06.617 --> 00:31:11.177
gospel and one day give their lives to
Christ and you're serving for a purpose.

00:31:11.267 --> 00:31:14.657
You may be the one that shares the gospel
with without one kid that finally get.

00:31:15.242 --> 00:31:16.892
That says, I want to know Jesus.

00:31:18.212 --> 00:31:21.062
You may be the one that leads
worship on Sunday, and you wonder if

00:31:21.062 --> 00:31:25.502
anybody cares what you're saying or
worshiping, but you may be the one

00:31:25.507 --> 00:31:26.792
that's leading them to the cross.

00:31:26.792 --> 00:31:30.272
The God who shows forgiveness and
grace and mercy for someone that

00:31:30.277 --> 00:31:33.242
can really experience forgiveness.

00:31:33.247 --> 00:31:37.142
I don't know what area you serve in on
Sundays, but you may need to know that

00:31:37.142 --> 00:31:41.672
what you're doing is making a difference
and your serving makes a differe.

00:31:42.092 --> 00:31:42.932
Don't give up.

00:31:43.292 --> 00:31:44.222
Don't back down.

00:31:44.252 --> 00:31:47.072
Don't let the enemy deceive you.

00:31:47.162 --> 00:31:50.252
I was just talking to Josh a little
bit about this is, I, I, I'm reminded

00:31:50.252 --> 00:31:56.702
this, the enemy has to be loud
in order to get you distracted.

00:31:57.032 --> 00:32:00.002
So when you're distracted,
it's the enemy being loud.

00:32:00.007 --> 00:32:01.742
But I'll just tell you
this, the Lord whispers.

00:32:02.732 --> 00:32:04.262
Well, you wanna know
why the Lord whispers?

00:32:05.282 --> 00:32:06.302
Because we have to lean in.

00:32:07.682 --> 00:32:14.612
, we have to lean in and the, when we
lean in, we experience Jesus, but the

00:32:14.612 --> 00:32:16.802
enemy has to scream over his whisper.

00:32:17.552 --> 00:32:20.102
And I say all this to
say, guys, don't give up.

00:32:21.032 --> 00:32:22.202
Don't stop serving.

00:32:22.412 --> 00:32:26.192
Don't start doing or stop doing
what you, but you have been doing.

00:32:26.192 --> 00:32:30.602
But then those who maybe haven't
been able to, to see the fruit of,

00:32:30.632 --> 00:32:32.372
of, of scenes people come to Christ.

00:32:32.402 --> 00:32:33.062
What can you do?

00:32:33.062 --> 00:32:33.242
You.

00:32:33.842 --> 00:32:36.928
Of, so I wanna just give you some
examples, in our church where we've

00:32:36.928 --> 00:32:39.118
seen life change through serving,
and then we're gonna take some

00:32:39.118 --> 00:32:40.558
time to, to have an invitation.

00:32:40.978 --> 00:32:44.548
But as a church, we
prioritize serving others.

00:32:44.548 --> 00:32:48.508
If you haven't been a part of our
church for a long time, you may not know

00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:52.018
this, but you guys that have been for a
while, you know, we prioritize serving.

00:32:52.078 --> 00:32:53.488
Why do we do this?

00:32:53.878 --> 00:32:55.288
Because we've seen live change.

00:32:55.288 --> 00:32:57.508
I actually got a chance to reach
out to a couple of families

00:32:57.508 --> 00:32:59.300
this week, week and ask this.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:05.690
hey, are you at this church because you
had saw us serving and the answer was yes.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:07.254
and it's actually Riverview Elementary.

00:33:07.254 --> 00:33:10.734
We had served there multiple times,
not with the making sure that we

00:33:10.734 --> 00:33:12.634
got Josh and Christie here or Emily.

00:33:13.584 --> 00:33:15.714
It's not reason why we served,
just to make sure we got you here.

00:33:15.719 --> 00:33:19.734
We served because we wanted to
just show love and that may be the

00:33:19.734 --> 00:33:20.754
initial reason why they got here.

00:33:20.754 --> 00:33:24.234
But what I loved is actually getting
some response back as the reason

00:33:24.234 --> 00:33:26.214
why they're still here is because
of a lot of other reasons the.

00:33:27.714 --> 00:33:31.322
The, the words being preached,
the love of of the people, right?

00:33:31.322 --> 00:33:32.492
There's more things to this.

00:33:32.492 --> 00:33:36.782
But serving opened the door for us
to get in and connect with people.

00:33:37.442 --> 00:33:41.953
But this past week, we got to serve our
community at, the gym that I coach at.

00:33:42.463 --> 00:33:44.743
We weren't planning to go there,
but we needed a project to do

00:33:44.748 --> 00:33:45.943
because it was cold outside.

00:33:46.123 --> 00:33:48.913
And I said, Hey, can we go
clean the gym that I coach at?

00:33:48.913 --> 00:33:49.693
And she's like, sure.

00:33:49.693 --> 00:33:52.003
So we went in and cleaned no expectations.

00:33:52.003 --> 00:33:54.163
I didn't send her pictures
to say, Hey, give us credit.

00:33:54.913 --> 00:33:58.033
She reached back out and said, Hey, I
was talking to my classes tonight that

00:33:58.033 --> 00:34:00.973
I was coaching, and I was telling 'em
what your church did and none of 'em

00:34:00.973 --> 00:34:02.263
really knew much about your church.

00:34:02.383 --> 00:34:04.903
Can you send me all your church's
information and we'll share that

00:34:04.903 --> 00:34:06.793
with our whole gym community?

00:34:06.883 --> 00:34:07.783
I'm like, sure.

00:34:08.143 --> 00:34:08.923
So I sent that to him.

00:34:09.133 --> 00:34:11.923
That wasn't my goal, but God
opened the door for people to

00:34:11.923 --> 00:34:13.063
hear more about inspiring hope.

00:34:13.603 --> 00:34:17.518
The things we've done here at the Y M C A,
we just cleaned out the whole, preschool

00:34:17.788 --> 00:34:20.712
or playground and it looks amazing and
our kids will get to experience it.

00:34:20.712 --> 00:34:23.532
But a summer program for the Y M C A is
gonna get to experience that playground

00:34:23.682 --> 00:34:25.032
cuz it hasn't been used in two years.

00:34:25.242 --> 00:34:29.082
And you know what I've been
hearing why staff members and

00:34:29.082 --> 00:34:31.002
why members asking, who did this?

00:34:31.032 --> 00:34:32.152
Why are you doing this?

00:34:32.412 --> 00:34:35.112
We serve because Jesus served.

00:34:35.622 --> 00:34:40.002
Jesus came to serve so that other
people could experience hope.

00:34:40.877 --> 00:34:41.367
Amen.

00:34:41.372 --> 00:34:44.967
We as a church, will prioritize
serving because we want other

00:34:44.972 --> 00:34:46.647
people to experience hope in Jesus.

00:34:46.647 --> 00:34:50.067
And there's more and more stories of
things that we've done, and we brought

00:34:50.067 --> 00:34:51.477
gifts to teachers again this week.

00:34:51.477 --> 00:34:54.837
And I'm, I'm hoping that we continue to
do that because we want them to know that

00:34:54.837 --> 00:34:58.887
we love them first and foremost, that
we love them and that Jesus loves them.

00:34:59.277 --> 00:35:03.627
And we believe that God will, God
has opened doors and one, one of the

00:35:03.627 --> 00:35:07.077
coolest things, and I'm gonna stop and,
and we're gonna move on even though.

00:35:08.397 --> 00:35:10.497
It wasn't the reason why they were there.

00:35:11.127 --> 00:35:14.010
Lauren and Brian showed up, took
a project that we did, Easter

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.450
egg hunt out in the park, right?

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:16.590
Was it Easter Egg hunt or something?

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:17.070
Halloween.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:17.760
Halloween.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.510
I don't remember what it was.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:18.750
Okay.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:19.200
Halloween.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.560
There we go.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.340
I can't remember what it was.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:23.094
Halloween and they showed up
and there was five people.

00:35:23.334 --> 00:35:27.834
Now you showed up because of an invite,
but you guys made the statement that

00:35:27.834 --> 00:35:31.164
you felt more comfortable after you
built relationships with people cause

00:35:31.164 --> 00:35:33.744
they connected with you to be able
to come to church that next week

00:35:34.044 --> 00:35:35.664
because of the event and willingness.

00:35:36.414 --> 00:35:41.124
And I, I go back to that day and I
remember that day being so mad, so

00:35:41.124 --> 00:35:45.444
mad, and I was like bound to determine
we were gonna have that event.

00:35:45.444 --> 00:35:47.214
So we just didn't cancel
it even though it rained.

00:35:47.754 --> 00:35:51.714
And I'm so glad we didn't because we have
Lauren and Brian and their family and,

00:35:51.714 --> 00:35:56.604
and I look at this and saying like, we
serve because we know God will open doors.

00:35:56.784 --> 00:36:01.134
So does serving allow
us to share the gospel?

00:36:01.134 --> 00:36:02.274
We've seen it in our church.

00:36:02.694 --> 00:36:04.124
Does living in c.

00:36:04.869 --> 00:36:06.969
allow people to hear
the gospel and respond.

00:36:06.969 --> 00:36:07.569
Absolutely.

00:36:07.569 --> 00:36:08.859
We've seen fruit from it.

00:36:09.039 --> 00:36:11.739
Joe and Kristen aren't here, but
whenever they got to be a part of,

00:36:11.799 --> 00:36:14.229
well, Kristen's serving whenever they
got to be a part of our inspire group

00:36:14.229 --> 00:36:18.009
for a while, I believe that helped them
feel closer to our community and one

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.239
day they gave their lives to Christ.

00:36:19.239 --> 00:36:22.329
Soon after that, I think about
just following Jesus, and I've

00:36:22.329 --> 00:36:25.509
seen many of you as you've Jesus,
that you've got the opportunity to

00:36:25.509 --> 00:36:26.769
share your faith with other people.

00:36:27.129 --> 00:36:27.579
Guys.

00:36:28.059 --> 00:36:31.509
That to me is evangelism it.

00:36:31.509 --> 00:36:33.699
It is not knowing all the right things.

00:36:34.209 --> 00:36:37.659
Although it's good to know more
things, it's not about having every

00:36:37.659 --> 00:36:41.379
single evangelism track memorized,
although those things are good.

00:36:42.459 --> 00:36:48.429
It's about literally just being yourself
and following Jesus and experiencing

00:36:48.429 --> 00:36:51.009
that love and then living it out.

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:52.239
And we will.

00:36:52.269 --> 00:36:55.089
And we have seen people
get their lives to Christ.

00:36:55.809 --> 00:37:01.914
And so my challenge to you as we take
some time, dare an invitation, is, Number

00:37:01.914 --> 00:37:05.604
one, I think you need to ask yourself
this question, and I think this is why I

00:37:05.604 --> 00:37:07.404
feel like I brought this up earlier on.

00:37:07.944 --> 00:37:15.114
If Jesus has changed your life, if you
can say yes to that, then your response

00:37:15.594 --> 00:37:18.654
is that God has called you and equipped
you to share your faith with others

00:37:18.834 --> 00:37:21.504
through following Jesus, living in
community and serving those around you.

00:37:21.654 --> 00:37:24.744
It's plain and simple and, and
you don't need to miss that

00:37:24.744 --> 00:37:26.634
if Jesus has changed your.

00:37:27.939 --> 00:37:32.649
There's no reason why that God will
not use you through those three things.

00:37:34.239 --> 00:37:36.279
He desires to use you.

00:37:36.279 --> 00:37:39.819
He has called you to go be
the light of Christ to those

00:37:39.819 --> 00:37:41.529
around you through those ways.

00:37:41.919 --> 00:37:45.369
Number two, if you haven't given
your life to Christ, if you haven't

00:37:45.374 --> 00:37:49.779
experienced a life change with
Jesus, that's where it starts.

00:37:49.989 --> 00:37:51.819
Cuz I'll tell you this, I've been there.

00:37:52.719 --> 00:37:55.209
I've been there in that other other
place where I didn't know Jesus

00:37:55.209 --> 00:37:56.649
and I tried just doing the right.

00:37:57.099 --> 00:37:59.169
And I'll just tell you,
you'll never do enough.

00:38:00.129 --> 00:38:01.509
It'll never satisfy you.

00:38:01.899 --> 00:38:03.069
It, it's not gonna work.

00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:05.799
You can go out there and try to do all
these great things and serve people and

00:38:05.799 --> 00:38:07.419
do great things, but it'll never work.

00:38:07.599 --> 00:38:08.859
You need to come to Jesus.

00:38:09.699 --> 00:38:12.489
And so if you need to give your life to
Jesus today, that is my challenge to you.

00:38:13.209 --> 00:38:14.319
Don't wait.

00:38:14.919 --> 00:38:15.609
Don't wait.

00:38:16.599 --> 00:38:17.229
Don't wait.

00:38:18.339 --> 00:38:22.539
On a Sunday night, almost 12 years
ago, I was sitting in a room full of

00:38:22.539 --> 00:38:24.339
12 people in an auditorium of about.

00:38:24.804 --> 00:38:28.104
Or 12 people because that's Sunday
Night Church back about 12 years ago.

00:38:28.974 --> 00:38:31.824
And the pastor challenged me,
he challenged everybody there.

00:38:32.364 --> 00:38:36.204
If you haven't given your life to
Jesus, today is the day of salvation.

00:38:37.854 --> 00:38:43.164
And I'm so thankful that I got out
of the way and I raised my hand and I

00:38:43.164 --> 00:38:45.024
said I needed to give my life to Jesus.

00:38:45.144 --> 00:38:50.274
And that day transformed my life because
I began to take steps closer to knowing

00:38:50.274 --> 00:38:53.924
who Jesus was, cuz I didn't know it all,
but I knew enough that I needed to be.

00:38:55.359 --> 00:38:56.439
And so here's the thing.

00:38:56.709 --> 00:39:00.459
There's days that we do things
differently, but today is a day where

00:39:00.459 --> 00:39:01.869
I want to challenge you with this.

00:39:02.559 --> 00:39:07.269
If you have not given your life to Christ
and you desire to, today, I'm gonna

00:39:07.274 --> 00:39:09.549
challenge you boldly to raise your hand.

00:39:10.449 --> 00:39:13.389
And in this room, we're all
looking around in this room.

00:39:13.389 --> 00:39:16.029
If you raise your hand, nobody's
gonna stare and point and laugh.

00:39:16.029 --> 00:39:16.899
You know what they're gonna do?

00:39:16.959 --> 00:39:17.949
They're gonna praise God.

00:39:19.269 --> 00:39:21.579
So my challenge today, if there's
someone in this room that needs to give

00:39:21.579 --> 00:39:23.329
life to Christ, that you would raise.

00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:25.329
That you would say you need Jesus.

00:39:25.509 --> 00:39:28.389
And here's the cool part, that as
a church, we will pray together

00:39:29.139 --> 00:39:32.619
and we will walk alongside you and
we'll encourage you in your faith.

00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:35.319
And we will not let
you do this life alone.

00:39:35.319 --> 00:39:40.299
We will be the light of Jesus
because God has transformed our life.

00:39:41.019 --> 00:39:43.239
So I challenge you right
now in this moment.

00:39:43.479 --> 00:39:45.429
If you wanna give your life to
Jesus, just raise your hand.

00:39:45.879 --> 00:39:46.509
Just raise your hand.

00:39:46.509 --> 00:39:48.009
Now if there's anybody in this room.

00:39:48.789 --> 00:39:50.919
If not, hey, that's fine.

00:39:51.429 --> 00:39:52.629
But my challenge is always.

00:39:53.379 --> 00:39:57.369
For you to be bold before the Lord, okay?

00:39:58.269 --> 00:40:03.159
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pray
for us, but if you're holding back,

00:40:03.519 --> 00:40:07.299
not raising your hand, but you wanna
have a conversation about who Jesus

00:40:07.299 --> 00:40:11.679
is, don't leave today before you
come talk to me or someone else.

00:40:11.949 --> 00:40:17.169
Don't leave today before you
get a chance to experience a

00:40:17.549 --> 00:40:18.819
personal relationship with Jesus.

00:40:18.879 --> 00:40:19.419
So let's pray.

00:40:19.419 --> 00:40:20.619
Lord Jesus, we love you.

00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:21.669
God.

00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:22.269
We are so thank.

00:40:23.274 --> 00:40:29.094
That your word reminds us how important
serving is, Lord, that your word

00:40:29.094 --> 00:40:33.924
reminds us that when we serve other
people, get the opportunity to hear

00:40:33.929 --> 00:40:36.384
the gospel and give their lives to you.

00:40:37.374 --> 00:40:41.994
God, this whole evangelism series is not
about just another series and another

00:40:41.999 --> 00:40:45.714
opportunity to push something else, Lord,
but it's just a reminder of what we've

00:40:45.714 --> 00:40:46.914
been given through our relationship.

00:40:47.709 --> 00:40:51.609
That you have so transformed our lives,
Lord, that there are people around us

00:40:51.669 --> 00:40:56.199
that need to be transformed with that same
love, grace and mercy that you have given.

00:40:57.519 --> 00:41:01.869
So God, I pray that you challenge each
person in this room, Lord, that has given

00:41:01.869 --> 00:41:06.309
their lives to you, that they begin to
not feel the pressure to do these things,

00:41:06.579 --> 00:41:10.389
but Lord, they feel the love and the
desire of the outflow relationship with

00:41:10.389 --> 00:41:14.739
you to follow you closer so that other
people can experience relationship.

00:41:15.879 --> 00:41:20.769
To live in communities so that they
can be encouraged and sent out to share

00:41:20.769 --> 00:41:27.759
their faith, and that they can begin to
prioritize serving those around them so

00:41:27.764 --> 00:41:29.469
that people will come to faith in you.

00:41:30.819 --> 00:41:35.529
But God, I know in a room this big that
there's someone in this room that may

00:41:35.789 --> 00:41:38.049
be struggling with their salvation,
whether they've given their lives.

00:41:39.144 --> 00:41:41.514
And if that's their next step, Lord,
and I'm praying that you give them

00:41:41.514 --> 00:41:43.194
the boldness, Lord, to stand up.

00:41:43.194 --> 00:41:46.284
During this time, during music, Lord,
they come back to the back and they

00:41:46.284 --> 00:41:49.614
come back and they have a conversation
about how it is to follow you.

00:41:49.984 --> 00:41:50.964
God, give them faith.

00:41:51.714 --> 00:41:52.404
Give them faith.

00:41:53.904 --> 00:41:57.504
Give us all faith, Lord to go out and
fulfill the calling that you've called

00:41:57.504 --> 00:41:59.934
us to be sharing our faith this week.

00:42:00.714 --> 00:42:02.034
Lord, we just pray this
in your heaven name.

00:42:03.294 --> 00:42:03.624
Amen.

00:42:03.924 --> 00:42:04.164
Amen.
