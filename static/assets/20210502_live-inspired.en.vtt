00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
lines exactly with what we are calling um 
our church to do is to go live inspired and  

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.760
it's really cool when it lines up like that 
so no every week i'm not able to like twist  

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.200
the words right i'm not into twisting words i'm 
really just taking the text and uh really just  

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.760
declaring truth that god has reminded us of our 
church but anyways um so we'll be walking through  

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.560
that so today we're gonna be in ephesians chapter 
five um and we're gonna start with verse eight so  

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.320
we've been walking through a lot of things and 
again if uh if you don't have a bible i'm just  

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.440
gonna i say this every week and i'll remind you 
every week if you don't have a bible there's two  

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.560
two ways to get one number one back here on our 
table in our next steps table there's a bible  

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.280
it's yours for free um take one it's yours 
number two um the greatest way to take time  

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.360
with you everywhere you go and not forget it 
because we know we don't forget our phones is  

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.040
to download it and so i use the holy bible app um 
why do i encourage that is because i use it and i  

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.360
see a lot of people use it so get on there follow 
some plans and walk you through how to study the  

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.800
bible it's one of my favorite apps i'll tell you 
this i started reading the bible ten times more  

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.440
when i downloaded the bible that's why 
it's there so here's just an encouragement  

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.440
um it'd be worth it so um we have been walking 
through a couple of things but i wanted to start  

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.240
this way i'm just going to highlight a little 
bit about what we're going to talk about is  

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.360
has anybody noticed how important white is i 
mean that may sound like a stupid statement how  

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.800
important life is so when we walk in here on 
sunday mornings there's two emergency lights on  

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.080
which i'll run right now because we'll pull them 
up but anyways there's two emergency lights on  

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.360
but if they're not on we're walking straight 
into darkness and so we aren't able to see so  

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.360
life is obviously important in your life that 
makes logical sense but it's very important but  

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.840
anybody in here ever lost power at night before 
you went to bed we're not talking about the whole  

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.200
you know home alone one out of nine that my 
alarm didn't get reset and now i woke up late  

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.800
but what i promise when it's at night 
like when you're usually watching tv  

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.200
and it's 100 degrees outside because it's summer  

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.160
and there's no air conditioning right you got 
anybody ever lost power during those times i i  

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
know i did as a kid uh more times than i would 
like to think as we live down the country and  

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.840
when you lost power they pretty much forgot about 
you until monday but what i found with that was  

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.280
we were always searching for like the moment the 
lights went out we were searching for light so my  

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.000
mom wouldn't grab the candle because we didn't 
have phones that could light up anything right  

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.680
but for us when clients go out we grab our phones 
we grab a flashlight and grab a candle because the  

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.400
light is important to us and it's so important 
to us and it's so ingrained in our minds that  

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.080
everybody knows this is the first thing you 
do when you wake up and you go into a room  

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.640
you flip on a mine so again have you ever been in 
that room where it's dark and all the lights are  

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.000
out because the electric's out and you go into a 
room even though you know the electrics out and  

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.600
you flip the switch right it's so driven into 
us that it's important for light so i'm saying  

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.600
that to say as you walk through this text today 
i want you to understand the importance of light  

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.120
and how light basically dissipates darkness 
because darkness is not what we like being  

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.480
and we like being in light and that's what god's 
called us to be so um we're going to be talking  

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.960
again just the importance of walking in light how 
we should look inspired today by shining the light  

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.520
of christ of those around us but just to kind of 
catch you up on where we have been and i'm going  

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.280
to take a brief moment to do that and then then i 
think it will be great for you to be able to hear  

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.680
from somebody what that means and so we've been 
walking through the book of ephesians for the last  

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.960
several months i don't know how long uh probably 
since about january um but we have been walking  

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.200
through these chapters now we're in chapter five 
and so for those of you who weren't here in this  

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.760
first couple of chapters it's so important for you 
to know these chapters and so ephesians 1 2 and  

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.720
3 talk about what christ or what god has done for 
you right what christ or what god has done for you  

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.160
in order for you to experience a relationship with 
him in order for you to experience salvation in  

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.520
order to spend eternity with him and to live with 
hope and so he he talked about all these things  

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.240
that he has done for you and then he changes in 
chapters four five and six and he says now walk  

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.080
live because of what i've done for you and 
so i thought one of the greatest ways for  

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.680
us to even kind of get an idea of what 
that looks like what god has done for us  

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.240
and why we walk in light or while we walk as 
god is called to walk is to hear a testimony  

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.840
of somebody who talks about what god has done 
for them and how they are living because of  

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.200
that hope and if you're wondering have i chose 
somebody and i'm going to point you out in the  

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.120
room no i'm not going to put each other 
and trust me it's my wife she already  

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.200
is very prepared and planned so she's going to 
take a couple minutes to kind of share her story  

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.160
about what guy's done for um what god's laid in 
her heart and then also the reason why she walks

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.520
i don't know how prepared he's saying but 
honestly i forgot that he asked me to do  

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:23.360
this until this morning and i was like oh but 
as i my initial reaction being human to be like  

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:31.120
what am i gonna say um worship was amazing by 
the way um it always is whenever we can worship  

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.120
our father um but just i felt like that 
um as i prepared a little bit before  

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.640
getting into his word and then um just listening 
to the music and just worshiping with you guys  

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.680
the lord just really just very evidently 
reminded me that what hasn't he done for me  

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.200
god is so faithful he's just so faithful so first 
of all he saved me he sent jesus and that's like  

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.840
the most important thing right um to die for my 
sons and um so for that i'll forever be grateful  

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:13.040
um and then also just his presence my life like 
um just you know walking through i could tell you  

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.120
time and time again you know the little things 
where he's been present and he's been there and  

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.920
he's always there that i've been aware of his 
presence is what i should say um but that will  

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.160
take me a very long time so i'm not going to 
do that but i will tell you a couple things one  

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:38.080
was um whenever ben came to know christ i was the 
believer before him we got married when he wasn't  

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:45.120
and i wasn't living like a believer and so god and 
his grace and his mercy pulled me back and saved  

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.280
him and then called us to ministry and little did 
i know what that was going to look like for our  

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.040
lives to start in a little town in oklahoma 
bringing us to cincinnati and to start this  

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.640
church and for us to meet you guys because if that 
wouldn't have happened then we wouldn't be where  

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:07.040
we're at and so it's just amazing um where god has 
brought us but it hasn't always been cupcakes and  

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.520
rainbows i mean we obviously had to move away from 
a lot of people that we know and they love but we  

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:20.080
get to love more so it's been great um another 
situation was when um our youngest daughter  

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.120
she was fighting for her life when she was a 
month old and we actually almost lost her and god  

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:35.280
in his mercy and his he just so graciously 
decided to kill her the side of um heaven and um  

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.960
that was that was a lot but he was faithful 
in that as well um he would have been faithful  

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:48.640
even if he wouldn't have so let me say that but 
that was so good um and like i said just just a  

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.600
lot of things where he's just kind of put things 
into place of selling our home before we got here  

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.520
um just little things but anyways so like i said 
if i went into a lot of it it would take me all  

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.200
day and i don't want to do that because 
you guys want to hear my lovely husband  

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:11.200
um so in first i've been studying for the book of 
first peter and so in first peter in first peter  

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:17.440
he reminds us in verse or chapter one verse two 
it says god the father knew you and chose you long  

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:25.840
ago and his spirit has made you holy and so just 
being reminded that like he knew me before and he  

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:32.320
knows me and he chose me and he chose every one of 
you and he knows every one of you and so because  

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:39.760
of that and what he's done by sending jesus i 
i it's not even a question in my mind like why  

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:46.800
would i not live for christ because of what he's 
done do i always get it right absolutely not but  

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:55.680
i strive because i want to do what he wants me 
to do not because i have to but because i get to  

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:04.880
and then in verse or in chapter 2 verse 24 it says 
he personally carried our sins in his body on the  

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:14.400
cross so that we can be dead to sin and live for 
what is right so um it's not even a question of  

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:22.800
well you can if you want to like it's a command 
live for what is right but it's not a because we  

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:29.440
have to when you can change that in your thinking 
too i get to because of what christ has done  

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:39.520
for me it just it's it's freeing being able to 
surrender your life in your heart um yeah okay

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.320
so i think it's important um if you guys 
are anything like me there's times i read  

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.520
the scripture and i'm like okay well that's true 
in their day that doesn't happen anymore but i  

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.000
want to see that evidence today and for for you 
and again this short small picture if you want  

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.760
to know more details have a longer conversation 
with brittany because you'll see story after story  

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:14.400
after story and god's presence what god has done 
for our family obviously salvation is number one  

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:20.320
but there's so much more that god has done and 
because of what god has done we strive to live  

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.280
inspired we strive to live for him not because we 
have to but we get to i think that's the hard part  

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:31.760
with religions um a lot of times it's misuntrue 
that this idea that we do something because we  

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.680
have to that's what we're supposed to that's 
the expectation it's the wrong heart you've  

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.280
missed it you've missed the love and the grace 
of god god has a purpose for you to live with  

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:48.080
freedom for something greater than yourself and 
so i'm hoping today you're going to see this and  

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:54.400
so um we walk through again therefore based on all 
that god has done for us here's some things that  

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.120
we walk through in this chapter in chapter five 
he says to imitate god is dearly loved children  

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.360
he says because of what i've done for you walk in 
love because christ gave himself for you then he  

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.960
says this when we talked about this two weeks ago 
walk and talk in purity because it's not valuable  

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:17.200
for you right because what god has done for you 
walk and then he talks about this important thing  

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.160
he says the reason why we don't uh walk in 
impurity and live in impurity is because it's  

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.200
not pondering to god but he says it's not named 
among those who are followers of god it's not  

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.920
valuable for him and and we're going to talk 
more about that that's darkness but then in  

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.960
verse seven i mean this is the verse right we're 
going to jump into he says don't become partners  

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.600
with those who walk in darkness those who are 
walking in in purity because again these are  

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.840
things that are not associated with god so we've 
been changed therefore if we've been changed by  

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:53.520
god why would we walk in things that are not of 
god and it's not because we don't you know have  

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.040
our it's not because you know god's like i want to 
make sure that you don't get to do fun things it's  

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.880
not about what it is it's really about i've got 
so many things that are better than that darkness  

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.840
for you to walk in and so we're going 
to read today's text again in light of  

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.440
everything that god has done for us and if god 
hasn't done something for you maybe you don't  

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.600
know that here's my encouragement is 
sometimes you have to lean on somebody else's  

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:21.680
life change and say man because of what god 
said in your life i'm going to come to jesus  

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.480
and realize what god's done in my life or 
what god's going to do in my life i know  

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.240
that's difficult it's difficult when you hear them 
you're like well god's never done anything for me  

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.960
and if that's you today i want to talk with you 
i want you to know god has done something for you  

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.240
and it was sending his son jesus down across the 
trigger god has done something for you because  

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.480
today you're in a service field to hear his 
love and grace and mercy that he gives to you  

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.280
god has done so much for you so let's read these 
these verses here again in ephesians chapter 5  

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:56.560
uh verses 8 through 14 and it says this in verse 
8 for you were once darkness but now you are light  

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.800
in the lord live as children of light for 
the fruit of light consists of all goodness  

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.560
righteousness and truth testing what is pleasing 
to the lord don't participate in the fruitless  

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:15.120
works of darkness but instead expose them for it 
is shame it is shameful even to mention what is  

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:22.320
done by them in secret everything exposed by light 
is made visible for what makes everything visible  

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:28.880
it's light therefore it is said get up sleeper 
and rise up from the dead and christ will shine  

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:35.200
on you let's pray lord jesus thank you again for 
this opportunity to walk through your word lord  

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.520
and and be changed so lord i just pray for all of 
us to open our hearts and our minds to your word  

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:48.160
and lord be changed to live us though it's true 
in our life and so we just pray this nearly amen  

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:54.000
so we see in verses 8 through 10 um this is where 
i'll say where paul is challenging us to live  

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.960
inspired and so you'll say where's that text at 
um so i'll just kind of mention here he says go  

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:05.120
live as children of light go delivers children 
of light and so to live inspired is to to live  

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.440
his life to the world but the first things i want 
to talk about we're going to kind of walk through  

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.520
these verses that's one of the things i love to 
be able to do is not just cover an idea but to  

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.160
walk through the verses and see exactly what is in 
every one of them so the first thing that he says  

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.680
here in verse 8 is for you are once darkness again 
paul's speaking directly to believers those who  

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:30.560
follow jesus so you were once living in darkness 
and meaning we are to not walk in darkness still  

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.640
um but we were one that began to think about 
verse seven we were ones that were partners with  

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:42.400
those who were imperial but we're not mean right 
that's that's the statement but paul's speaking  

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.440
to believers because he's wanting to remind them 
hey don't continue to walk this way but so the  

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.520
question i ask myself is okay so if what i used 
to do was walking in darkness what is darkness  

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:59.600
what was darkness and that's the part where let's 
look back one one and maybe one page for you but  

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.320
it's ephesians chapter two if you don't wanna 
turn there ephesians chapter two verses one  

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:12.000
through three talk about what is darkness it 
says you were dead in your trespasses and sins  

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.880
in which you previously lived according to the 
ways of this world according to the ruler of the  

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.960
power of the heir and the spirit now working in 
the disobedient we too all were previously lived  

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.160
among them in our flesh fleshly desires carrying 
out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts  

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.760
and we were by nature as children under wrath 
as with others also so what does that mean  

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.680
without christ we were in darkness 
we were living for ourselves we were  

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:46.720
we were not we had no clue who god was that's 
really the idea we were living without purpose  

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.040
and so that's where we were as as a non-liver and 
so this is the part i want to be as clear as i  

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.840
can i don't assume everybody in this room knows 
jesus and it's like okay i've given my life to  

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.560
jesus and so maybe you're saying this so you're 
saying i'm walking in darkness right now well i  

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:07.760
actually i'm not god's word is but but here's 
the key thing when you hear somebody talking  

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.400
about that maybe you're walking in darkness right 
now that's not to be like oh gosh you're less i  

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.560
said oh man that you're a horrible person you 
know what it really is saying you don't have to  

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.720
it's not god's best for you it's not good for 
you to walk in darkness because we just we talked  

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.960
about that at the beginning right we all like 
light we like flipping the light because it brings  

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.080
about where we're not scared anymore we get to 
see things clearly right so what god's saying is  

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:39.360
don't walk in darkness he said that was your 
former ways right and i think about this and  

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.320
in our lives when we were walking in darkness and 
i think back to my family we used to live out in  

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.800
the woods and my grandma lived down the road from 
this and i used to walk to my grandmas every day  

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.360
down this one path and everybody knows this if you 
consistently and especially one time aggressive  

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.800
you want the same path what do you make a path or 
a rug right you end up making these pathways like  

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.280
this line in the grass i'm like my grandma 
was like you need to stop walking that same  

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.560
path because you're causing her grasp to look 
back so i started walking down the gravel road  

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:14.640
okay here's what god's saying you're walking down 
the wrong path you're creating a rut in your life  

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:22.720
that is destroying you there's a better path one 
that won't be destroyed one that is clear one that  

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:29.440
is a guide to guiding you one that is light not 
darkness that's exactly what paul is saying here  

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:35.520
don't walk in darkness like he used to so then 
he moves on in the second part of this verse  

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:45.040
and he says okay so you were once darkness but 
now you are light in the lord so here's the other  

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.520
thing okay ben you've already made this statement 
i need to go live inspired by how do i do it  

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:58.080
well here's the good news it's not you it's in 
the lord it's what the lord gives you to be able  

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.800
to walk in line it's not on your own power or your 
own abilities because if you're anything like me  

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.600
you wake up in the morning you look in the mirror 
and you say you don't have any potential you're  

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:13.120
not good you're not really that great at anything 
how can god use you and this is what god's saying  

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.800
that's exactly why i can't use you because you 
are nothing let me understand this you are nothing  

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.360
meaning compared to his power and his ability to 
work in you you are nothing we can bring nothing  

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:29.280
to the table but our obedience our surrender and 
our faith we bring that to him and he says i can  

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:35.360
use it but if we bring our pride and our gifts and 
everything that we're good at god you can use this  

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:40.800
and god's saying no i don't want that i want you 
i want you fully surrendered i want you because  

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:49.120
i'm gonna put lightning to be able to be like 
to the world so again he says how how do we um  

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.440
when we think about this we're walking in the 
lord but then i ask this question so how do we  

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.880
become light how did we become one in the 
lord so here's great i love how paul does  

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.960
this let's go back to ephesians 2 and see how we 
became one so in ephesians 2 starting in verse 4  

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:11.200
it describes how he became what in the lord and 
he says this but god and this is the greatest  

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:17.680
two words in the bible when you hear above god it 
means god has chosen to change your circumstances

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:26.400
and we are thankful that he did but god who is 
rich in mercy which mercy is not giving what  

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.080
you deserve right who's rich in mercy because 
of his great love that he had for us he made  

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.800
us alive he said we're not dead anymore we're 
alive in christ even though we were dead in our  

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:41.280
trespasses he says you were saved by grace which 
means he gave you something you didn't deserve  

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.240
he said you were saved by grace he also 
raised you up with him speaking of christ  

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:52.400
and seated him in the heavens in christ jesus 
so that in the coming ages he might display the  

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:59.360
invisible riches of his grace through his kindness 
to us in christ jesus for you were saved by grace  

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:05.520
through faith and this is not of yourself it is of 
god's gift not from works so that no one can boast  

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.160
for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus 
for good works which god prepared ahead of time  

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:15.600
for us to do and i know that's a lot of scripture 
i challenge you you're wanting to know what was  

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.760
life like when you were dark when you were in 
darkness go to ephesians 2 read the first three  

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.080
verses if you're wondering what it is like and 
how you were able to receive white go to ephesians  

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:31.520
2 and 3 3 10 and begin to process that and talk 
through that and realize what god has done for you  

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.760
and so we're raised to life in 
christ we're no longer dead right  

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.400
and i i heard this statement the other day and it 
challenged me and and and i had to listen to it  

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.640
again and i had to listen to it again and then i 
had to write it down and i had to think on it the  

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:53.440
two greatest things the two most important dates 
and days in your life are the day you were born  

00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:00.000
and the day you learned why you're born i'm 
gonna say that again the two most important  

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.000
days in your life was the day you're born and the 
day you learn why you're born why do i say that  

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.520
the moment that you learn that you were born 
for a greater purpose than to just live and die  

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:20.000
is a day that will change your life it'll change 
your life it changed mine 11 years ago it changed  

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.400
my life when i realized it wasn't about me what 
i mean by that it wasn't about me it wasn't about  

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.720
all the money i could make and how good of a job 
i could get and how many cars i could own how  

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.600
many things i could have and all these things that 
was about me i realized it was a greater purpose  

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.720
because those things are not guaranteed here's the 
reason why people are dying every day unexpectedly  

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.640
why because nobody knows when they're gonna 
die nobody knows when this life is gonna pass  

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.840
so if i'm living for this world it's fleeting 
but if we're living for the next world which  

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:57.840
means where we're going to be with christ in 
heaven where we will be spending an eternity  

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.360
then i can live now in that light and i can 
live with the purpose not only to experience  

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.280
that relationship with god and what what is god 
leading me here for this is the challenge to you  

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.320
if you have given your life to christ and you're 
still here today which here's the thing i see you  

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:19.680
so you can't hide you're still here god's not 
done with you god is not done with you again  

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:27.040
so the question i want you to ask yourself today 
is why why and it's not to wake up tomorrow and  

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.680
go to work and what i mean by that it's not 
just to go through the motions and get through  

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:38.720
life there's someone waiting on you on the other 
side of obedience there's someone waiting on you  

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:46.000
to live inspire that makes sense so paul is saying 
you're not living in darkness you're living and  

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.320
like you're children of light when we think about 
this and i think this is the part i want to take  

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.160
a couple of minutes to talk about is we've been 
talking about all these things we're not to walk  

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:02.720
into impurity and sometimes we even talk a little 
about this in our group is we struggle with sin  

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.400
right so so can god still use me can god forgive 
him absolutely and here's the important part grace  

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.280
is freely giving grace it's again giving us 
what we don't deserve forgiveness of our sins  

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.400
so if you're walking in darkness or you have some 
things that are dark in your life you can ask god  

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.960
to forgive you and you can walk in mind you'll be 
forgiven this is the idea of this thing the other  

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.640
day grace is not a license to sin which means 
we don't continue to sin because oh we got grace  

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:35.760
no grace as a license to win what does that mean 
to be used for god's glory because he has such a  

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.480
plan for me so then he jumps down here this is the 
cool part paul begins to explain even more what it  

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:47.120
looks like to live inspired he goes down and he 
says in verse 9 he says for the fruit of light  

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.280
or the the response to god living inside of 
you the life that's inside of you is this  

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.200
he says consists of all goodness righteousness 
and truth testing what is pleasing to the lord  

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:05.280
so these two verses talk about what it looks like 
to live inspired so what is fruit against what we  

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.640
produce or what we what comes out of our lives 
because we have been given the light of christ  

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:16.960
inside of us and he says goodness righteousness 
and truth so let's talk through this one if if  

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.840
my kids would know this the fruits of the spirit 
does anybody know that goodness is part of the  

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.240
fruits of the spirit that's something that god 
gives you i think that's in galatians but those  

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.800
are some of the things that god gives us that 
are fruit of light but he talks about goodness  

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:36.480
and really what goodness is it's love and action 
it's love and action so think about this he says  

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:43.200
walk in love and this is in verse 2 of chapter 5 
of ephesians paul is calling us to walk in love  

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:49.280
all paul is doing is affirming the fruit of that 
is walk in love goodness here's another fruit he  

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.080
says righteousness that's a big word i know that 
i struggle with some of the big words in the bible  

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.040
as anybody else i go i'm telling you probably 
every couple of words i need to go look that up  

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.920
and that's okay that's good right and he 
says righteousness so what is righteousness  

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.800
integrity virtue purity of life and that sounds 
familiar we just got to talk about purity right  

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:15.360
um and i'll make it look more simple rightness 
correct thinking feeling and acting and so again  

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:21.200
you're thinking that's legalistic that's like me 
trying to be all right it's this idea really that  

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.320
is this right living before god and right living 
before others righteousness is right living before  

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:31.760
god and right living before others and then 
he uses this word truth and if you think about  

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.960
the first two that he gave is really a response 
of truth truth is found in god's word so god's  

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:43.600
word is truth and so he says the fruit of light 
basically is goodness righteousness and truth  

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:55.840
and so then here's the other side that 
i think about is if we do follow jesus

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:15.840
yes yes so how do we produce something we don't 
know we don't experience right and this is the  

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:21.680
part where we cannot produce the fruit of life 
if we don't know jesus i i've done it before  

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.840
guys let me give you a great example before i 
gave my life to christ i spent a year in church  

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.960
a year and you know what i did 
every time i came i'm not ready

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.880
because i haven't cleaned my life so 
i'll go home and i would try to do better  

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.000
and it didn't work and i come 
back the next week and i go  

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:48.480
he's offering me raise but i've got to do 
something i've got to work for it and it doesn't  

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.200
work so when we're sitting here saying okay i 
want to live inspire i want to live for jesus

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.720
but i don't follow him daily 
and then follow his word  

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.920
then you're getting basically the card before 
the horse right you need to give our lives to  

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.680
jesus we need to follow him daily we'll know 
how to live the way he's called us to live  

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.400
and so he says this in verse 10 
this is this is a great part he says  

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.920
testing what is pleasing to the lord testing 
what is pleasing to the lord right these are  

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:26.480
the fruit he says testing that what is the most 
let me ask this i haven't got you guys engaged  

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:33.840
quick enough what does it mean when somebody gives 
you a test like what's what are they looking for

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.400
see what you know assess where you're at 
right so that makes sense and if anybody's  

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.360
like me when i used to take tests in 
college in high school i hated them  

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.320
and here's the major reason why i 
was cramming the morning of tests so  

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:58.080
don't do that it's not good but the purpose 
of test is really truly seeing if we're living  

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:06.720
inspired and so how do we test ourselves here's 
a great example how he just gave you three ways  

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:14.320
to live inspire goodness righteousness truth you 
test everything you do in light of those things  

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.680
do they align so let me 
give you some practice here  

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:25.520
an example is is how i treat my wife or my husband 
or my kids or my co-workers honoring to god  

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.600
it is what i watch look at and talk about 
is it right living before god and others  

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:39.840
is my job my relationships my activities showing 
love the love of christ others right so we are  

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.920
able to filter through test everything we do as 
if we're walking in line or not right and if it  

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:52.160
doesn't honor god or if it isn't righteousness 
right living before god or if it isn't honoring to  

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.440
god and how i walk our liver if 
i'm not showing the love of christ  

00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:02.000
that test proves i'm not prepared i'm not ready 
i'm not right living i'm not living inspired  

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:10.000
what's the response repentance and seeking god for 
help to the walking inspire here's the other thing  

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.000
god never called us to walk alone so whenever 
i say living inspired this isn't an individual  

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.320
thing this is a group thing we are the body of 
christ and we inspire those around us by how we  

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.760
work together to do that that's the 
cool part with that right so why do we

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.240
test ourselves why do we walk in line and here's 
the reason why matthew 5 16 says this let your  

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.080
lies shine before others so that they may 
see your good works and give glory to god  

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.240
glory to your father in heaven  

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.160
you ever heard somebody say it's my life my 
choices i'm the only person affecting this myself  

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:54.400
it's a total lie it's total life see as a believer 
there's times where we come to faith in christ  

00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:02.640
and we think so individually that we forget the 
word witness to other people yes the price tag  

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.160
for you your personal daily relationship is 
so important but that is designed for you to  

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:13.200
influence everybody else right light shines 
in darkness light shines to those around you  

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:19.600
so because our purpose is to live a life that 
shows christ others around us right this is  

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:27.360
why we here at inspiring hope want to teach 
model live and challenge you to live inspired  

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.200
are we perfect absolutely not but we're 
going to continue to follow jesus we're  

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:37.040
going to continue to challenge each other to be 
a light to those around us we need to be alive  

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.720
to shine and shining light to those around us 
who are still walking in darkness and we're  

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:46.720
going to jump into that i'm going to try to move 
a little bit quicker because i know all kinds but  

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.920
the next couple verses are important and if you 
read them wrong you're going to be really maybe  

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.840
convicted or challenging this but i want you 
to see some really good truths in this he says  

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.400
this he says okay this is what please the lord 
live it live as children of light and here's the  

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.880
fruit of it and test it and everything but then 
he says don't participate in the fruitless works  

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.560
of darkness but instead expose them for it is 
even shameful to mention what is done in secret  

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.920
so we're not supposed to participate 
in fruitless works right we know what  

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.400
light does light expels darkness the moment you 
turn on the light in this room darkness is gone  

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:29.920
so yes light exposes what's wrong so as we 
live in this fire it's going to expose the  

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:36.320
darkness to truth of really god's word 
and his will but paul says they're not  

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:40.400
this darkness is fruitless right and we 
understand fruitless meaning it's not beneficial  

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:46.240
it's not beneficial for you to walk in darkness 
it's not valuable it drives you away from what  

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:52.320
god's plan is for you but paul is speaking to 
believers so here's what i look at this text  

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.840
he's not speaking to unbelievers who are 
walking in darkness he's speaking to the church  

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:02.000
so paul's speaking to you he's saying 
participate in darkness don't walk in darkness  

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.480
so why does it matter if maybe there's some areas 
of your life that you're walking in darkness it's  

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:14.240
only you to turn that team right mom dad i want 
to ask this question your kids are watching  

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:19.200
we've talked about this a couple weeks ago right 
we are imitating jesus and as we imitate jesus  

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.720
we're really imitating our father in heaven god 
and our kids imitate us and so our kids get our  

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.960
greatest influences from us so mom and dad that 
darkness that you're wanting to continue to hide  

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.840
does your child see it are they 
walking in it that's a challenge to me  

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.760
but i think of this my mom and dad and 
you guys may have had the same experiences  

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.960
as a kid your mom and dad were smoking the car 
and crack the window and say smoke's gone out the  

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.920
window it's not getting back there even though 
you were complaining you were choking on smoke  

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.320
it's not affecting you it's only affecting me 
that's what my parents used to say now i'm the  

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:56.000
one smoking it's not about you i'm like no you're 
influenced me by a second-hand smoke why is paul  

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.360
saying don't participate in darkness as believers 
because somebody is being influenced by your walk  

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.680
somebody's been influenced by your walk and you 
may say but it's but it's only mine you know grace  

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.520
you know grace abounds and it's only between 
me and the lord you know don't judge me and  

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.880
that's not what we're trying to do here that's not 
what wall street paul's saying it's not valuable  

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:24.480
for you and it's not valuable for your purpose 
your call as a christ father to live and that's  

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.720
a challenging statement for you guys i want to 
tell you this if i'm the only person accountable  

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.400
there's a likely chance that i won't wake up so 
you used to i'm pretty good at working out every  

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.160
morning now with my alarm but even brittany knows 
that person is way more sometimes than i should  

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.720
but when there's somebody waiting 
for me at the gym i get up every time  

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.320
see this is the part when we understand this is 
paul saying accountability don't walk in darkness  

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:52.480
not just for yourself but for others that are 
watching you or others that are watching you and  

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.800
then he even goes on a little bit more he says 
expose right so i mean that's a little bit of a  

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.920
challenging statement what does it mean to expose 
don't participate but expose so it doesn't mean  

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.880
this don't go on social media and blast all over 
social media that's joe bob and tag him has been  

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.960
out at the bar it's too late right don't go do 
that that's not what god's saying about exposing  

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.800
i don't even know who joe bob is and i don't 
know if he's been at the bar once i'm sorry  

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.720
um i use joe bob a lot that's 
just kind of a guy sorry joe  

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:32.720
i gotta come up with a different name sorry not 
this okay see i keep getting lost i'm so sorry  

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:40.560
so here's really where he talks about exposing it 
starts with you guys i'm telling you the church  

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:49.600
is known for their gossip and wanting to under 
the you know what we're supposed to expose in  

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:55.360
talking about joe rog or now 10 somebody 
whatever his name's going to be now in the  

00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:00.240
future we do it as though we're exposing we 
need to tell everybody on facebook we need to  

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.240
go tell everybody in our circles and expose him 
that's not what he's talking about expose you  

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.720
it starts here stop trying to expose somebody 
else's sins until you've exposed yours  

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:17.360
completely to the lord this is what paul's 
saying don't walk in darkness expose them  

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.840
don't associate participate with them and as 
you do you will be so humbled that when you see  

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:30.640
somebody else walking in darkness you'll feel 
so broken for them not judgmental broken that  

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:35.040
they're walking in it and you want them to be free 
from it so you know what you do you come alongside  

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.120
them and you say hey i'm seeing something in 
life that's not valuable let me tell you this  

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.600
i've struggled with some areas like that 
before maybe it's not the exact same  

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.840
and here's how overcoming because i found there 
wasn't value for me and i've got freedom and  

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:53.200
now i'm living with a purpose and i'm seeing life 
change see we expose first ourselves then we have  

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.880
the right heart to come alongside biblically 
other people who are struggling the darkness  

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.960
is the way god's called us to do it 
so james 5 19 through 21 says this  

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.680
my brothers and sisters if anyone among you 
strays from the truth someone who turns him back  

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.520
and someone turns him back let that person 
know that whoever turns the center from error  

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:20.560
of his way will save his soul from death and get 
to cover once to their sins so it is our role as  

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:26.320
believers to help people expose our sin right in 
a way that is honoring coming alongside them right  

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:33.360
helping them restore them back to the faith so 
many times if you miss that we miss that and then  

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.840
he talks about it's even shameful to mention so 
why is the question why is it shameful to mention  

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:41.360
this guy talking about all these impurities 
right the more you talk about something  

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.880
the more you think about something the more you 
desire something and you'll catch yourself sin so  

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:54.480
when he says don't even talk about or name these 
things among you it's not valuable for you or the  

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.560
hearer because sometimes that will lead you to 
sin and so this is the part where i've challenged  

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:04.560
you um if you haven't heard this challenge before 
i hope you hear it today is we don't just say  

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:11.360
no to things we say yes to jesus so when we're 
walking with someone who's dealing with darkness  

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.160
we don't sit there okay this is another great 
example somebody's dealing with pornography issues  

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:20.080
right you're not going to sit there and keep 
talking about those issues consistently right and  

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.920
all the ways that they know because why they're 
should keep thinking about right what you're  

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.000
going to do is spend more time talking about 
how to renew your mind on god's truth and word  

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.160
and the purity that he gives us through a right 
relationship with him in a right relationship  

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.840
with those types of relationships right focus 
on those things not on the impurity it's not  

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.560
valuable for them it's not valuable for you and 
so here's the the challenge to you is you may  

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.800
be thinking of this and this is the first thing 
i've thought about well jesus sat with sinners  

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.560
here's the interesting part jesus sat with sinners 
and he was centered but he didn't send me centers  

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:59.920
that's right he was the greatest example yes you 
know what honestly if you said have any dinner  

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.200
with me there's some people are gonna hang out 
and do this next steps lunch you're going to be  

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.360
sitting in the center hopefully i'm not walking 
in darkness i pray i'm not walking darkness right  

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.280
but we sit with other people 
that are struggling in our walks  

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.840
but we don't have to participate with what they're 
struggling with and then that's soaking that's so  

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.560
key for us to know and it's not because you 
don't get to or you may it's it's it's not  

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:28.320
beneficial for you it's not beneficial for them 
so let's look at this last couple verses and i'm

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:35.520
serious challenged by this thought 
is when light exposes darkness

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.200
there's sometimes a reason why 
people don't walk in the church doors  

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.200
because when we're talking huge thing if you're 
sitting in the seats today and you're hearing  

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:49.280
god's word and you're you're struggling to 
sit here because you just want to run i get it  

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.320
because light is being preached and talked 
about today and it may be poking hole in the  

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:59.760
darkness and you don't like it i've been there and 
honestly i think i spend monday through sunday in  

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:05.120
daily work sometimes you look at the word and he's 
that light is cleaning the darkness in my life  

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.360
so sometimes there's people that don't show 
up to church because of that there's sometimes  

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:16.160
where people basically won't even talk about 
religious things with you because any time you  

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:23.280
shine the light of christ darwin says god so this 
is just a reminder it's not easy when light hits  

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.880
darkness because sometimes we want to run and 
sometimes other people want to learn from you  

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:34.000
but love people where they're at and don't be 
afraid to do share that light with them but he  

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.440
says this in verses 13 and 14 he says everything 
exposed to the light is made invisible for what  

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.120
makes everything visible is what and that's such 
a logical text if you don't understand that text  

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:48.560
i love i love that right i seriously wrote that 
text out and i'm like so how do i explain this  

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:53.280
it did it explained itself right 
everything exposed to life is made visible  

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.360
that makes everything invisible's life that 
i love text like that right so it makes sense  

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:04.000
when we expose darkness to light darkness in 
our lives darkness in other people's lights  

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:10.640
it is made visible what they need to make return 
from our penta so what should our response be  

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:18.400
today what should our response be verse 14 says 
get upstairs and rise upon the dead and christ  

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.280
will shine on you again paul speaking directly 
to believers if you're struggling with walking  

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.040
in darkness or talking about it or any of 
things we've been dealing with maybe guys  

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:33.280
just speaking to you today that you need to turn 
from here's what paul's saying get up sleeper stop  

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:39.680
stop walking as though you don't know what life 
is experience it rise from the dead just like  

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:44.800
just like christ said quit living like you used to 
dead in your sins right christ is ready to shine  

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.280
and i was challenged by this 
statement as i was studying  

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.440
we you know we're supposed to shine our whites 
and the first thing i think of is the sun  

00:40:54.240 --> 00:41:00.080
see we're not suns in the world that's actually 
jesus we're a moon what's the moon dude  

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:08.160
it reflects the sun so we are only 
light because we reflect jesus to others  

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:15.680
so what's your take away if you're believing 
today you're walking with jesus um it's time to  

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:21.600
start living inspired i i hope today's text is 
challenging you to lean in and say lord use me  

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:28.640
like you've never used me before allow me to stop 
walking darkness right no excuses no excuses it's  

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.480
time to give your life fully to jesus and walk and 
live because there's someone waiting for you right  

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.800
so how do we respond repentance this 
is the thing repentance doesn't happen  

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:42.720
just as salvation it happens every day god is 
there every day is saying i'm ready and welcome  

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.960
so there's multiple days i'm asking god to 
forgive me and turn for my sins and to walk  

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:53.840
in freedom here's my challenge to you 
may believe that you can change the world  

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.600
i made that statement the other day 
to some teachers and administrators  

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.880
i said do you think you could change the world 
and they kind of stared at me changed the world  

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:08.160
i had a big task i said absolutely you could 
change the world why how by living inspired  

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:17.600
if you do there's gonna be one person maybe two 
maybe three that you could change their eternity  

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:24.160
where they spend their eternity either in heaven 
wow yeah you can change the world with one person

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.680
maybe you don't know christ this is the last way 
i want to kind of end today maybe you don't know  

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.720
christ maybe you're questioning what it is to have 
a relationship with him and he here's the thing  

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.240
if you're questioning that totally get it 
in there it's been a year i spent a year  

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.040
questioning what it is in a relationship 
with jesus and that's okay because you  

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:49.600
are questioning and that's what i'm here for i 
want you to know that i want to talk with you i  

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:53.760
want to talk through what that means to follow 
jesus i want to talk through how it is maybe  

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.000
you're struggling with darkness how to overcome 
that and guess what my guide's gonna be like  

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.640
jesus it's not gonna be in ben's wisdom because i 
don't got it it's got god's wisdom right i don't  

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:11.360
got it but he does so your next step today 
is important everybody has the next step  

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.840
and i know we're going to do a next steps 
lunch but if you're not going to that  

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:20.160
everybody has the next step today whether 
you're a follower of jesus or not what are  

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:25.040
you trying to hide from god that god already 
sees what darkness are you trying to hide from  

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.000
during our time of invitation i 
challenge you to give that to god  

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.840
expose it to god ask for 
forgiveness and move from it  

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:39.280
if you don't know jesus maybe that's the darkness 
maybe just the way you've been living maybe you  

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:43.040
don't even realize maybe the way you've been 
living is darkness but you know you need jesus  

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:47.840
your response is to give your life to jesus and 
here's what i've committed to during this time of  

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.640
worship um so we have something called invitation 
and there's too many times i don't explain  

00:43:53.200 --> 00:44:01.040
why we do things invitation is an opportunity to 
invite you into your next step to follow jesus  

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.440
again as a believer it could be repentance 
to live inspire for an unbeliever somebody  

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:10.400
that doesn't know jesus it may just be to 
have the next conversation or it's maybe  

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.240
to give your life to jesus and and i know it's 
so difficult to do that because you're afraid  

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:19.360
so during this time i want you to spend some 
time praying asking god to forgive you or  

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.720
to walk with you to reveal that but 
i'm gonna stay in the back of them  

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.520
because i want to invite anybody that needs to 
be prayed for that has questions about salvation  

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.360
maybe you want to give your life to jesus i 
want to be back here to talk to you because  

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:35.440
i know that sometimes it's difficult to come 
forward right so it's okay to take a step back  

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:41.520
and talk with me um or to be prayed for whatever 
you need i'm gonna be there to be able to walk  

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:46.080
with you through that um and then just spend some 
time worshiping the lord as we conclude with this  

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:53.040
type of invitation so let's pray lord jesus thank 
you again for who you are thank you for your word

00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:05.600
lord i pray today um lord i pray today 
that um i know today there's someone in  

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.520
this room lord that is struggling with giving 
up some darkness in their life lord that that  

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.560
they need to turn from and repent afterwards 
so i just pray that they near this time of  

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:19.360
meditation lord that they open their hearts and 
give it to you and they walk out of this room  

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:29.360
feeling free to live the life that you called them 
to live or i i also in a room lord with people  

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.640
that i have no clue where the relationship with 
you lord i know there's somebody that's wrestling  

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:38.000
or whether they should give their lives to you 
lord whether they have or having questions lord  

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.720
i pray that today they don't wait a year like i 
waited lord that they go and they ask questions  

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:47.520
they go and they ask for prayer where they go 
and they say hey i need to give my life to jesus  

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:55.040
lord we're praying for life change because you've 
changed our lives we believe in the power of  

00:45:55.040 --> 00:46:00.480
salvation we believe in what you are doing in this 
church we believe in what you're doing in our city  

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:05.440
we believe in what you're doing in each one of 
our individual lives lord and so we trust you  

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:11.920

everything all the details lord may we walk  

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:25.040
