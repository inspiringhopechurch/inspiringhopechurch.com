00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
lines exactly with what we are calling um&nbsp;
our church to do is to go live inspired and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.760
it's really cool when it lines up like that&nbsp;
so no every week i'm not able to like twist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.200
the words right i'm not into twisting words i'm&nbsp;
really just taking the text and uh really just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.760
declaring truth that god has reminded us of our&nbsp;
church but anyways um so we'll be walking through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.560
that so today we're gonna be in ephesians chapter&nbsp;
five um and we're gonna start with verse eight so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.320
we've been walking through a lot of things and&nbsp;
again if uh if you don't have a bible i'm just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.440
gonna i say this every week and i'll remind you&nbsp;
every week if you don't have a bible there's two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.560
two ways to get one number one back here on our&nbsp;
table in our next steps table there's a bible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.280
it's yours for free um take one it's yours&nbsp;
number two um the greatest way to take time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.360
with you everywhere you go and not forget it&nbsp;
because we know we don't forget our phones is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.040
to download it and so i use the holy bible app um&nbsp;
why do i encourage that is because i use it and i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.360
see a lot of people use it so get on there follow&nbsp;
some plans and walk you through how to study the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.800
bible it's one of my favorite apps i'll tell you&nbsp;
this i started reading the bible ten times more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.440
when i downloaded the bible that's why&nbsp;
it's there so here's just an encouragement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.440
um it'd be worth it so um we have been walking&nbsp;
through a couple of things but i wanted to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.240
this way i'm just going to highlight a little&nbsp;
bit about what we're going to talk about is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.360
has anybody noticed how important white is i&nbsp;
mean that may sound like a stupid statement how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.800
important life is so when we walk in here on&nbsp;
sunday mornings there's two emergency lights on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.080
which i'll run right now because we'll pull them&nbsp;
up but anyways there's two emergency lights on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.360
but if they're not on we're walking straight&nbsp;
into darkness and so we aren't able to see so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.360
life is obviously important in your life that&nbsp;
makes logical sense but it's very important but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.840
anybody in here ever lost power at night before&nbsp;
you went to bed we're not talking about the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.200
you know home alone one out of nine that my&nbsp;
alarm didn't get reset and now i woke up late&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.800
but what i promise when it's at night&nbsp;
like when you're usually watching tv&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.200
and it's 100 degrees outside because it's summer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.160
and there's no air conditioning right you got&nbsp;
anybody ever lost power during those times i i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.160
know i did as a kid uh more times than i would&nbsp;
like to think as we live down the country and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.840
when you lost power they pretty much forgot about&nbsp;
you until monday but what i found with that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.280
we were always searching for like the moment the&nbsp;
lights went out we were searching for light so my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.000
mom wouldn't grab the candle because we didn't&nbsp;
have phones that could light up anything right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.680
but for us when clients go out we grab our phones&nbsp;
we grab a flashlight and grab a candle because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.400
light is important to us and it's so important&nbsp;
to us and it's so ingrained in our minds that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.080
everybody knows this is the first thing you&nbsp;
do when you wake up and you go into a room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.640
you flip on a mine so again have you ever been in&nbsp;
that room where it's dark and all the lights are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.000
out because the electric's out and you go into a&nbsp;
room even though you know the electrics out and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.600
you flip the switch right it's so driven into&nbsp;
us that it's important for light so i'm saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.600
that to say as you walk through this text today&nbsp;
i want you to understand the importance of light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.120
and how light basically dissipates darkness&nbsp;
because darkness is not what we like being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.480
and we like being in light and that's what god's&nbsp;
called us to be so um we're going to be talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.960
again just the importance of walking in light how&nbsp;
we should look inspired today by shining the light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.520
of christ of those around us but just to kind of&nbsp;
catch you up on where we have been and i'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.280
to take a brief moment to do that and then then i&nbsp;
think it will be great for you to be able to hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.680
from somebody what that means and so we've been&nbsp;
walking through the book of ephesians for the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.960
several months i don't know how long uh probably&nbsp;
since about january um but we have been walking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.200
through these chapters now we're in chapter five&nbsp;
and so for those of you who weren't here in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.760
first couple of chapters it's so important for you&nbsp;
to know these chapters and so ephesians 1 2 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.720
3 talk about what christ or what god has done for&nbsp;
you right what christ or what god has done for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.160
in order for you to experience a relationship with&nbsp;
him in order for you to experience salvation in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.520
order to spend eternity with him and to live with&nbsp;
hope and so he he talked about all these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.240
that he has done for you and then he changes in&nbsp;
chapters four five and six and he says now walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.080
live because of what i've done for you and&nbsp;
so i thought one of the greatest ways for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.680
us to even kind of get an idea of what&nbsp;
that looks like what god has done for us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.240
and why we walk in light or while we walk as&nbsp;
god is called to walk is to hear a testimony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.840
of somebody who talks about what god has done&nbsp;
for them and how they are living because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.200
that hope and if you're wondering have i chose&nbsp;
somebody and i'm going to point you out in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.120
room no i'm not going to put each other&nbsp;
and trust me it's my wife she already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.200
is very prepared and planned so she's going to&nbsp;
take a couple minutes to kind of share her story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.160
about what guy's done for um what god's laid in&nbsp;
her heart and then also the reason why she walks

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.520
i don't know how prepared he's saying but&nbsp;
honestly i forgot that he asked me to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:23.360
this until this morning and i was like oh but&nbsp;
as i my initial reaction being human to be like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:31.120
what am i gonna say um worship was amazing by&nbsp;
the way um it always is whenever we can worship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.120
our father um but just i felt like that&nbsp;
um as i prepared a little bit before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.640
getting into his word and then um just listening&nbsp;
to the music and just worshiping with you guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.680
the lord just really just very evidently&nbsp;
reminded me that what hasn't he done for me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.200
god is so faithful he's just so faithful so first&nbsp;
of all he saved me he sent jesus and that's like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.840
the most important thing right um to die for my&nbsp;
sons and um so for that i'll forever be grateful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:13.040
um and then also just his presence my life like&nbsp;
um just you know walking through i could tell you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.120
time and time again you know the little things&nbsp;
where he's been present and he's been there and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.920
he's always there that i've been aware of his&nbsp;
presence is what i should say um but that will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.160
take me a very long time so i'm not going to&nbsp;
do that but i will tell you a couple things one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:38.080
was um whenever ben came to know christ i was the&nbsp;
believer before him we got married when he wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:45.120
and i wasn't living like a believer and so god and&nbsp;
his grace and his mercy pulled me back and saved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.280
him and then called us to ministry and little did&nbsp;
i know what that was going to look like for our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.040
lives to start in a little town in oklahoma&nbsp;
bringing us to cincinnati and to start this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.640
church and for us to meet you guys because if that&nbsp;
wouldn't have happened then we wouldn't be where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:07.040
we're at and so it's just amazing um where god has&nbsp;
brought us but it hasn't always been cupcakes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.520
rainbows i mean we obviously had to move away from&nbsp;
a lot of people that we know and they love but we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:20.080
get to love more so it's been great um another&nbsp;
situation was when um our youngest daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.120
she was fighting for her life when she was a&nbsp;
month old and we actually almost lost her and god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:35.280
in his mercy and his he just so graciously&nbsp;
decided to kill her the side of um heaven and um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.960
that was that was a lot but he was faithful&nbsp;
in that as well um he would have been faithful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:48.640
even if he wouldn't have so let me say that but&nbsp;
that was so good um and like i said just just a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.600
lot of things where he's just kind of put things&nbsp;
into place of selling our home before we got here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.520
um just little things but anyways so like i said&nbsp;
if i went into a lot of it it would take me all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.200
day and i don't want to do that because&nbsp;
you guys want to hear my lovely husband&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:11.200
um so in first i've been studying for the book of&nbsp;
first peter and so in first peter in first peter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:17.440
he reminds us in verse or chapter one verse two&nbsp;
it says god the father knew you and chose you long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:25.840
ago and his spirit has made you holy and so just&nbsp;
being reminded that like he knew me before and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:32.320
knows me and he chose me and he chose every one of&nbsp;
you and he knows every one of you and so because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:39.760
of that and what he's done by sending jesus i&nbsp;
i it's not even a question in my mind like why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:46.800
would i not live for christ because of what he's&nbsp;
done do i always get it right absolutely not but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:55.680
i strive because i want to do what he wants me&nbsp;
to do not because i have to but because i get to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:04.880
and then in verse or in chapter 2 verse 24 it says&nbsp;
he personally carried our sins in his body on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:14.400
cross so that we can be dead to sin and live for&nbsp;
what is right so um it's not even a question of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:22.800
well you can if you want to like it's a command&nbsp;
live for what is right but it's not a because we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:29.440
have to when you can change that in your thinking&nbsp;
too i get to because of what christ has done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:39.520
for me it just it's it's freeing being able to&nbsp;
surrender your life in your heart um yeah okay

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.320
so i think it's important um if you guys&nbsp;
are anything like me there's times i read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.520
the scripture and i'm like okay well that's true&nbsp;
in their day that doesn't happen anymore but i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.000
want to see that evidence today and for for you&nbsp;
and again this short small picture if you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.760
to know more details have a longer conversation&nbsp;
with brittany because you'll see story after story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:14.400
after story and god's presence what god has done&nbsp;
for our family obviously salvation is number one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:20.320
but there's so much more that god has done and&nbsp;
because of what god has done we strive to live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.280
inspired we strive to live for him not because we&nbsp;
have to but we get to i think that's the hard part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:31.760
with religions um a lot of times it's misuntrue&nbsp;
that this idea that we do something because we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.680
have to that's what we're supposed to that's&nbsp;
the expectation it's the wrong heart you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.280
missed it you've missed the love and the grace&nbsp;
of god god has a purpose for you to live with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:48.080
freedom for something greater than yourself and&nbsp;
so i'm hoping today you're going to see this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:54.400
so um we walk through again therefore based on all&nbsp;
that god has done for us here's some things that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.120
we walk through in this chapter in chapter five&nbsp;
he says to imitate god is dearly loved children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.360
he says because of what i've done for you walk in&nbsp;
love because christ gave himself for you then he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.960
says this when we talked about this two weeks ago&nbsp;
walk and talk in purity because it's not valuable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:17.200
for you right because what god has done for you&nbsp;
walk and then he talks about this important thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.160
he says the reason why we don't uh walk in&nbsp;
impurity and live in impurity is because it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.200
not pondering to god but he says it's not named&nbsp;
among those who are followers of god it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.920
valuable for him and and we're going to talk&nbsp;
more about that that's darkness but then in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.960
verse seven i mean this is the verse right we're&nbsp;
going to jump into he says don't become partners&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.600
with those who walk in darkness those who are&nbsp;
walking in in purity because again these are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.840
things that are not associated with god so we've&nbsp;
been changed therefore if we've been changed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:53.520
god why would we walk in things that are not of&nbsp;
god and it's not because we don't you know have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.040
our it's not because you know god's like i want to&nbsp;
make sure that you don't get to do fun things it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.880
not about what it is it's really about i've got&nbsp;
so many things that are better than that darkness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.840
for you to walk in and so we're going&nbsp;
to read today's text again in light of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.440
everything that god has done for us and if god&nbsp;
hasn't done something for you maybe you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.600
know that here's my encouragement is&nbsp;
sometimes you have to lean on somebody else's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:21.680
life change and say man because of what god&nbsp;
said in your life i'm going to come to jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.480
and realize what god's done in my life or&nbsp;
what god's going to do in my life i know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.240
that's difficult it's difficult when you hear them&nbsp;
you're like well god's never done anything for me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.960
and if that's you today i want to talk with you&nbsp;
i want you to know god has done something for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.240
and it was sending his son jesus down across the&nbsp;
trigger god has done something for you because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.480
today you're in a service field to hear his&nbsp;
love and grace and mercy that he gives to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.280
god has done so much for you so let's read these&nbsp;
these verses here again in ephesians chapter 5&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:56.560
uh verses 8 through 14 and it says this in verse&nbsp;
8 for you were once darkness but now you are light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.800
in the lord live as children of light for&nbsp;
the fruit of light consists of all goodness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.560
righteousness and truth testing what is pleasing&nbsp;
to the lord don't participate in the fruitless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:15.120
works of darkness but instead expose them for it&nbsp;
is shame it is shameful even to mention what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:22.320
done by them in secret everything exposed by light&nbsp;
is made visible for what makes everything visible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:28.880
it's light therefore it is said get up sleeper&nbsp;
and rise up from the dead and christ will shine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:35.200
on you let's pray lord jesus thank you again for&nbsp;
this opportunity to walk through your word lord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.520
and and be changed so lord i just pray for all of&nbsp;
us to open our hearts and our minds to your word&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:48.160
and lord be changed to live us though it's true&nbsp;
in our life and so we just pray this nearly amen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:54.000
so we see in verses 8 through 10 um this is where&nbsp;
i'll say where paul is challenging us to live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.960
inspired and so you'll say where's that text at&nbsp;
um so i'll just kind of mention here he says go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:05.120
live as children of light go delivers children&nbsp;
of light and so to live inspired is to to live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.440
his life to the world but the first things i want&nbsp;
to talk about we're going to kind of walk through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.520
these verses that's one of the things i love to&nbsp;
be able to do is not just cover an idea but to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.160
walk through the verses and see exactly what is in&nbsp;
every one of them so the first thing that he says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.680
here in verse 8 is for you are once darkness again&nbsp;
paul's speaking directly to believers those who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:30.560
follow jesus so you were once living in darkness&nbsp;
and meaning we are to not walk in darkness still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.640
um but we were one that began to think about&nbsp;
verse seven we were ones that were partners with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:42.400
those who were imperial but we're not mean right&nbsp;
that's that's the statement but paul's speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.440
to believers because he's wanting to remind them&nbsp;
hey don't continue to walk this way but so the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.520
question i ask myself is okay so if what i used&nbsp;
to do was walking in darkness what is darkness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:59.600
what was darkness and that's the part where let's&nbsp;
look back one one and maybe one page for you but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.320
it's ephesians chapter two if you don't wanna&nbsp;
turn there ephesians chapter two verses one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:12.000
through three talk about what is darkness it&nbsp;
says you were dead in your trespasses and sins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.880
in which you previously lived according to the&nbsp;
ways of this world according to the ruler of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.960
power of the heir and the spirit now working in&nbsp;
the disobedient we too all were previously lived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.160
among them in our flesh fleshly desires carrying&nbsp;
out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.760
and we were by nature as children under wrath&nbsp;
as with others also so what does that mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.680
without christ we were in darkness&nbsp;
we were living for ourselves we were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:46.720
we were not we had no clue who god was that's&nbsp;
really the idea we were living without purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.040
and so that's where we were as as a non-liver and&nbsp;
so this is the part i want to be as clear as i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.840
can i don't assume everybody in this room knows&nbsp;
jesus and it's like okay i've given my life to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.560
jesus and so maybe you're saying this so you're&nbsp;
saying i'm walking in darkness right now well i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:07.760
actually i'm not god's word is but but here's&nbsp;
the key thing when you hear somebody talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.400
about that maybe you're walking in darkness right&nbsp;
now that's not to be like oh gosh you're less i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.560
said oh man that you're a horrible person you&nbsp;
know what it really is saying you don't have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.720
it's not god's best for you it's not good for&nbsp;
you to walk in darkness because we just we talked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.960
about that at the beginning right we all like&nbsp;
light we like flipping the light because it brings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.080
about where we're not scared anymore we get to&nbsp;
see things clearly right so what god's saying is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:39.360
don't walk in darkness he said that was your&nbsp;
former ways right and i think about this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.320
in our lives when we were walking in darkness and&nbsp;
i think back to my family we used to live out in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.800
the woods and my grandma lived down the road from&nbsp;
this and i used to walk to my grandmas every day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.360
down this one path and everybody knows this if you&nbsp;
consistently and especially one time aggressive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.800
you want the same path what do you make a path or&nbsp;
a rug right you end up making these pathways like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.280
this line in the grass i'm like my grandma&nbsp;
was like you need to stop walking that same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.560
path because you're causing her grasp to look&nbsp;
back so i started walking down the gravel road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:14.640
okay here's what god's saying you're walking down&nbsp;
the wrong path you're creating a rut in your life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:22.720
that is destroying you there's a better path one&nbsp;
that won't be destroyed one that is clear one that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:29.440
is a guide to guiding you one that is light not&nbsp;
darkness that's exactly what paul is saying here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:35.520
don't walk in darkness like he used to so then&nbsp;
he moves on in the second part of this verse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:45.040
and he says okay so you were once darkness but&nbsp;
now you are light in the lord so here's the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.520
thing okay ben you've already made this statement&nbsp;
i need to go live inspired by how do i do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:58.080
well here's the good news it's not you it's in&nbsp;
the lord it's what the lord gives you to be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.800
to walk in line it's not on your own power or your&nbsp;
own abilities because if you're anything like me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.600
you wake up in the morning you look in the mirror&nbsp;
and you say you don't have any potential you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:13.120
not good you're not really that great at anything&nbsp;
how can god use you and this is what god's saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.800
that's exactly why i can't use you because you&nbsp;
are nothing let me understand this you are nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.360
meaning compared to his power and his ability to&nbsp;
work in you you are nothing we can bring nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:29.280
to the table but our obedience our surrender and&nbsp;
our faith we bring that to him and he says i can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:35.360
use it but if we bring our pride and our gifts and&nbsp;
everything that we're good at god you can use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:40.800
and god's saying no i don't want that i want you&nbsp;
i want you fully surrendered i want you because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:49.120
i'm gonna put lightning to be able to be like&nbsp;
to the world so again he says how how do we um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.440
when we think about this we're walking in the&nbsp;
lord but then i ask this question so how do we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.880
become light how did we become one in the&nbsp;
lord so here's great i love how paul does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.960
this let's go back to ephesians 2 and see how we&nbsp;
became one so in ephesians 2 starting in verse 4&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:11.200
it describes how he became what in the lord and&nbsp;
he says this but god and this is the greatest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:17.680
two words in the bible when you hear above god it&nbsp;
means god has chosen to change your circumstances

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:26.400
and we are thankful that he did but god who is&nbsp;
rich in mercy which mercy is not giving what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.080
you deserve right who's rich in mercy because&nbsp;
of his great love that he had for us he made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.800
us alive he said we're not dead anymore we're&nbsp;
alive in christ even though we were dead in our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:41.280
trespasses he says you were saved by grace which&nbsp;
means he gave you something you didn't deserve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.240
he said you were saved by grace he also&nbsp;
raised you up with him speaking of christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:52.400
and seated him in the heavens in christ jesus&nbsp;
so that in the coming ages he might display the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:59.360
invisible riches of his grace through his kindness&nbsp;
to us in christ jesus for you were saved by grace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:05.520
through faith and this is not of yourself it is of&nbsp;
god's gift not from works so that no one can boast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.160
for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus&nbsp;
for good works which god prepared ahead of time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:15.600
for us to do and i know that's a lot of scripture&nbsp;
i challenge you you're wanting to know what was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.760
life like when you were dark when you were in&nbsp;
darkness go to ephesians 2 read the first three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.080
verses if you're wondering what it is like and&nbsp;
how you were able to receive white go to ephesians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:31.520
2 and 3 3 10 and begin to process that and talk&nbsp;
through that and realize what god has done for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.760
and so we're raised to life in&nbsp;
christ we're no longer dead right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.400
and i i heard this statement the other day and it&nbsp;
challenged me and and and i had to listen to it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.640
again and i had to listen to it again and then i&nbsp;
had to write it down and i had to think on it the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:53.440
two greatest things the two most important dates&nbsp;
and days in your life are the day you were born&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:00.000
and the day you learned why you're born i'm&nbsp;
gonna say that again the two most important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.000
days in your life was the day you're born and the&nbsp;
day you learn why you're born why do i say that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.520
the moment that you learn that you were born&nbsp;
for a greater purpose than to just live and die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:20.000
is a day that will change your life it'll change&nbsp;
your life it changed mine 11 years ago it changed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.400
my life when i realized it wasn't about me what&nbsp;
i mean by that it wasn't about me it wasn't about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.720
all the money i could make and how good of a job&nbsp;
i could get and how many cars i could own how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.600
many things i could have and all these things that&nbsp;
was about me i realized it was a greater purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.720
because those things are not guaranteed here's the&nbsp;
reason why people are dying every day unexpectedly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.640
why because nobody knows when they're gonna&nbsp;
die nobody knows when this life is gonna pass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.840
so if i'm living for this world it's fleeting&nbsp;
but if we're living for the next world which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:57.840
means where we're going to be with christ in&nbsp;
heaven where we will be spending an eternity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.360
then i can live now in that light and i can&nbsp;
live with the purpose not only to experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.280
that relationship with god and what what is god&nbsp;
leading me here for this is the challenge to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.320
if you have given your life to christ and you're&nbsp;
still here today which here's the thing i see you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:19.680
so you can't hide you're still here god's not&nbsp;
done with you god is not done with you again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:27.040
so the question i want you to ask yourself today&nbsp;
is why why and it's not to wake up tomorrow and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.680
go to work and what i mean by that it's not&nbsp;
just to go through the motions and get through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:38.720
life there's someone waiting on you on the other&nbsp;
side of obedience there's someone waiting on you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:46.000
to live inspire that makes sense so paul is saying&nbsp;
you're not living in darkness you're living and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.320
like you're children of light when we think about&nbsp;
this and i think this is the part i want to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.160
a couple of minutes to talk about is we've been&nbsp;
talking about all these things we're not to walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:02.720
into impurity and sometimes we even talk a little&nbsp;
about this in our group is we struggle with sin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.400
right so so can god still use me can god forgive&nbsp;
him absolutely and here's the important part grace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.280
is freely giving grace it's again giving us&nbsp;
what we don't deserve forgiveness of our sins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.400
so if you're walking in darkness or you have some&nbsp;
things that are dark in your life you can ask god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.960
to forgive you and you can walk in mind you'll be&nbsp;
forgiven this is the idea of this thing the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.640
day grace is not a license to sin which means&nbsp;
we don't continue to sin because oh we got grace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:35.760
no grace as a license to win what does that mean&nbsp;
to be used for god's glory because he has such a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.480
plan for me so then he jumps down here this is the&nbsp;
cool part paul begins to explain even more what it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:47.120
looks like to live inspired he goes down and he&nbsp;
says in verse 9 he says for the fruit of light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.280
or the the response to god living inside of&nbsp;
you the life that's inside of you is this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.200
he says consists of all goodness righteousness&nbsp;
and truth testing what is pleasing to the lord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:05.280
so these two verses talk about what it looks like&nbsp;
to live inspired so what is fruit against what we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.640
produce or what we what comes out of our lives&nbsp;
because we have been given the light of christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:16.960
inside of us and he says goodness righteousness&nbsp;
and truth so let's talk through this one if if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.840
my kids would know this the fruits of the spirit&nbsp;
does anybody know that goodness is part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.240
fruits of the spirit that's something that god&nbsp;
gives you i think that's in galatians but those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.800
are some of the things that god gives us that&nbsp;
are fruit of light but he talks about goodness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:36.480
and really what goodness is it's love and action&nbsp;
it's love and action so think about this he says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:43.200
walk in love and this is in verse 2 of chapter 5&nbsp;
of ephesians paul is calling us to walk in love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:49.280
all paul is doing is affirming the fruit of that&nbsp;
is walk in love goodness here's another fruit he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.080
says righteousness that's a big word i know that&nbsp;
i struggle with some of the big words in the bible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.040
as anybody else i go i'm telling you probably&nbsp;
every couple of words i need to go look that up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.920
and that's okay that's good right and he&nbsp;
says righteousness so what is righteousness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.800
integrity virtue purity of life and that sounds&nbsp;
familiar we just got to talk about purity right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:15.360
um and i'll make it look more simple rightness&nbsp;
correct thinking feeling and acting and so again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:21.200
you're thinking that's legalistic that's like me&nbsp;
trying to be all right it's this idea really that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.320
is this right living before god and right living&nbsp;
before others righteousness is right living before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:31.760
god and right living before others and then&nbsp;
he uses this word truth and if you think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.960
the first two that he gave is really a response&nbsp;
of truth truth is found in god's word so god's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:43.600
word is truth and so he says the fruit of light&nbsp;
basically is goodness righteousness and truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:55.840
and so then here's the other side that&nbsp;
i think about is if we do follow jesus

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:15.840
yes yes so how do we produce something we don't&nbsp;
know we don't experience right and this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:21.680
part where we cannot produce the fruit of life&nbsp;
if we don't know jesus i i've done it before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.840
guys let me give you a great example before i&nbsp;
gave my life to christ i spent a year in church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.960
a year and you know what i did&nbsp;
every time i came i'm not ready

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.880
because i haven't cleaned my life so&nbsp;
i'll go home and i would try to do better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.000
and it didn't work and i come&nbsp;
back the next week and i go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:48.480
he's offering me raise but i've got to do&nbsp;
something i've got to work for it and it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.200
work so when we're sitting here saying okay i&nbsp;
want to live inspire i want to live for jesus

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.720
but i don't follow him daily&nbsp;
and then follow his word&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.920
then you're getting basically the card before&nbsp;
the horse right you need to give our lives to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.680
jesus we need to follow him daily we'll know&nbsp;
how to live the way he's called us to live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.400
and so he says this in verse 10&nbsp;
this is this is a great part he says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.920
testing what is pleasing to the lord testing&nbsp;
what is pleasing to the lord right these are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:26.480
the fruit he says testing that what is the most&nbsp;
let me ask this i haven't got you guys engaged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:33.840
quick enough what does it mean when somebody gives&nbsp;
you a test like what's what are they looking for

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.400
see what you know assess where you're at&nbsp;
right so that makes sense and if anybody's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.360
like me when i used to take tests in&nbsp;
college in high school i hated them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.320
and here's the major reason why i&nbsp;
was cramming the morning of tests so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:58.080
don't do that it's not good but the purpose&nbsp;
of test is really truly seeing if we're living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:06.720
inspired and so how do we test ourselves here's&nbsp;
a great example how he just gave you three ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:14.320
to live inspire goodness righteousness truth you&nbsp;
test everything you do in light of those things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.680
do they align so let me&nbsp;
give you some practice here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:25.520
an example is is how i treat my wife or my husband&nbsp;
or my kids or my co-workers honoring to god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.600
it is what i watch look at and talk about&nbsp;
is it right living before god and others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:39.840
is my job my relationships my activities showing&nbsp;
love the love of christ others right so we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.920
able to filter through test everything we do as&nbsp;
if we're walking in line or not right and if it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:52.160
doesn't honor god or if it isn't righteousness&nbsp;
right living before god or if it isn't honoring to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.440
god and how i walk our liver if&nbsp;
i'm not showing the love of christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:02.000
that test proves i'm not prepared i'm not ready&nbsp;
i'm not right living i'm not living inspired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:10.000
what's the response repentance and seeking god for&nbsp;
help to the walking inspire here's the other thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.000
god never called us to walk alone so whenever&nbsp;
i say living inspired this isn't an individual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.320
thing this is a group thing we are the body of&nbsp;
christ and we inspire those around us by how we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.760
work together to do that that's the&nbsp;
cool part with that right so why do we

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.240
test ourselves why do we walk in line and here's&nbsp;
the reason why matthew 5 16 says this let your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.080
lies shine before others so that they may&nbsp;
see your good works and give glory to god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.240
glory to your father in heaven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.160
you ever heard somebody say it's my life my&nbsp;
choices i'm the only person affecting this myself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:54.400
it's a total lie it's total life see as a believer&nbsp;
there's times where we come to faith in christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:02.640
and we think so individually that we forget the&nbsp;
word witness to other people yes the price tag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.160
for you your personal daily relationship is&nbsp;
so important but that is designed for you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:13.200
influence everybody else right light shines&nbsp;
in darkness light shines to those around you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:19.600
so because our purpose is to live a life that&nbsp;
shows christ others around us right this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:27.360
why we here at inspiring hope want to teach&nbsp;
model live and challenge you to live inspired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.200
are we perfect absolutely not but we're&nbsp;
going to continue to follow jesus we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:37.040
going to continue to challenge each other to be&nbsp;
a light to those around us we need to be alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.720
to shine and shining light to those around us&nbsp;
who are still walking in darkness and we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:46.720
going to jump into that i'm going to try to move&nbsp;
a little bit quicker because i know all kinds but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.920
the next couple verses are important and if you&nbsp;
read them wrong you're going to be really maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.840
convicted or challenging this but i want you&nbsp;
to see some really good truths in this he says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.400
this he says okay this is what please the lord&nbsp;
live it live as children of light and here's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.880
fruit of it and test it and everything but then&nbsp;
he says don't participate in the fruitless works&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.560
of darkness but instead expose them for it is&nbsp;
even shameful to mention what is done in secret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.920
so we're not supposed to participate&nbsp;
in fruitless works right we know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.400
light does light expels darkness the moment you&nbsp;
turn on the light in this room darkness is gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:29.920
so yes light exposes what's wrong so as we&nbsp;
live in this fire it's going to expose the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:36.320
darkness to truth of really god's word&nbsp;
and his will but paul says they're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:40.400
this darkness is fruitless right and we&nbsp;
understand fruitless meaning it's not beneficial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:46.240
it's not beneficial for you to walk in darkness&nbsp;
it's not valuable it drives you away from what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:52.320
god's plan is for you but paul is speaking to&nbsp;
believers so here's what i look at this text&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.840
he's not speaking to unbelievers who are&nbsp;
walking in darkness he's speaking to the church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:02.000
so paul's speaking to you he's saying&nbsp;
participate in darkness don't walk in darkness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.480
so why does it matter if maybe there's some areas&nbsp;
of your life that you're walking in darkness it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:14.240
only you to turn that team right mom dad i want&nbsp;
to ask this question your kids are watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:19.200
we've talked about this a couple weeks ago right&nbsp;
we are imitating jesus and as we imitate jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.720
we're really imitating our father in heaven god&nbsp;
and our kids imitate us and so our kids get our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.960
greatest influences from us so mom and dad that&nbsp;
darkness that you're wanting to continue to hide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.840
does your child see it are they&nbsp;
walking in it that's a challenge to me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.760
but i think of this my mom and dad and&nbsp;
you guys may have had the same experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.960
as a kid your mom and dad were smoking the car&nbsp;
and crack the window and say smoke's gone out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.920
window it's not getting back there even though&nbsp;
you were complaining you were choking on smoke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.320
it's not affecting you it's only affecting me&nbsp;
that's what my parents used to say now i'm the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:56.000
one smoking it's not about you i'm like no you're&nbsp;
influenced me by a second-hand smoke why is paul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.360
saying don't participate in darkness as believers&nbsp;
because somebody is being influenced by your walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.680
somebody's been influenced by your walk and you&nbsp;
may say but it's but it's only mine you know grace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.520
you know grace abounds and it's only between&nbsp;
me and the lord you know don't judge me and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.880
that's not what we're trying to do here that's not&nbsp;
what wall street paul's saying it's not valuable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:24.480
for you and it's not valuable for your purpose&nbsp;
your call as a christ father to live and that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.720
a challenging statement for you guys i want to&nbsp;
tell you this if i'm the only person accountable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.400
there's a likely chance that i won't wake up so&nbsp;
you used to i'm pretty good at working out every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.160
morning now with my alarm but even brittany knows&nbsp;
that person is way more sometimes than i should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.720
but when there's somebody waiting&nbsp;
for me at the gym i get up every time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.320
see this is the part when we understand this is&nbsp;
paul saying accountability don't walk in darkness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:52.480
not just for yourself but for others that are&nbsp;
watching you or others that are watching you and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.800
then he even goes on a little bit more he says&nbsp;
expose right so i mean that's a little bit of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.920
challenging statement what does it mean to expose&nbsp;
don't participate but expose so it doesn't mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.880
this don't go on social media and blast all over&nbsp;
social media that's joe bob and tag him has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.960
out at the bar it's too late right don't go do&nbsp;
that that's not what god's saying about exposing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.800
i don't even know who joe bob is and i don't&nbsp;
know if he's been at the bar once i'm sorry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.720
um i use joe bob a lot that's&nbsp;
just kind of a guy sorry joe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:32.720
i gotta come up with a different name sorry not&nbsp;
this okay see i keep getting lost i'm so sorry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:40.560
so here's really where he talks about exposing it&nbsp;
starts with you guys i'm telling you the church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:49.600
is known for their gossip and wanting to under&nbsp;
the you know what we're supposed to expose in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:55.360
talking about joe rog or now 10 somebody&nbsp;
whatever his name's going to be now in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:00.240
future we do it as though we're exposing we&nbsp;
need to tell everybody on facebook we need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.240
go tell everybody in our circles and expose him&nbsp;
that's not what he's talking about expose you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.720
it starts here stop trying to expose somebody&nbsp;
else's sins until you've exposed yours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:17.360
completely to the lord this is what paul's&nbsp;
saying don't walk in darkness expose them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.840
don't associate participate with them and as&nbsp;
you do you will be so humbled that when you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:30.640
somebody else walking in darkness you'll feel&nbsp;
so broken for them not judgmental broken that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:35.040
they're walking in it and you want them to be free&nbsp;
from it so you know what you do you come alongside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.120
them and you say hey i'm seeing something in&nbsp;
life that's not valuable let me tell you this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.600
i've struggled with some areas like that&nbsp;
before maybe it's not the exact same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.840
and here's how overcoming because i found there&nbsp;
wasn't value for me and i've got freedom and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:53.200
now i'm living with a purpose and i'm seeing life&nbsp;
change see we expose first ourselves then we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.880
the right heart to come alongside biblically&nbsp;
other people who are struggling the darkness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.960
is the way god's called us to do it&nbsp;
so james 5 19 through 21 says this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.680
my brothers and sisters if anyone among you&nbsp;
strays from the truth someone who turns him back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.520
and someone turns him back let that person&nbsp;
know that whoever turns the center from error&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:20.560
of his way will save his soul from death and get&nbsp;
to cover once to their sins so it is our role as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:26.320
believers to help people expose our sin right in&nbsp;
a way that is honoring coming alongside them right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:33.360
helping them restore them back to the faith so&nbsp;
many times if you miss that we miss that and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.840
he talks about it's even shameful to mention so&nbsp;
why is the question why is it shameful to mention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:41.360
this guy talking about all these impurities&nbsp;
right the more you talk about something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.880
the more you think about something the more you&nbsp;
desire something and you'll catch yourself sin so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:54.480
when he says don't even talk about or name these&nbsp;
things among you it's not valuable for you or the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.560
hearer because sometimes that will lead you to&nbsp;
sin and so this is the part where i've challenged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:04.560
you um if you haven't heard this challenge before&nbsp;
i hope you hear it today is we don't just say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:11.360
no to things we say yes to jesus so when we're&nbsp;
walking with someone who's dealing with darkness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.160
we don't sit there okay this is another great&nbsp;
example somebody's dealing with pornography issues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:20.080
right you're not going to sit there and keep&nbsp;
talking about those issues consistently right and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.920
all the ways that they know because why they're&nbsp;
should keep thinking about right what you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.000
going to do is spend more time talking about&nbsp;
how to renew your mind on god's truth and word&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.160
and the purity that he gives us through a right&nbsp;
relationship with him in a right relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.840
with those types of relationships right focus&nbsp;
on those things not on the impurity it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.560
valuable for them it's not valuable for you and&nbsp;
so here's the the challenge to you is you may&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.800
be thinking of this and this is the first thing&nbsp;
i've thought about well jesus sat with sinners&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.560
here's the interesting part jesus sat with sinners&nbsp;
and he was centered but he didn't send me centers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:59.920
that's right he was the greatest example yes you&nbsp;
know what honestly if you said have any dinner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.200
with me there's some people are gonna hang out&nbsp;
and do this next steps lunch you're going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.360
sitting in the center hopefully i'm not walking&nbsp;
in darkness i pray i'm not walking darkness right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.280
but we sit with other people&nbsp;
that are struggling in our walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.840
but we don't have to participate with what they're&nbsp;
struggling with and then that's soaking that's so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.560
key for us to know and it's not because you&nbsp;
don't get to or you may it's it's it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:28.320
beneficial for you it's not beneficial for them&nbsp;
so let's look at this last couple verses and i'm

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:35.520
serious challenged by this thought&nbsp;
is when light exposes darkness

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.200
there's sometimes a reason why&nbsp;
people don't walk in the church doors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.200
because when we're talking huge thing if you're&nbsp;
sitting in the seats today and you're hearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:49.280
god's word and you're you're struggling to&nbsp;
sit here because you just want to run i get it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.320
because light is being preached and talked&nbsp;
about today and it may be poking hole in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:59.760
darkness and you don't like it i've been there and&nbsp;
honestly i think i spend monday through sunday in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:05.120
daily work sometimes you look at the word and he's&nbsp;
that light is cleaning the darkness in my life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.360
so sometimes there's people that don't show&nbsp;
up to church because of that there's sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:16.160
where people basically won't even talk about&nbsp;
religious things with you because any time you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:23.280
shine the light of christ darwin says god so this&nbsp;
is just a reminder it's not easy when light hits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.880
darkness because sometimes we want to run and&nbsp;
sometimes other people want to learn from you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:34.000
but love people where they're at and don't be&nbsp;
afraid to do share that light with them but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.440
says this in verses 13 and 14 he says everything&nbsp;
exposed to the light is made invisible for what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.120
makes everything visible is what and that's such&nbsp;
a logical text if you don't understand that text&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:48.560
i love i love that right i seriously wrote that&nbsp;
text out and i'm like so how do i explain this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:53.280
it did it explained itself right&nbsp;
everything exposed to life is made visible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.360
that makes everything invisible's life that&nbsp;
i love text like that right so it makes sense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:04.000
when we expose darkness to light darkness in&nbsp;
our lives darkness in other people's lights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:10.640
it is made visible what they need to make return&nbsp;
from our penta so what should our response be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:18.400
today what should our response be verse 14 says&nbsp;
get upstairs and rise upon the dead and christ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.280
will shine on you again paul speaking directly&nbsp;
to believers if you're struggling with walking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.040
in darkness or talking about it or any of&nbsp;
things we've been dealing with maybe guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:33.280
just speaking to you today that you need to turn&nbsp;
from here's what paul's saying get up sleeper stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:39.680
stop walking as though you don't know what life&nbsp;
is experience it rise from the dead just like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:44.800
just like christ said quit living like you used to&nbsp;
dead in your sins right christ is ready to shine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.280
and i was challenged by this&nbsp;
statement as i was studying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.440
we you know we're supposed to shine our whites&nbsp;
and the first thing i think of is the sun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:54.240 --> 00:41:00.080
see we're not suns in the world that's actually&nbsp;
jesus we're a moon what's the moon dude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:08.160
it reflects the sun so we are only&nbsp;
light because we reflect jesus to others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:15.680
so what's your take away if you're believing&nbsp;
today you're walking with jesus um it's time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:21.600
start living inspired i i hope today's text is&nbsp;
challenging you to lean in and say lord use me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:28.640
like you've never used me before allow me to stop&nbsp;
walking darkness right no excuses no excuses it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.480
time to give your life fully to jesus and walk and&nbsp;
live because there's someone waiting for you right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.800
so how do we respond repentance this&nbsp;
is the thing repentance doesn't happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:42.720
just as salvation it happens every day god is&nbsp;
there every day is saying i'm ready and welcome&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.960
so there's multiple days i'm asking god to&nbsp;
forgive me and turn for my sins and to walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:53.840
in freedom here's my challenge to you&nbsp;
may believe that you can change the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.600
i made that statement the other day&nbsp;
to some teachers and administrators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.880
i said do you think you could change the world&nbsp;
and they kind of stared at me changed the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:08.160
i had a big task i said absolutely you could&nbsp;
change the world why how by living inspired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:17.600
if you do there's gonna be one person maybe two&nbsp;
maybe three that you could change their eternity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:24.160
where they spend their eternity either in heaven&nbsp;
wow yeah you can change the world with one person

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.680
maybe you don't know christ this is the last way&nbsp;
i want to kind of end today maybe you don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.720
christ maybe you're questioning what it is to have&nbsp;
a relationship with him and he here's the thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.240
if you're questioning that totally get it&nbsp;
in there it's been a year i spent a year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.040
questioning what it is in a relationship&nbsp;
with jesus and that's okay because you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:49.600
are questioning and that's what i'm here for i&nbsp;
want you to know that i want to talk with you i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:53.760
want to talk through what that means to follow&nbsp;
jesus i want to talk through how it is maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.000
you're struggling with darkness how to overcome&nbsp;
that and guess what my guide's gonna be like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.640
jesus it's not gonna be in ben's wisdom because i&nbsp;
don't got it it's got god's wisdom right i don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:11.360
got it but he does so your next step today&nbsp;
is important everybody has the next step&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.840
and i know we're going to do a next steps&nbsp;
lunch but if you're not going to that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:20.160
everybody has the next step today whether&nbsp;
you're a follower of jesus or not what are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:25.040
you trying to hide from god that god already&nbsp;
sees what darkness are you trying to hide from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.000
during our time of invitation i&nbsp;
challenge you to give that to god&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.840
expose it to god ask for&nbsp;
forgiveness and move from it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:39.280
if you don't know jesus maybe that's the darkness&nbsp;
maybe just the way you've been living maybe you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:43.040
don't even realize maybe the way you've been&nbsp;
living is darkness but you know you need jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:47.840
your response is to give your life to jesus and&nbsp;
here's what i've committed to during this time of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.640
worship um so we have something called invitation&nbsp;
and there's too many times i don't explain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:53.200 --> 00:44:01.040
why we do things invitation is an opportunity to&nbsp;
invite you into your next step to follow jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.440
again as a believer it could be repentance&nbsp;
to live inspire for an unbeliever somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:10.400
that doesn't know jesus it may just be to&nbsp;
have the next conversation or it's maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.240
to give your life to jesus and and i know it's&nbsp;
so difficult to do that because you're afraid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:19.360
so during this time i want you to spend some&nbsp;
time praying asking god to forgive you or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.720
to walk with you to reveal that but&nbsp;
i'm gonna stay in the back of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.520
because i want to invite anybody that needs to&nbsp;
be prayed for that has questions about salvation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.360
maybe you want to give your life to jesus i&nbsp;
want to be back here to talk to you because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:35.440
i know that sometimes it's difficult to come&nbsp;
forward right so it's okay to take a step back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:41.520
and talk with me um or to be prayed for whatever&nbsp;
you need i'm gonna be there to be able to walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:46.080
with you through that um and then just spend some&nbsp;
time worshiping the lord as we conclude with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:53.040
type of invitation so let's pray lord jesus thank&nbsp;
you again for who you are thank you for your word

00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:05.600
lord i pray today um lord i pray today&nbsp;
that um i know today there's someone in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.520
this room lord that is struggling with giving&nbsp;
up some darkness in their life lord that that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.560
they need to turn from and repent afterwards&nbsp;
so i just pray that they near this time of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:19.360
meditation lord that they open their hearts and&nbsp;
give it to you and they walk out of this room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:29.360
feeling free to live the life that you called them&nbsp;
to live or i i also in a room lord with people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.640
that i have no clue where the relationship with&nbsp;
you lord i know there's somebody that's wrestling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:38.000
or whether they should give their lives to you&nbsp;
lord whether they have or having questions lord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.720
i pray that today they don't wait a year like i&nbsp;
waited lord that they go and they ask questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:47.520
they go and they ask for prayer where they go&nbsp;
and they say hey i need to give my life to jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:55.040
lord we're praying for life change because you've&nbsp;
changed our lives we believe in the power of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:55.040 --> 00:46:00.480
salvation we believe in what you are doing in this&nbsp;
church we believe in what you're doing in our city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:05.440
we believe in what you're doing in each one of&nbsp;
our individual lives lord and so we trust you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:11.920
in the days as we go forward lord with&nbsp;
everything all the details lord may we walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:25.040
in truth and in goodness and in righteousness&nbsp;
or may we go live inspired we pray amen
