00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.610
Alright, we'll uh, go ahead and take
some time to jump into the word today.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.930
Question, is anybody in here that
wasn't here last week that wants to

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.990
help in the, uh, PaulFest that we're
doing Tuesday, Sept or, September 19th?

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.050
Is anybody in here that didn't
sign up that wants to sign up?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.180
Because I think there's a lot of people
in here that already signed up last week.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.239
Basically, I want to encourage you, if you
haven't signed up to help September 19th,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.030
I'm gonna have this at the end of service.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.470
To be able to sign up, because we're
trying to get as many people as possible.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.780
Um, because we probably need another
5 or 10 volunteers to make sure that

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.690
we can run that, um, event well.

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:45.470
So we're super excited to do it.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.360
We've been getting a lot
of the details together.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.459
We'll be communicating more of that this
week to those of you that will be serving.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.220
Um, so, anyways, if you're
interested in helping in that, I'm

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.440
gonna make sure we get that, uh,
signed up at the end of service.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.099
Uh, but we are continuing
our series in Genesis.

00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:05.985
Um, today we're going to be in Genesis
chapter 2 and the first 3 verses, uh, but

00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:12.035
we covered all of Genesis 1 last week and
I kind of explained it this way whenever

00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:18.115
we walked through a lot of verses and a
lot of content in a short amount of time.

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:22.635
I kind of communicated it this way,
number one, um, not able to communicate

00:01:22.635 --> 00:01:27.015
and cover every single verse, verse by
verse, and talk through every detail.

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:31.645
Um, and my encouragement for you is
if you're interested in anything from

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:35.235
chapter one of Genesis that you, like,
ah, I'd love to know more about it.

00:01:35.265 --> 00:01:37.655
Um, my encouragement is one,
go study it on your own.

00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:40.544
Um, the Bible Project has
some great resources to study

00:01:40.544 --> 00:01:42.195
Genesis even deeper, deeper.

00:01:42.494 --> 00:01:43.845
Um, and so that's one way to do it.

00:01:44.174 --> 00:01:47.524
Um, but our goal with going
through the book of Genesis is

00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:50.875
looking at more transformation
rather than just information.

00:01:51.085 --> 00:01:54.545
Here, here's what I would say with
this is most Old Testament books of the

00:01:54.545 --> 00:01:56.315
Bible, you can go really, really deep.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.539
And you can get a lot of
information, which, what I

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:01.630
would say, may float your boat.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.870
Like, that may be exciting to you, and
that may be good for you spiritually,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.449
and I challenge you to go do that.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.270
But ultimately, like, we can't do all
that deep dive in here, uh, practically,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.789
uh, and, and keep moving through it.

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:15.300
So I wanted to make sure that
we focused more on that idea of

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.770
transformation rather than information.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.590
Although, we're still
covering a lot of information.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.050
And then today, you're going to kind
of laugh because we covered one whole

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.620
chapter last week, and we're going
to cover three whole verses today.

00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:28.255
Uh, but we've stopped today to cover
these verses because they're important.

00:02:28.745 --> 00:02:31.895
Uh, but kind of speaking of the first
six days of creation, I kind of want

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:34.295
to share this, uh, funny little story.

00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:37.174
I don't know if you guys have
ever heard of the story about

00:02:37.184 --> 00:02:41.534
a management consultant, a,
uh, gardener, and a politician.

00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:43.885
They were sitting in a pub one
day, and they began to talk about

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:45.555
who has the greatest profession.

00:02:46.035 --> 00:02:48.545
And they decided to use the Bible
as kind of the reasoning why

00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:49.695
they had the greatest profession.

00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:54.330
And so, the gardener goes and says,
Well, in Genesis 3, God created

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.730
plants, so gardening must be the
greatest profession out there.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.530
Well, the management consultant basically
said, well, in Genesis, basically the

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.770
first couple of verses, uh, in the first
day, he created, um, order out of chaos.

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:13.230
He said, so management must
be the greatest profession.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.640
And the politician said, wait,
but who created the chaos?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.169
So the politician must be the greatest.

00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:22.535
Uh, obviously, in that.

00:03:22.555 --> 00:03:25.365
So, we didn't talk specifically about
that, but I thought that was funny

00:03:25.365 --> 00:03:28.845
when I began to study a little bit
more about this idea behind creation.

00:03:28.845 --> 00:03:30.455
What's the greatest day of creation?

00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:34.365
And last week, I think we actually
decided that the greatest day of

00:03:34.365 --> 00:03:36.025
creation is all of them, right?

00:03:36.205 --> 00:03:39.024
But ultimately, we are
God's greatest creation.

00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:43.935
And, uh, we learned this, number
one, who created us, right?

00:03:43.935 --> 00:03:47.305
We learned last week who created
us and the world that we live in.

00:03:47.305 --> 00:03:48.515
And ultimately, that was God.

00:03:49.165 --> 00:03:50.665
Nobody else other than God.

00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:54.025
Uh, and then two, we learned
what we were created for.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:54.325
Right?

00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:57.175
To be image bearers of God to the world.

00:03:57.285 --> 00:03:57.565
Right?

00:03:57.575 --> 00:04:02.365
To reflect His spiritual nature
and character to those around us.

00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:04.645
And I hope that was to take home for you.

00:04:04.984 --> 00:04:07.915
And we're going to kind of
build off that again today.

00:04:08.984 --> 00:04:12.115
And I really asked this question at
the end of the message last week.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:17.594
With this idea of, if we know
that we were created by God.

00:04:17.904 --> 00:04:20.695
And we were created to
reflect God's character.

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:25.984
Is that enough to motivate
us the rest of our lives in

00:04:25.984 --> 00:04:27.715
sharing who He is with others?

00:04:27.994 --> 00:04:29.655
In reflecting God to others?

00:04:29.664 --> 00:04:33.974
And my hope is that is true for
you as much as it should be true

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:36.414
for any follower of Jesus if
you've given your life to Christ.

00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:38.885
But today we get to talk
about day seven, right?

00:04:38.885 --> 00:04:40.575
So we talked about six days all last week.

00:04:40.575 --> 00:04:42.305
We're gonna talk about one day.

00:04:42.305 --> 00:04:45.064
And this day stands alone by
itself and that's why I think it...

00:04:45.445 --> 00:04:50.155
Um, is important for us to discuss
this day as a stand alone message.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.045
And we're going to talk
about the idea of rest.

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:54.045
We'll talk about three
things in the idea of rest.

00:04:54.045 --> 00:04:56.725
Number one, we're actually going
to talk about the purpose of the

00:04:56.725 --> 00:04:58.724
Seventh day rest, um, in creation.

00:04:58.725 --> 00:05:01.384
So what we're going to do is we're going
to kind of just dive specifically into

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:05.225
that Seventh day, those three verses,
and say, what is God saying there?

00:05:06.495 --> 00:05:09.495
And then we're going to say, okay,
but what does that mean in the grand

00:05:09.495 --> 00:05:12.975
picture of the Bible and in our lives?

00:05:13.495 --> 00:05:16.305
Um, so we're going to kind of look at
that and Elona in itself, and then we're

00:05:16.305 --> 00:05:21.265
going to move to when we first see,
um, the seventh day or the Sabbath rest

00:05:21.295 --> 00:05:25.675
really talked about more, and that's
in Exodus 16 with the people of Israel,

00:05:25.675 --> 00:05:26.454
and we'll kind of talk about that.

00:05:26.455 --> 00:05:28.385
So that's going to be the second
thing that we talk about and how

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:32.975
that was implemented into their life
as a rhythm of rest once a week.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:36.805
Uh, and then we're going to say and answer
hopefully this last question, which I

00:05:36.855 --> 00:05:41.795
think many of us may wonder, is it a
command for us to take a Sabbath rest?

00:05:42.155 --> 00:05:43.304
Now, right?

00:05:43.335 --> 00:05:46.364
So, we read the Bible, and we read the Old
Testament, and sometimes what we say about

00:05:46.405 --> 00:05:50.145
the Old Testament, well, the Old Testament
law was fulfilled in Jesus Christ, so

00:05:50.155 --> 00:05:51.994
the Old Testament is not valuable for us.

00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:53.754
Well, that's not true.

00:05:54.314 --> 00:05:56.594
It is true that He did fulfill the law.

00:05:56.614 --> 00:05:58.574
It is not true that it's
not valuable for us.

00:05:58.574 --> 00:05:59.894
It is very valuable for us.

00:06:00.224 --> 00:06:02.454
But what we're really going to
understand this idea of is that

00:06:02.494 --> 00:06:03.894
something that should be important.

00:06:04.164 --> 00:06:05.504
To take rest.

00:06:05.784 --> 00:06:06.974
And what is rest?

00:06:06.974 --> 00:06:11.304
And I think that we'll kind of build
this case today that the initial rest,

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:18.289
The rest that God had on the seventh day
is ultimately what he has been trying to

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.049
provide for us ever since the fall of man.

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.619
And he fulfilled that, and he
provided that through Jesus.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.619
And that's the culmination,
really, of this message.

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:28.549
So you guys may not need anything
else after you've heard all that.

00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:29.289
You're probably good.

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.320
Um, but let's dive into this text.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.090
Genesis chapter 2.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.809
We're just gonna read
the first three verses.

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:37.369
We're gonna add a ton of other
verses in to kind of help build

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:38.759
out the idea behind rest later.

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.069
But we're gonna start with
these first three verses.

00:06:40.245 --> 00:06:41.625
verses here in Genesis chapter 2.

00:06:41.645 --> 00:06:45.835
So it says this, So the heavens
and the earth and everything

00:06:45.844 --> 00:06:47.594
in them were completed.

00:06:48.155 --> 00:06:52.364
And on the seventh day, God had
completed his work that he had done,

00:06:52.655 --> 00:06:56.704
and he rested on the seventh day from
all of his work that he had done.

00:06:57.234 --> 00:07:01.635
God blessed the seventh day and
declared it holy, for on it he rested

00:07:01.635 --> 00:07:03.635
from all the work of his creation.

00:07:03.815 --> 00:07:04.335
So let's pray.

00:07:04.344 --> 00:07:08.094
Lord Jesus, we pray that through your word
and through today's message, Lord, that

00:07:08.114 --> 00:07:09.674
each one of us will take something home.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.110
Lord, to be transformed and
changed, to be able to understand

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.830
you more and Lord, to understand
really what rest truly is in you.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.639
And so Lord, we just pray this
in your heavenly name, Amen.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.100
Let me get a question for you.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.570
How many people in here
need some more rest?

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:26.160
Anybody?

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:27.439
Okay.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.690
We live in a society that it
seems like the majority of

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.100
us want more time, more rest.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.020
We seem to be tired more and it seems
like we're never going to accomplish.

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:41.030
All the things that we have to do in life.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.560
Um, and the reason why that is is because
it seems like that there's something

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.280
deep down inside of us that we have
to do more and more and more, and I

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.260
believe that we'll learn a little bit
about the idea behind rest, and how we

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.700
can receive that in the midst of that.

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:57.200
Um, but we're gonna talk
specifically about the actual

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.650
purpose of the seventh day of rest
here in these first three verses.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.590
And just right off the bat, one
of the things, I, I wanna, I

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.120
wanna look at this in its setting.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.560
Nowhere in these three verses does
it say, man should do these things.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.030
This is just speaking of God Himself.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.560
And I think that's so important
when we study the word of God a lot

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.500
of times we quickly want to jump
to, how does this apply to my life?

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.989
And I think we want to really look at,
how did this apply to God in that time?

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.029
And so nowhere did it specifically
talk about man and what he should do in

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.290
regards to rest in these three verses.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.320
But what I would say is, although,
as followers of Jesus, we should

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.560
pattern ourselves after God, and I
think we should look at this as well.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:41.460
Um, But one of the things we, we
see here is We, we don't see, uh,

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.110
God resting because He's tired.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.110
I think that's probably the question.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.920
I mean, was God so tired
for six days of creation?

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.829
He was just drenched with sweat
and He was so exhausted, He needed

00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:52.460
to just collapse for a full day.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.620
Anybody had to do that before?

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.910
Like, work six hard days and you
just need to collapse for a day?

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:56.940
See, that wasn't God.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.020
God wasn't tired.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:03.250
And what we see here is in Isaiah 40, 28,
it says this, The Lord is the everlasting

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.740
God, the creator of the ends of the earth.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.030
He will not grow tired or weary.

00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:10.605
And it's understanding no one can fathom.

00:09:10.615 --> 00:09:14.395
So we understand this idea is that God
wasn't tired, that wasn't why he rested.

00:09:14.975 --> 00:09:19.905
Um, but he really used this day as
a way to set it apart, because all

00:09:19.915 --> 00:09:22.345
the work he had done was finished.

00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:26.244
He was completed with his work and he
was pleased and he was satisfied with it.

00:09:26.424 --> 00:09:30.215
One of the things I think that's
so cool, is it took the culmination

00:09:30.215 --> 00:09:33.375
of six days to come to the point of
creating his greatest creation, us.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.710
And he said, it is good.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.940
And he said it's very good
when he looked at his creation

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.250
and he really looked at us.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.129
And he was satisfied enough
to rest knowing that we, his

00:09:45.129 --> 00:09:47.109
greatest creation, was enough.

00:09:47.129 --> 00:09:48.430
That it was good.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.159
And so there's three things that
are distinctive about this seventh

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:52.320
day that we'll see in here.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:56.460
Number one, you'll mention from last
week if you think about it, uh, at

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.170
the six days, at the end of every
day, let's say it was evening and

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.109
then it was morning and then it was
the first day or the second day.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:03.690
Right?

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.870
It would say those things every time.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.670
But we don't see that
statement in the seventh day.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.670
We don't see there was
evening and there was morning.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.540
And I started really thinking about,
why don't we see on the seventh day

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.930
that there was an evening and a morning?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.190
And many believers, when we get to
study this, is the reason why God

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.430
didn't say that is that the rest that
God was resting from, like He was

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:28.080
resting from all of His work, was
something that He was going to live in

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.440
and experience the rest of creation.

00:10:30.955 --> 00:10:36.355
That he wanted his creation to
rest in him, to rest in what was

00:10:36.375 --> 00:10:41.255
already created, to experience the
blessing of what was already there.

00:10:41.255 --> 00:10:43.344
So there was never a need for another day.

00:10:43.735 --> 00:10:45.445
This was the day to live in.

00:10:45.445 --> 00:10:48.455
And I think that's really cool
when we begin to think about that

00:10:48.455 --> 00:10:52.265
idea that this day of rest would
have been something that would have

00:10:52.315 --> 00:10:54.795
continued on and on and on and on.

00:10:54.905 --> 00:10:58.045
I believe that was the goal
of God in the beginning.

00:10:58.844 --> 00:11:03.624
And I believe that's the goal of God in
the future, an eternal rest with God.

00:11:03.894 --> 00:11:06.324
Um, but what we found is after the
fall, and again we're not going to get

00:11:06.324 --> 00:11:10.114
into the details of this, but after the
fall of man, that rest was taken away.

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:14.224
Um, and God has been pursuing us to
be able to give us that rest again.

00:11:14.764 --> 00:11:17.124
So the other thing that we'll see that
was distinctive about the seventh day

00:11:17.124 --> 00:11:19.484
is that God blessed the seventh day.

00:11:19.484 --> 00:11:20.834
You'll see that in verse three.

00:11:20.834 --> 00:11:21.924
God blessed the seventh day.

00:11:21.924 --> 00:11:25.714
Now, we talked last week that
God blessed animals, right?

00:11:25.714 --> 00:11:27.254
He blessed humans to do what?

00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:27.774
Does anybody remember?

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.290
To be fruitful and multiply.

00:11:31.889 --> 00:11:34.810
So he was, he wanted to bless, uh,
see if he wanted to bless animals

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:35.660
to be fruitful and multiply.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.910
He had multiple kids, and
I even referenced this.

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:41.160
I believe he wanted this to be fruitful
and multiply spiritually as well.

00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:44.150
But one of the things we didn't
see is God never blessed a specific

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.969
day, but he blessed this day.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.420
When we think about a blessing,
it's something special.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.479
It's something to remember.

00:11:51.499 --> 00:11:53.239
It's something to experience.

00:11:53.239 --> 00:11:55.009
I don't know about you guys, but if
somebody says, I want to give you a

00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:57.049
blessing, I fully want to experience that.

00:11:57.199 --> 00:11:57.520
Blessing.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.630
Okay, so I look at this and saying God
wants us to experience this blessing.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.130
He wants us to experience
it forever, right?

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.140
This day of rest.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.709
And then the last thing that
we see here is that God made

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:10.780
the day holy or set apart.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.660
You see that again at the end of verse
three, that it was holy and on it

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.630
he rested from the work of creation.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.449
And so when we think about the idea
of holy, this work holy set apart is

00:12:22.469 --> 00:12:24.579
it's one that needs to be remembered.

00:12:24.599 --> 00:12:27.870
It's it's set apart for a special purpose.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.870
It's something for us to remember.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:35.880
So when we think about this, the actual
purpose of the seventh day for God was to

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:42.660
cease from the work that he had done, to
rest from it and to remember his creation,

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:48.660
to celebrate and bask in the magnitude of
his creation and to enjoy his creation.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.380
I believe that was God's goal
on the seventh day, and I

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.120
believe God created that day.

00:12:55.155 --> 00:12:59.165
And the six days before for
us to experience that from the

00:12:59.165 --> 00:13:02.645
time that we were created until
the time of eternity, honestly.

00:13:03.084 --> 00:13:05.265
And so we look at this day as a huge day.

00:13:05.265 --> 00:13:06.314
And so this is a question.

00:13:06.314 --> 00:13:09.894
I'm going to have some questions to
just pose to you to process through

00:13:09.915 --> 00:13:12.724
at the end of each kind of idea
that we're walking through here.

00:13:12.724 --> 00:13:14.405
Number one, this is the first one.

00:13:14.425 --> 00:13:18.415
As image bearers of Christ, or as
image bearers of God, which we had

00:13:18.415 --> 00:13:23.324
learned last week, that's what we are,
do we reflect God's spiritual nature?

00:13:24.884 --> 00:13:26.675
Do we reflect God's spiritual nature
of resting and ceasing from work

00:13:26.685 --> 00:13:30.894
on a regular basis to celebrate,
worship, and enjoy His creation?

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:31.614
I'll say this again.

00:13:31.994 --> 00:13:36.364
Do we reflect God's spiritual nature
of resting and ceasing from work

00:13:36.394 --> 00:13:40.444
on a regular basis to celebrate,
worship, and enjoy His creation?

00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:45.224
Do we model after God, if it was good
enough for God to rest, and bask in the

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:48.925
glory of creation, and to celebrate,
and set it apart, and make it a special

00:13:48.925 --> 00:13:50.435
day, and to experience the blessing?

00:13:51.105 --> 00:13:53.535
Do we experience that blessing today?

00:13:54.085 --> 00:13:56.415
That's a really challenging
statement because most of you would

00:13:56.415 --> 00:13:58.425
be like, I don't got time to rest.

00:13:58.425 --> 00:14:00.185
I have nine kids running around.

00:14:00.384 --> 00:14:02.365
I have six jobs that I'm doing.

00:14:02.395 --> 00:14:04.434
I have this, this, this, and this.

00:14:04.695 --> 00:14:06.815
Okay, most of us maybe
don't experience that.

00:14:06.884 --> 00:14:10.064
My challenge today as we go through
this is that you do find a way to

00:14:10.065 --> 00:14:13.045
experience that because it is a
blessing that God has given us.

00:14:13.585 --> 00:14:16.285
So, the first thing, right, was
trying to understand just in these

00:14:16.295 --> 00:14:18.155
three verses, What was God saying?

00:14:18.165 --> 00:14:18.885
What did it mean here?

00:14:18.885 --> 00:14:20.204
But God didn't stop there.

00:14:20.204 --> 00:14:22.535
One of the reasons God didn't stop
there is He kind of built on the seventh

00:14:22.574 --> 00:14:24.285
day of rest in the book of Exodus.

00:14:24.295 --> 00:14:27.204
So we have Genesis that we're
going to cover over, you know,

00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:29.054
hopefully a couple of years.

00:14:29.064 --> 00:14:31.875
The next book is Exodus.

00:14:32.314 --> 00:14:33.944
Exodus is all about Moses.

00:14:33.944 --> 00:14:38.045
Most of us would probably know Moses, but
if you don't, Moses ended up helping lead

00:14:38.064 --> 00:14:43.064
the people of Israel, God's people, the
special people, set apart out of slavery.

00:14:43.524 --> 00:14:45.564
They were put into slavery for 400 years.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.590
Moses led them up out of Egypt, and
if you remember, he split the waters,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.720
they crossed over, and they were
heading to the Promised Land, and

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:57.319
on their way to the Promised Land,
God began to set something in place.

00:14:57.319 --> 00:15:01.629
And so we want to see where God begins
to bring back up, for the first time

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:05.900
since the seventh day, He begins
to bring back up this idea of rest.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.520
Rest on the seventh day.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.120
And so how is the Sabbath rest
implemented in the life of the people

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.199
of God, or the people of Israel?

00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:15.589
And so we're gonna kind of look at
this and I think in order to understand

00:15:15.589 --> 00:15:20.270
Genesis two verses one through
three, we need to look and see how

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.319
it was continued to be spoke about
throughout the rest of the Bible.

00:15:24.319 --> 00:15:28.459
And so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna be in Exodus 16 verses 22 and 23.

00:15:28.459 --> 00:15:32.060
So if you want to turn there, you
can Exodus 16 verses 22 through 23.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.810
Then we're also gonna cover 1629 as well.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.609
Uh, and we're gonna have
those verses up behind us.

00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:42.839
But in Exodus 16, here's what, um,
is said to the people of Israel.

00:15:42.869 --> 00:15:48.939
On the sixth day, they gathered twice
as much food, four quarts apiece.

00:15:48.979 --> 00:15:51.999
And the leaders of the community
came and reported this to Moses.

00:15:52.249 --> 00:15:54.859
And he told them, this is
what the Lord has said.

00:15:55.469 --> 00:15:57.789
Tomorrow is a day of complete rest.

00:15:58.239 --> 00:16:00.579
A holy Sabbath to the Lord.

00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:03.800
Bake what you want to bake and
boil what you want to boil.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.519
And set aside everything left
over to be kept until morning.

00:16:07.215 --> 00:16:10.955
And then we see in Exodus 16, 29, it
says this, it says, Understand that

00:16:10.975 --> 00:16:13.165
the Lord has given you the Sabbath.

00:16:13.645 --> 00:16:17.075
Therefore, on the sixth day, he has
given you two days worth of bread.

00:16:17.465 --> 00:16:19.045
Each of you stay where you are.

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:21.605
No one is to leave his
place on the seventh day.

00:16:22.425 --> 00:16:26.034
So there's so much more to this story that
I don't have time to unpack, but I want

00:16:26.035 --> 00:16:29.585
to kind of bring out two points from the
idea of the first time we see anything

00:16:29.585 --> 00:16:33.045
about rest, from creation was the seventh
day of rest, this is the first time

00:16:33.045 --> 00:16:35.265
we begin to see this really practiced.

00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:41.180
This the Bible again, and we
would see that God would implement

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.930
this for the people of Israel on
their way to the promised land.

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:48.779
Does anybody know that there was a lot of
walking involved and a lot of travel and

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:52.560
a lot of work to move that many people
all the way over to the promised land?

00:16:53.499 --> 00:16:58.279
So when we think about this, I think
it was a blessing, think about it, a

00:16:58.279 --> 00:17:02.469
blessing that God was providing for the
people of Israel because he knew that

00:17:02.469 --> 00:17:04.039
they would be exhausted trying to do this.

00:17:04.385 --> 00:17:07.694
It's seven days a week, you know,
constantly, constantly moving.

00:17:08.105 --> 00:17:12.495
So, when we think about the original
purpose of creation was a blessing, God

00:17:12.495 --> 00:17:17.285
implemented this as a blessing to the
people of Israel on their travels, right?

00:17:17.614 --> 00:17:19.454
So it was a benefit for them, right?

00:17:19.475 --> 00:17:22.355
It wasn't a burden to take this rest.

00:17:22.385 --> 00:17:24.055
It was a benefit given to them.

00:17:24.055 --> 00:17:26.395
And so that's the first thing that
we see here when we look at this.

00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:28.415
He says, tomorrow will be
a day of complete rest.

00:17:28.415 --> 00:17:32.284
Obviously set up to the Lord, but
he says he's given it to them.

00:17:32.645 --> 00:17:34.425
It was a gift given to them.

00:17:34.805 --> 00:17:38.975
And I think when we think about this
as ourselves, most of society would

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:42.595
say, if you want to get further
in life, you need to work harder.

00:17:43.305 --> 00:17:44.674
You need to work harder.

00:17:45.075 --> 00:17:48.595
And in God's economy,
sometimes we need to work less.

00:17:49.075 --> 00:17:51.554
Because in working less, and that's
going to sound weird, because you're

00:17:51.554 --> 00:17:54.775
going to go to your boss and say, well,
my pastor said I need to work less.

00:17:54.775 --> 00:17:55.375
I need some more time off.

00:17:56.245 --> 00:17:57.715
And if you get fired,
don't blame the pastor.

00:17:58.305 --> 00:17:58.555
Okay.

00:17:58.945 --> 00:17:59.685
Bring it to the Lord.

00:18:00.555 --> 00:18:04.285
And when we think about this, that
rest is actually resting in the

00:18:04.325 --> 00:18:06.455
Lord to provide what you need.

00:18:08.065 --> 00:18:10.805
The Lord actually provided on the
sixth day for the people of Israel

00:18:11.135 --> 00:18:13.095
everything they needed to take the rest.

00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:17.685
And most of us, including myself at
times, struggles to believe on the sixth

00:18:17.685 --> 00:18:22.985
day that God will provide enough on the
sixth day to rest on the seventh day.

00:18:22.985 --> 00:18:26.165
That's, that's a little bit convicting
when it comes to faith, right?

00:18:26.925 --> 00:18:30.264
And so when we think about this
rest that He gave the people of

00:18:30.334 --> 00:18:33.814
Israel on their journey, He already
provided the food, but this would

00:18:33.814 --> 00:18:35.375
allow them to do a couple things.

00:18:35.574 --> 00:18:39.014
It would allow them to experience
the rest that God had originally

00:18:39.014 --> 00:18:40.294
designed for them on the seventh day.

00:18:40.294 --> 00:18:44.874
If you think about it, the seventh
day rest was given, and Adam and

00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:46.675
Eve got to experience that rest.

00:18:47.014 --> 00:18:50.875
But when sin came into the
world, that rest was taken away.

00:18:51.225 --> 00:18:55.054
And so God set apart this day for them
to begin to experience a taste of.

00:18:57.479 --> 00:19:00.840
This is a cool picture to think that
God would set apart this day for

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.280
them to begin to experience, right
there in that day, all the things

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.569
that He had originally designed.

00:19:07.119 --> 00:19:09.979
So the next thing that we see, this
is that the Sabbath was created,

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.419
uh, as holy unto the Lord, set
apart to remember a few things.

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:19.840
If you remember, go back to creation,
seventh day, it was set apart as holy.

00:19:20.129 --> 00:19:23.550
So these all line up, that the
same purpose that God gave them the

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.019
Sabbath day, the Sabbath day rest.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.980
It's the same reason why he
rested on the seventh day.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.700
So we see it was something
to be continued on, right?

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:32.920
So he set it apart for a few things.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.170
Number one is to worship, right?

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.270
We already kind of talked about that.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.109
But to worship the Lord, who is the
creator and provider of everything.

00:19:39.139 --> 00:19:40.300
It would give them time.

00:19:40.529 --> 00:19:44.300
Rather than working to go find their
food and to travel, they could rest

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.900
and eat the food that was provided by
them, by God, and worship and thank Him.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.330
Do you think that's valuable
to do even in our own lives?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.789
Dude, do we really truly take time?

00:19:55.205 --> 00:19:56.145
I mean, I'll tell you this.

00:19:56.675 --> 00:19:58.795
Usually, I used to be this person.

00:19:58.795 --> 00:19:59.755
Like, I loved to eat out.

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:01.045
Now, I love to eat in.

00:20:01.445 --> 00:20:03.445
And Brittany cooks some
of the most amazing meals.

00:20:03.905 --> 00:20:05.215
She's in here, so I can say that today.

00:20:05.655 --> 00:20:08.355
She cooks some of the most amazing
meals, and I love to eat in.

00:20:08.895 --> 00:20:11.234
And a lot of times we pray before
meals, and a lot of times we're like,

00:20:11.234 --> 00:20:12.424
Lord, thank you so much for this food.

00:20:12.425 --> 00:20:16.455
But, honestly, sometimes I wonder,
like, I'm wanting my kids to hurry

00:20:16.455 --> 00:20:18.464
up and pray because I'm so hungry.

00:20:18.465 --> 00:20:21.385
I'm truly not worshiping the
Lord and saying thank you.

00:20:21.695 --> 00:20:25.145
For allowing me to have the job that
I have, and the wife that I have, and

00:20:25.145 --> 00:20:28.465
the ingredients that we have, because
the craziest thing, y'all, we thought,

00:20:28.504 --> 00:20:29.334
we talked about this last week.

00:20:29.784 --> 00:20:34.225
Every single thing that it took to
make that food came from creation.

00:20:35.615 --> 00:20:37.365
We learned last week that
everything that comes from

00:20:37.365 --> 00:20:39.745
creation is from the creator, God.

00:20:41.034 --> 00:20:44.084
And we quickly, say that quick prayer so
that we can eat the food so that we can

00:20:44.084 --> 00:20:46.324
go watch the Bengals game, because we
know the Bengals game is coming up, right?

00:20:46.504 --> 00:20:47.635
And I'm not against any of that.

00:20:47.975 --> 00:20:51.185
But do we really truly take time,
just like they, God had given them

00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:54.514
time, to worship and thank God for
everything that they had, right?

00:20:54.885 --> 00:20:59.135
And, again, there's more that I can't
talk about in this text, but God gave

00:20:59.135 --> 00:21:02.864
them this day, He provided double the
amount of food the day before, and the

00:21:02.865 --> 00:21:04.305
next day, you know what many of them did?

00:21:04.925 --> 00:21:07.135
They were out wandering,
looking for more food.

00:21:08.285 --> 00:21:09.385
And they were like, where's the food?

00:21:09.385 --> 00:21:12.465
And God's like, but I told you,
on the sixth day I would provide

00:21:12.465 --> 00:21:13.745
enough for you to take rest.

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:16.579
And they were still trying to work.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.610
They were still trying to do
it on their own, and they were

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:20.830
missing out on the blessing.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.950
Man, does that sound familiar to anybody?

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.909
Because sometimes we're missing
out on the blessing of the rest

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.570
that God gives to us, right?

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:31.819
So the second thing we learn here,
right, that He set apart this day,

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.509
holy unto the Lord, is to remind them
of God's perfect rest at creation.

00:21:36.509 --> 00:21:37.449
So think about this.

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:40.240
It not only allows us to thank God
for what we have, but it allows

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.090
us to go back to creation and
think, Wow, God created everything,

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:46.160
and He created this day as well.

00:21:46.475 --> 00:21:49.325
Specially, special and holy unto the Lord.

00:21:49.595 --> 00:21:50.945
A blessing to my life.

00:21:50.945 --> 00:21:54.105
So it allowed them to remember creation.

00:21:54.115 --> 00:21:56.375
Allowed them to remind
them of their creator.

00:21:56.965 --> 00:21:58.705
And the purpose of that day of rest.

00:21:59.135 --> 00:22:00.895
And to really reflect on them.

00:22:00.974 --> 00:22:02.705
Right, so that's another thing
that it allowed them to do.

00:22:02.705 --> 00:22:05.205
The last one, which I
think is so important.

00:22:05.515 --> 00:22:07.525
It repentance.

00:22:08.525 --> 00:22:10.965
Because in the day of rest, does
anybody ever catch themselves when

00:22:10.965 --> 00:22:12.805
you actually rest and reflect?

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.880
You begin to see cracks in your
life, but when you're going, you

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.210
kind of just ignore the cracks.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:20.400
Maybe that's just me.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:22.300
So I'll just be the example.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:26.940
Whenever I stop and I actually
reflect, conviction comes in my life

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.289
because I see the cracks in my life.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.069
And I see the areas where I'm not
experiencing the blessing of God.

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:35.259
And it allowed them, and it
allows us time to repent.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.480
Repentance isn't a bad thing.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.810
It's actually a wonderful thing
because it allows you to turn from

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.150
that which is not valuable for you.

00:22:41.545 --> 00:22:44.855
and experience what's best
for you from God, right?

00:22:44.885 --> 00:22:47.445
So those three things
were given to them, right?

00:22:47.535 --> 00:22:52.725
And we eventually see in Exodus 20,
where God even adds the Sabbath rest as a

00:22:52.725 --> 00:22:55.674
commandment in the Ten Commandments, right
in the middle of the Ten Commandments.

00:22:56.105 --> 00:22:58.835
Um, and so it's interesting that
He even put it there because

00:22:59.084 --> 00:23:00.924
He wanted it to be a blessing.

00:23:00.924 --> 00:23:04.525
And what we'll later learn, what we're
getting ready to talk about, is that

00:23:04.535 --> 00:23:10.890
the Sabbath to the Israelites and then
Jews at that time, It wasn't a blessing.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.210
It became a burden.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:16.320
So here's my challenging question
for you after kind of hearing when

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.099
God began to implement the Sabbath
rest for the Israelites, is this.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:26.100
Is as an image bearer of God to the
world, if God saw it important for

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.010
the people of Israel to take a Sabbath
rest, to remember these things, right?

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.450
Do you think it's important for
us to experience a Sabbath rest?

00:23:35.629 --> 00:23:38.520
I hope all these you guys are going
to say yes and amen rather than no.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:39.270
I disagree.

00:23:39.905 --> 00:23:44.405
I would say that if we see God provided
this as a blessing to the Israelites,

00:23:44.405 --> 00:23:45.565
do you want to receive that blessing?

00:23:46.195 --> 00:23:46.455
Yes.

00:23:48.155 --> 00:23:52.384
Can I tell you, I want to receive
that blessing, but even I struggle

00:23:52.865 --> 00:23:53.995
with the experience of that blessing.

00:23:54.425 --> 00:23:56.434
So if you're wondering, like, man,
pastor's really getting on me.

00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:58.814
No, pastor's looking in the mirror and
going, man, I'm really getting on you.

00:23:59.265 --> 00:24:04.105
Like, this is hard to comprehend, but
this is why God has given us His word.

00:24:04.535 --> 00:24:06.435
It's why His word does not return void.

00:24:06.865 --> 00:24:11.315
That's why it is sharper than a
double edged sword, that splits

00:24:11.325 --> 00:24:16.575
the hairs of our heart, and it
convicts us not to make us feel bad.

00:24:16.985 --> 00:24:20.305
It convicts us to want to
experience better than what we have.

00:24:21.155 --> 00:24:23.004
So let's see the last statement, right?

00:24:23.005 --> 00:24:25.274
We obviously, now we learned
what was first implemented,

00:24:25.274 --> 00:24:26.814
right, with the Israelites.

00:24:27.234 --> 00:24:29.845
But now the question is,
that was Old Testament times.

00:24:30.065 --> 00:24:31.045
That was creation times.

00:24:31.045 --> 00:24:31.945
That was God.

00:24:32.025 --> 00:24:35.445
Why do we still have
to take a Sabbath rest?

00:24:35.485 --> 00:24:36.635
Is it a command?

00:24:36.645 --> 00:24:39.415
Is it still a command
to take a Sabbath rest?

00:24:40.364 --> 00:24:42.695
I think you're going to be
interested in what answer I give you.

00:24:42.715 --> 00:24:44.724
But let's start with Mark chapter 2.

00:24:44.755 --> 00:24:47.415
Mark chapter 2, verses
27 through 28 says this.

00:24:47.755 --> 00:24:52.515
The Sabbath was made for
man, not man for the Sabbath.

00:24:52.865 --> 00:24:56.365
So then, the Son of Man is
Lord even over the Sabbath.

00:24:56.365 --> 00:24:58.614
Let me just kind of translate this.

00:24:58.645 --> 00:25:01.735
The Sabbath day was meant to
be a blessing, not a burden.

00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:05.205
It was meant to be a blessing to those
who observed it and not a burden.

00:25:05.205 --> 00:25:06.105
Why do we even say this?

00:25:06.325 --> 00:25:12.464
In Jesus day, at this point, the
Pharisees had added around 39 other

00:25:12.465 --> 00:25:15.004
laws and rules attached to the Sabbath.

00:25:15.894 --> 00:25:19.674
Which means it wasn't just rest
from eating or going out and like...

00:25:19.825 --> 00:25:20.615
Cooking food and whatever.

00:25:20.625 --> 00:25:21.845
It was like all these other things.

00:25:21.845 --> 00:25:22.485
You can't do this.

00:25:22.485 --> 00:25:23.085
You can't do this.

00:25:23.085 --> 00:25:23.665
You can't do this.

00:25:23.705 --> 00:25:25.945
You must stand on one
leg, hop around and wait.

00:25:25.945 --> 00:25:27.165
You can't do that because that's moving.

00:25:27.165 --> 00:25:29.004
So like, they begin to add all these laws.

00:25:29.294 --> 00:25:29.774
Here's the thing.

00:25:29.774 --> 00:25:32.125
If you go to Israel
today, present day Israel.

00:25:32.325 --> 00:25:33.845
I actually went a couple of years ago.

00:25:34.405 --> 00:25:37.675
Um, On Shabbat, which is the Sabbath day.

00:25:37.935 --> 00:25:41.675
If you are in a hotel room,
You, the buttons don't work.

00:25:42.225 --> 00:25:44.735
And the, uh, Elevators
stop on every floor.

00:25:45.315 --> 00:25:47.245
Because they don't want
you to have to work.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.050
You're going to be pushing buttons.

00:25:49.129 --> 00:25:52.340
They don't even want the elevator
to have to, like, function, like

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.890
it just kind of works on its own.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:59.640
Like they go to all these other
levels to not, to follow the

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.790
Sabbath laws that were set.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.980
And God, through Jesus, begins to kind
of say like, Woah, woah, woah, like,

00:26:05.309 --> 00:26:07.600
You've missed the point of the Sabbath.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.710
You've missed the point of the Sabbath.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:10.400
Right?

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:13.450
And so the Jews had turned it
into a religious duty, rather

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:14.424
than what God had intended.

00:26:15.315 --> 00:26:18.055
And we even see this in Isaiah
chapter 1 in the Old Testament, they

00:26:18.055 --> 00:26:19.555
were getting it wrong there as well.

00:26:20.115 --> 00:26:24.685
But what was happening is, in the Old
Testament, the Israelites were, uh, doing

00:26:24.685 --> 00:26:26.375
all these rituals, including the Sabbath.

00:26:26.405 --> 00:26:29.454
They were doing them all
correctly, but they weren't

00:26:29.495 --> 00:26:30.445
doing them with the right heart.

00:26:30.454 --> 00:26:32.784
Here's what he basically says in Isaiah
chapter 1, I don't even have this up

00:26:32.784 --> 00:26:34.135
there, but just kind of summarize it.

00:26:34.135 --> 00:26:37.784
God basically said to them, stop
bringing your useless offerings and

00:26:37.784 --> 00:26:42.095
celebrations and celebrations of
Sabbaths, because your heart's not in it.

00:26:42.325 --> 00:26:43.374
I don't even want your offerings.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.430
Don't even bring them, because
your heart is not in it.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.390
You're not even coming
for the right reason.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.020
Translation?

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:58.510
I think, at times, I read the Bible,
I close it, and I checkmark it off,

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.609
and I walk away, and God's saying,
You shouldn't have read that.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:05.310
You shouldn't even, your heart
wasn't, you didn't even care.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.190
Anybody ever been there?

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.300
I think, he could even
be talking about that.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.209
I Grist, but I think he
could be talking about that.

00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:18.409
But we look at this really ultimately,
he says this, that the Son of Man, which

00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:21.419
is Jesus, is Lord even over the Sabbath.

00:27:21.429 --> 00:27:25.610
So Jesus ultimately came to fulfill
the purpose of the Sabbath by

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:29.949
coming to die in our place so that
we could experience eternal rest.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.919
God's original design on day seven.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.699
So we come full circle
where God had rested.

00:27:36.699 --> 00:27:39.479
He wanted his creation to
experience this eternal rest.

00:27:40.404 --> 00:27:43.584
Brokenness came into their lives and
they were not able to experience it.

00:27:43.884 --> 00:27:48.114
God began to implement the day of Sabbath
rest to begin to experience a, a, what

00:27:48.114 --> 00:27:52.554
we call a foretaste or an a, a, a preview
of what that rest could be in the Lord.

00:27:53.215 --> 00:27:59.814
And then Jesus came to fulfill it and
to give it to us now and for eternity.

00:28:01.104 --> 00:28:03.594
He is the Lord of the Sabbath.

00:28:04.644 --> 00:28:05.634
So what does this mean?

00:28:05.634 --> 00:28:06.834
Should we take a Sabbath?

00:28:08.745 --> 00:28:10.965
I'm actually going to give
you a yes and no answer.

00:28:11.554 --> 00:28:13.014
A yes and no answer.

00:28:13.124 --> 00:28:16.344
The reason why as you begin to study the
New Testament, the Sabbath is actually

00:28:16.354 --> 00:28:19.995
not necessarily one of the main, like
out of the ten laws, it's one of the

00:28:19.995 --> 00:28:21.264
ones that's not least talked about.

00:28:21.294 --> 00:28:25.404
Not really talked about as though even
Jesus did a lot of things on the Sabbath.

00:28:25.894 --> 00:28:29.215
Now you saw him take days of rest,
so don't miss what I'm hearing here.

00:28:29.364 --> 00:28:32.894
You see him take days of rest, but I'm
going to read this verse to you, and I'm

00:28:32.904 --> 00:28:36.510
hoping that it doesn't give you It's not
an excuse, but it challenges you to really

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.380
reflect on why we do take a Sabbath.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.110
So Colossians chapter 2, verses 16 and
17, this is coming from Paul the Apostle.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:47.950
He says, don't, so don't let
anyone condemn you for what you

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:51.870
eat or what you drink, or for not
celebrating certain holidays, or

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.510
new moon ceremonies, or Sabbaths.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:59.480
For these rules are only shadows
of the reality yet to come, and

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.340
Christ himself is that reality.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.290
So, do we have to take a Sabbath rest?

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.229
The answer is no.

00:29:06.659 --> 00:29:08.919
In fact, the, Jesus fulfilled the law.

00:29:09.379 --> 00:29:13.340
When he, when we receive Jesus as Lord and
Savior, we are provided that eternal rest.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:17.740
So no, technically, we're not
under the law to have to take that.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.629
Now, I'll come back to this and say this.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.090
When we, I, I use the word command.

00:29:23.294 --> 00:29:25.465
Like, is it commanded
that we have to do this?

00:29:25.524 --> 00:29:25.855
No!

00:29:26.105 --> 00:29:27.175
We are free in Christ.

00:29:27.245 --> 00:29:30.925
Jesus has paid the cost of our
sins so that we can experience

00:29:30.925 --> 00:29:31.945
eternal rest with him.

00:29:32.904 --> 00:29:40.424
But to experience God's rest,
now, God's best now, God set the

00:29:40.424 --> 00:29:42.355
standard of day seven when he rested.

00:29:42.985 --> 00:29:45.955
He continued to give that
blessing to the Israelites.

00:29:46.415 --> 00:29:50.004
And I would believe this, that even
Jesus modeled the need for rest.

00:29:50.785 --> 00:29:54.115
He modeled it where he would take his
disciples away from the work and he says,

00:29:54.145 --> 00:29:55.425
We need to get away from the crowds.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.800
And they would be like, but
Jesus, people need you, and he's

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.400
basically saying, no, we need God.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:01.430
We need time with God.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:02.500
We need time to reflect.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.790
We need time to repent.

00:30:03.999 --> 00:30:05.190
We need time to refresh.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.460
We need time to renew.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:12.510
But if we don't take time to
renew, we are giving our leftovers.

00:30:12.999 --> 00:30:16.140
Not only to God, we're giving
our leftovers to the world.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.300
What is our call from last week?

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.120
Our call from last week is to be
lightbearers, to be lights to the world.

00:30:22.645 --> 00:30:24.015
of who Jesus is.

00:30:24.265 --> 00:30:28.335
How can we be lights to the world
if we aren't reflecting Christ?

00:30:28.335 --> 00:30:31.265
If we're not reflecting God's
character and what God chose

00:30:31.275 --> 00:30:33.495
to do in taking times of rest.

00:30:36.154 --> 00:30:38.524
One person said amen, but the rest
of you are on their knees, okay?

00:30:39.284 --> 00:30:42.865
We need to take time to
reflect and celebrate and cease

00:30:42.945 --> 00:30:45.475
to work just like God did.

00:30:45.565 --> 00:30:47.525
Not just because we're physically tired.

00:30:47.525 --> 00:30:49.955
We are physical beings, and that's
why God gave us sleep, and I

00:30:49.955 --> 00:30:50.815
tell people this all the time.

00:30:51.145 --> 00:30:52.035
I look at sleep.

00:30:52.765 --> 00:30:56.485
As a reminder of our need for rest,
not just sleep rest, but we're talking

00:30:56.485 --> 00:31:00.045
about rest away from world work life.

00:31:00.725 --> 00:31:04.255
Because when we sleep, when we
sleep, and some of you aren't

00:31:04.274 --> 00:31:08.255
getting much of that lately, but
when you sleep, you are refreshed.

00:31:08.855 --> 00:31:14.275
You're able to do more things in a
lot better fashion than if you aren't

00:31:14.275 --> 00:31:16.085
rested, if you haven't slept much.

00:31:16.895 --> 00:31:18.905
Is it not the same spiritually?

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.190
When we rest in the Lord, we take time
to reflect, just like He meant it.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.950
When we take time to reflect.

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:28.270
So it's not meant to be a burden,
it's meant to be a blessing.

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:31.720
So we should truly seek the
Lord and remember why we would

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.459
celebrate and take a time of rest.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.560
It's not a ritual, it's a relationship.

00:31:36.719 --> 00:31:40.900
And the people of Israel
miss this, and we can too.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.730
We can look at it and say this.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:45.950
Again, you may be the person that heard me
today and said, Well Pastor Ben just said

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:47.840
we don't have to take a rest, we're good.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:51.650
Jesus paid it all and all this
I I, I'm telling you, I've heard

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:52.850
people say this, I've quoted this.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.450
I'll rest when I get to heaven.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.370
It's time to work True.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.790
You may get there a lot quicker
if you keep not resting.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:04.450
Okay.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:08.350
Um, but I would say this, and I really
wanna come talk about this briefly

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:09.910
before we kind of finish up today.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:15.430
A lot of times we'll use Sunday as our
Sabbath rest, and I'm not against Sunday.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.880
Technically.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.260
Sabbath rest would've been Saturday, but.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.200
There's no, again, there's no
requirement to practice that on any

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:26.069
specific day, but a lot of times we
use Sunday as our time of Sabbath rest.

00:32:26.499 --> 00:32:31.030
And so we may come physically to
church, and we may do tangible

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:37.350
things in serving, but are we
coming in actually Sabbath resting?

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:42.600
Are we taking time to worship on Sundays,
or are we coming out of duty and service?

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.400
Are we taking time to repent?

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:49.540
During service and on Sundays
and and reflect on Sundays, or

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.850
are we coming because we have to.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:55.430
I mean, I know all the kids out
here, but sometimes my kids say

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.600
this, like we have to go to church.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:01.230
You may be sitting in this room
because a spouse says you have to go.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.069
You may be sitting in this room
because you feel like that I'm

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.290
going to text you again if you don't
come for the third straight week.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:08.040
Sorry, not sorry.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:09.320
I love you all too much.

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:13.990
Um, I don't know, but are you
coming with the right heart?

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.640
Because you may claim this as your
Sabbath rest, and I'm not saying, like,

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.530
this is the end all, but I'm saying
this can be part of your Sabbath rest.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:29.529
To literally take this day and go, God,
wow, I remember what you created me for.

00:33:29.969 --> 00:33:31.420
I remember how you created me.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.400
You knit me my mother's womb.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.010
You gave me a purpose.

00:33:36.835 --> 00:33:37.975
You're an almighty God.

00:33:37.975 --> 00:33:39.145
Oh God, you're so good.

00:33:39.525 --> 00:33:44.535
It allows you time to just sit and
understand that you are broken and

00:33:44.535 --> 00:33:48.535
that you are in need of God every day
and that you weren't godly this week.

00:33:49.015 --> 00:33:50.954
I, I mean, I'm just telling you this.

00:33:51.675 --> 00:33:54.865
Every Sunday is a great opportunity to
reflect and ask God a couple of questions.

00:33:55.015 --> 00:34:00.035
God, have I done anything, said
anything, acted in a way that not

00:34:00.035 --> 00:34:02.035
only just dishonors you, but it's
just not valuable for my life.

00:34:03.195 --> 00:34:05.665
Is there any influences in my life
that are just not good for me?

00:34:06.205 --> 00:34:07.355
Lord, help me turn from them.

00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:11.305
Not because you're judging me as though
I'm this horrible person, but because

00:34:11.305 --> 00:34:12.545
you want something better for me.

00:34:12.705 --> 00:34:14.005
God, help me turn from these things.

00:34:14.115 --> 00:34:15.545
Do we take time to do that?

00:34:15.925 --> 00:34:18.505
Or is Sundays a religious duty?

00:34:18.505 --> 00:34:21.344
Is Sundays, you're looking
at your calendar going, Do I

00:34:21.344 --> 00:34:22.495
serve in children's this week?

00:34:22.495 --> 00:34:23.825
Do I gotta do setup?

00:34:24.615 --> 00:34:26.265
Man, I gotta get there early.

00:34:26.705 --> 00:34:28.025
Oh gosh, I gotta preach again.

00:34:28.675 --> 00:34:30.375
Or do we look at it as an opportunity?

00:34:30.785 --> 00:34:35.325
To actually experience God's Sabbath
rest through Jesus Christ, right?

00:34:35.325 --> 00:34:40.535
These things, at times, these things
that we do, coming on Sunday, can become,

00:34:40.765 --> 00:34:43.314
in our minds, our offering to the Lord.

00:34:43.944 --> 00:34:45.834
And the Lord says, I don't want it.

00:34:48.055 --> 00:34:48.554
I don't want it.

00:34:48.624 --> 00:34:51.795
I'd rather have your heart
than whatever else you do.

00:34:52.345 --> 00:34:54.945
I'd rather have your heart
than you just to have a perfect

00:34:54.945 --> 00:34:55.975
attendance on Sunday morning.

00:34:56.655 --> 00:35:02.964
I'd rather have, I'd rather
you, you have my rest.

00:35:04.205 --> 00:35:07.495
Is this, I'm hoping, is this
convicting or affirming to you?

00:35:08.015 --> 00:35:09.835
Because for some of you may be
sitting here going, Praise God,

00:35:10.435 --> 00:35:11.475
I experienced the Sabbath rest.

00:35:11.475 --> 00:35:12.675
I experienced on a Sunday morning.

00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:16.234
Some of you may be like,
I am dead in my heart.

00:35:16.275 --> 00:35:18.974
I am dead in my worship.

00:35:18.985 --> 00:35:19.885
I am dead in my repentance.

00:35:20.295 --> 00:35:24.574
And I have not experienced the
Sabbath rest that God has given me.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:30.180
And I know this, it's easy for us to
forget what Jesus has done for us.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.610
Jesus died so that we can experience rest.

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:36.020
Jesus died so that we can experience rest.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:42.450
Why do we keep denying rest
and saying that my work is

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.749
more important than your rest?

00:35:45.719 --> 00:35:48.830
So one of my last questions to you
is, as image bearers of God to the

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:54.539
world, have you, we, accepted Jesus
fulfillment of the Sabbath rest?

00:35:55.025 --> 00:35:57.825
By repenting of our sins and
accepting His eternal rest.

00:35:59.575 --> 00:36:00.505
I want to give you a quote here.

00:36:00.505 --> 00:36:04.105
It's been said that most
people in our world are being

00:36:04.115 --> 00:36:06.265
crucified between two thieves.

00:36:07.404 --> 00:36:10.325
The regrets of yesterday
and the worries of tomorrow.

00:36:11.035 --> 00:36:12.965
And that's why we can't enjoy rest today.

00:36:15.035 --> 00:36:15.465
That's tough.

00:36:16.225 --> 00:36:16.635
That's tough.

00:36:17.305 --> 00:36:22.655
God has given us an example of why He
implemented Rest into our lives, to

00:36:22.655 --> 00:36:27.665
worship and remember, to celebrate and
enjoy, to take time to repent and evaluate

00:36:27.665 --> 00:36:30.825
our lives, to truly experience His rest.

00:36:31.684 --> 00:36:35.705
And the Sabbath rest helps us
remember to trust God, remember to

00:36:35.705 --> 00:36:37.725
see small work, and depend on Him.

00:36:39.535 --> 00:36:43.675
You know, I, I started thinking through
this the other day, um, I actually

00:36:43.675 --> 00:36:46.765
went to the chiropractor last week
and I got an x ray on my back, it's

00:36:46.765 --> 00:36:48.035
been having just lower back issues.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.250
And, uh, he shows me his picture, and
really, he kind of puts the picture

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:53.510
up there, and he leaves, and he comes
back to tell me about the picture, but

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.150
I already knew something was wrong.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:58.510
My lower back had this little
curve, and I'm like, that doesn't

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.049
look right, no longer I feel pain.

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:03.169
Um, and he began to talk to me, and he's
like, hey, it's good that you came in,

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:09.110
because if you would have kept allowing
your back to hang out this way, over

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:12.210
time, it would, and he showed me some of
the pictures, it could look like this.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.670
And then you would have to probably
go have surgery, and I wasn't

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:17.905
anywhere near that, but he's like,
Honestly, what happens is people don't

00:37:17.905 --> 00:37:20.805
come in to get their backs fixed.

00:37:20.825 --> 00:37:25.105
They just ignore the pain, they ignore
what they're feeling, and they keep

00:37:25.105 --> 00:37:27.915
driving on thinking, if I just work,
if I just keep working hard, if I

00:37:27.954 --> 00:37:29.845
just ignore it, it's gonna fix itself.

00:37:30.465 --> 00:37:35.345
See, that really made me start thinking
that if we don't take time to rest,

00:37:36.055 --> 00:37:39.385
evaluate our lives, we're gonna end
up like that spiritually one day.

00:37:39.945 --> 00:37:42.675
I'm gonna end up like that spiritually
one day, where my back is mangled,

00:37:42.955 --> 00:37:45.404
and I will be disabled spiritually.

00:37:45.695 --> 00:37:49.485
In a way that I may recover from, but
not the way that I could have if I

00:37:49.485 --> 00:37:51.255
would have just done something sooner.

00:37:51.935 --> 00:37:53.675
So I'm thankful I went
to the Carpenter Center.

00:37:54.935 --> 00:37:57.905
And I'll just challenge this, I think
you'll be thankful if you come to Jesus.

00:37:58.814 --> 00:38:02.654
I think you'll be thankful if you'll
take time today just to say, Lord,

00:38:02.814 --> 00:38:04.815
I want to experience your rest.

00:38:06.915 --> 00:38:09.955
So we're going to take some
time during invitation to just

00:38:09.965 --> 00:38:11.415
pour our hearts out to God.

00:38:11.435 --> 00:38:11.975
I love you.

00:38:11.975 --> 00:38:15.335
I'll just walk you through a couple
of things that we can think through

00:38:15.335 --> 00:38:18.435
and pray through, and I hope that
you will take some time to do that.

00:38:18.465 --> 00:38:19.414
I hope you do.

00:38:19.524 --> 00:38:20.575
So let me just pray for us.

00:38:20.575 --> 00:38:26.075
Lord Jesus, um, I just pray, Lord,
that as we take some time for

00:38:26.175 --> 00:38:27.885
invitation, Lord, this is the time.

00:38:28.265 --> 00:38:32.784
I believe that so many in this
room can experience your rest.

00:38:33.895 --> 00:38:38.605
Lord, I pray that you clear their minds
of the regrets of yesterday, and you clear

00:38:38.605 --> 00:38:44.695
their minds of the worries of tomorrow,
and you allow them, Lord, in this moment

00:38:44.724 --> 00:38:50.575
to sit right where they are, Lord, and
to experience your rest, your presence,

00:38:51.505 --> 00:38:54.375
your word, your truth, your life.

00:38:55.565 --> 00:39:00.095
God, help me experience I know
I need it personally as well.

00:39:01.335 --> 00:39:04.545
So Lord, work through our hearts.

00:39:05.675 --> 00:39:08.835
So the first thing that I want to lead
you to pray this morning, and this

00:39:08.835 --> 00:39:10.495
is where I believe we have to start.

00:39:10.885 --> 00:39:14.174
It's really the last question
that I posed to you earlier.

00:39:14.595 --> 00:39:17.755
As I just challenge you, right where
you sit, ask the Lord this question.

00:39:17.995 --> 00:39:21.965
Have I truly rested in
you as Lord and Jesus?

00:39:22.015 --> 00:39:25.235
Lord and Savior of your lives.

00:39:25.475 --> 00:39:26.375
Ask the Lord that question.

00:39:26.615 --> 00:39:27.855
Have I truly accepted you?

00:39:27.855 --> 00:39:29.044
Have I truly accepted you?

00:39:30.395 --> 00:39:35.135
Your rest and whatever the Lord responds
to you, there's a next step But I just

00:39:35.135 --> 00:39:36.095
want you to take some time to do that.

00:39:36.105 --> 00:39:39.424
Lord, have I truly accepted your
rest through a relationship with you?

00:39:39.425 --> 00:39:41.624
So take some time to ask
the Lord that question

00:39:58.205 --> 00:40:01.134
So I believe there's two
responses the Lord will give you.

00:40:01.135 --> 00:40:09.504
Number one is yes But maybe not
recently There's another one where you

00:40:09.915 --> 00:40:13.840
you actually hear the Lord say you've
never given your life to Jesus And I

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.540
believe right now where you're sitting,
you can give your life to Jesus.

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.970
I believe that you can repent
of your sins and ask God to

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:21.319
forgive you and to experience
the blessings that He has in you.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.450
That's how simple it is.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:26.139
So if you're sitting here right now, and
you're saying, I've never experienced

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:29.800
true rest in Jesus, where you've
given your life to Him, I challenge

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:32.910
you right where you sit to ask the
Lord to give you that true rest.

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.710
Those of you that have given your
lives to Christ, maybe you're

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:44.365
sitting there and you're saying,
I haven't experienced it recently.

00:40:44.395 --> 00:40:44.965
What do we do?

00:40:46.735 --> 00:40:49.815
I think once you've asked the Lord that
question, you know where your heart is,

00:40:49.815 --> 00:40:55.925
I think it's time to start taking time
to worship the Lord, and experience the

00:40:55.925 --> 00:40:58.074
original creation rest that God had given.

00:40:58.105 --> 00:41:01.055
So I want you to just take some time
right now to reflect back to day 7.

00:41:01.205 --> 00:41:03.925
Imagine you're sitting there
with God, and God just got

00:41:03.925 --> 00:41:05.915
done working, and He's resting.

00:41:06.345 --> 00:41:09.175
And you're resting beside Him,
and you're experiencing creation.

00:41:09.685 --> 00:41:11.345
And you're experiencing
all that God has just done.

00:41:11.355 --> 00:41:14.755
I want you to just begin to worship Him
and say, Thank you, Lord, for creation.

00:41:14.755 --> 00:41:15.825
Thank you for my life.

00:41:16.255 --> 00:41:17.755
Thank you for what you've done in my life.

00:41:18.015 --> 00:41:20.645
So just take some time to
worship the Lord and thank Him.

00:41:21.695 --> 00:41:21.845
The

00:41:57.724 --> 00:42:01.024
next one is one that I think is the
most difficult at times in our lives.

00:42:01.025 --> 00:42:05.585
It's, I'm hoping that as you've
taken time to worship Him, remember

00:42:05.585 --> 00:42:06.705
what the Lord has done for you.

00:42:07.165 --> 00:42:08.175
What He's done in creation.

00:42:09.465 --> 00:42:11.155
That this next part will be easier.

00:42:12.315 --> 00:42:15.805
I challenge you to just ask the
Lord to reveal to you right now

00:42:16.535 --> 00:42:19.375
areas of your life where you need
to repent eternally from your sin.

00:42:20.174 --> 00:42:23.864
Sin is experiencing the least.

00:42:23.874 --> 00:42:25.545
It's not experiencing God's best.

00:42:25.584 --> 00:42:27.074
God has something greater for you.

00:42:27.984 --> 00:42:31.205
So ask God to bring to your mind or
your heart what you need to repent

00:42:31.265 --> 00:42:33.545
of, and I'm just going to give you
some areas He may be leading you to.

00:42:33.545 --> 00:42:37.865
Number one, maybe that you haven't
given Him your time, which means you

00:42:37.865 --> 00:42:39.990
haven't given And rest of your life.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:45.270
Maybe it's your finances, maybe it's
your family or your job, or here's

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:47.010
a difficult one of your purity.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:51.300
So if God puts some of those
things on your heart, I just pray

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.840
that you ask the Lord to forgive
you and help you experience the

00:42:54.845 --> 00:42:56.760
blessing of rest in those areas.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.750
So take some time to do that.

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:36.240
Last thing that I want to challenge you
to just ask the Lord to help you with,

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.850
which you may have already done just
in that time, but I want you to just

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:40.240
ask the Lord to help you experience.

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:43.390
It's Sabbath rest this week.

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:47.440
That may just be resting for an hour
away from all the distractions of life.

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:49.420
That may be resting for a full day.

00:43:50.049 --> 00:43:52.950
That may be getting away with your
spouse somewhere and taking some rest.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.229
I don't know what it is, but just ask
the Lord to help you cease from work

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.639
and experience true Sabbath rest.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.150
Not because you have to, but
because He wants to bless you.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.330
So ask God to help you
experience that this week.

00:44:40.225 --> 00:44:41.575
I want to challenge you with this thought.

00:44:42.125 --> 00:44:45.155
Something that me and Brittany
have really struggled with at

00:44:45.155 --> 00:44:47.595
times and have really reflected.

00:44:47.665 --> 00:44:51.525
Um, if you're anything like
us, um, life is chaotic.

00:44:51.764 --> 00:44:56.205
When you plant in a church, many
jobs you have, as many kids you have.

00:44:56.765 --> 00:45:02.695
And something that we have tried to redeem
is our attitudes towards our busy life.

00:45:03.695 --> 00:45:08.075
Um, we can either enjoy
it or we can hate it.

00:45:11.565 --> 00:45:14.695
I think recently we've been seeing that
is although it seems like we're always

00:45:14.705 --> 00:45:19.185
going one place or the other, I feel
like I've been experiencing some rest.

00:45:19.295 --> 00:45:21.875
Um, and I'm gonna try
not to get emotional.

00:45:22.375 --> 00:45:22.785
Um,

00:45:28.384 --> 00:45:30.835
just watching my kids
enjoy what they love to do.

00:45:31.545 --> 00:45:34.175
Not thinking about you guys,
not thinking about ministry.

00:45:35.365 --> 00:45:36.754
Because that's what I think about 24 7.

00:45:39.205 --> 00:45:45.155
And, uh, those have been some of the
most restful moments, just enjoying

00:45:46.085 --> 00:45:47.815
the presence of God in their lives.

00:45:48.975 --> 00:45:53.515
You know, seeing my kids just do what
they love to do, and just resting in that.

00:45:55.414 --> 00:45:59.615
So for some of you, you may go, how, with
the busy lives that we have, and all the

00:45:59.615 --> 00:46:01.735
kids that we have, how do we get rest?

00:46:02.135 --> 00:46:03.495
Sometimes you just gotta find it there.

00:46:04.715 --> 00:46:07.265
Sometimes you just gotta find it
in holding your spouse's hand.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:13.300
Why you're in the middle of the chaos,
and you just rest and you experience

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.650
God's creation in that moment.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:17.910
And you thank God for who He
is and what He's provided.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.880
Yes, I believe, and I'm challenging
myself to get more quote unquote rest.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.149
Not sleep, although I feel
like I've worked on that a lot.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:28.250
But true rest from work.

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.060
True rest from the pressures of life.

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:32.190
And even I'm wrestling with that, guys.

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:34.020
And so I'll just tell you as your pastor.

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.320
If you struggle with it, I do too.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.690
It doesn't mean we stay there.

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:41.060
It means we keep pursuing the blessing
that God has provided all the way

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.720
back in creation from day seven.

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.170
And I'm going to continue to pursue
it, even in those moments of craziness.

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:48.460
And I challenge you, just don't.

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:50.800
I mean, we're here for
transformation, not information.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.910
I pray that you don't leave
out of here and go, I'll praise

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:55.940
God, I mean, I hope you decide.

00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:00.140
I hope that you take it and you go,
I'll praise God, I found something

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.420
the Lord revealed in my time.

00:47:02.715 --> 00:47:05.005
invitation to experience.

00:47:05.955 --> 00:47:07.815
God says He's experienced.

00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:10.405
This rest for us is a blessing.

00:47:11.105 --> 00:47:12.465
Reach out and grab it this week.

00:47:13.315 --> 00:47:17.405
Because on the other side of a
blessing, man, is the presence of God.

00:47:19.535 --> 00:47:20.994
Let's stand and let's worship.

00:47:21.244 --> 00:47:21.304
Let's go.
