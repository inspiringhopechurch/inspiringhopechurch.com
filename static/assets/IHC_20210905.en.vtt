00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.020
Okay.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.290
Um, so today we are going to be
continuing, um, our Jonah series

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.280
is what I'm kind of, uh, labeling
this and over the last couple of

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.230
weeks, we've covered six verses.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.320
Um, so how many verses you
think we'll cover today?

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.860
Anybody?

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.349
No, we're actually going to cover
the, almost the rest of the chapter.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.820
So good news.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.540
Yeah.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.580
It kind of speeds up a little bit.

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.430
Um, and you'll, you'll kind of
see the theme of, of really kind

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.150
of, it's getting to this point.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:38.565
Let's see kind of what happens.

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:41.505
And so over the last couple of
weeks, we've really dealt with

00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:42.735
several different things, right.

00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:45.315
With the story of Jonah, but the
verses, we're not going to read

00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:46.335
all of the verses this week.

00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:47.865
So we're going to actually
start in verse six.

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:51.855
So Jonah chapter one, verse
six, again, just a reminder.

00:00:51.855 --> 00:00:54.945
If you don't have a Bible and you
would love one there's one on the

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:59.775
next steps table, it's yours free,
um, on your way out, grab it.

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:01.355
Um, but if you don't use.

00:01:02.235 --> 00:01:05.175
Handheld Bible, use one on your
phone again, download the Bible app.

00:01:05.175 --> 00:01:07.215
That's a great way to
carry the Bible with you.

00:01:07.215 --> 00:01:11.205
But, um, the, the first, basically
several verses that we dealt with

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:12.735
is really just the story of Jonah.

00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:16.485
Who's a prophet, which can a prophet
hears from the word or hears from

00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:17.985
the Lord, a word from the Lord.

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:19.634
And he proclaims that word.

00:01:19.935 --> 00:01:22.604
Well, this time it didn't like
what God wanted him to say.

00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:26.804
And so he ran and he seemed to be
at peace, sleeping in the bottom

00:01:26.804 --> 00:01:28.545
of the boat while a storm came.

00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:30.905
And that's kind of really
where we pick up in this.

00:01:32.085 --> 00:01:35.565
But I kind of want to start off with
this idea, um, because we've talked to

00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:36.435
you about a couple different things.

00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:39.075
One is Jonah had the wrong attitude
towards the word of God, the will

00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:40.304
of God, the people of God, right.

00:01:40.304 --> 00:01:41.354
His circumstances.

00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:42.615
But he also.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.600
Was really just choosing
to live a second rate life.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.730
And that's really what we dealt
with last week is he chose

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.690
to live a second rate life?

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.560
Well, what does that mean?

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.280
That means that God has a first
rate life for him to live a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.660
first rate life for us to live.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.160
What does that first rate life look like?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.360
It's as really within his will
and it's God's best for us, but we

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.960
continually choose God's second best,
or maybe sometimes it's our, it's our

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.700
third best of what God has for us.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.910
But I wanted to start with this,
this, this, this question anybody

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.130
ever heard there's no, I in team.

00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:15.375
But did anybody realize that
there's actually me in team?

00:02:16.065 --> 00:02:17.025
So it is all about me.

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:20.025
Do you ever notice that about the world
and sometimes even about our lives?

00:02:20.025 --> 00:02:25.845
Is it, if it affects me, I want to
basically I want it to be about me.

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:28.695
I want to be able to
control my circumstances.

00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:31.395
I want to be in the most
comfortable position.

00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:34.575
I don't want to be bothered or
questioned about what I believe

00:02:34.575 --> 00:02:35.655
in what I don't believe in.

00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:38.775
It's kind of this me too movement,
basically where people are

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:43.010
like trying to find these ways
of, Hey, It's all about me.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.550
Um, and, and maybe you don't recognize
that in your life, but if you'll start

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.620
thinking about some of the things
you hold strong to about that is your

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.080
comfort zone or your place, right.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.120
Or maybe it's what you do.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.750
And if that routine changed,
you would really get frustrated

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.830
because it's all about you.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.070
And maybe you don't realize that, but
we, we look at this story with Jonah

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.150
and Jonah is coming to this point where
it's, he's living a self centered.

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:12.685
Um, and it's not self-center life,
even though maybe that's what

00:03:12.685 --> 00:03:15.985
he's living, but centered live a
self-centered life and meaning a

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:18.745
selfish mentality and how he's living.

00:03:19.135 --> 00:03:22.525
And so we saw that just even those
first couple of, of stories where

00:03:22.555 --> 00:03:26.335
part verses that we dealt with is
this idea behind Jonah, just not

00:03:26.335 --> 00:03:30.175
really caring about anybody else
around him, other than himself

00:03:30.205 --> 00:03:32.245
getting away from the presence of God.

00:03:33.055 --> 00:03:39.030
And so when we think about just this
idea of what is Jonah doing, I know

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.190
for me, as I continued to study this
Jonah living a self-centered life really

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.390
reminds me maybe of the self-centered
life that I live and maybe the wrong

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.680
attitudes that I have towards the will
of God and baby, really the second

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.030
way of life that I'm choosing to live
rather than the life that God has for.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.600
And I think I asked this question
maybe a couple of weeks ago,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.120
but this idea of do you want to
make a difference in your life?

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.300
Right?

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.690
Do you want to be a better version of
yourself today than you were yesterday?

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.100
And majority of us raised our hand.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.930
I think some of us didn't want to
raise her hands because we didn't

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.070
want maybe to even be held accountable
to that idea of living maybe a

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.040
better life than what we currently
live, maybe within the will of God.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.620
And, um, but I think most of us want to,
but our selfishness gets in the way from

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.720
living the life that God's playing for us.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.290
And so today we're going
to kind of see how.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.330
Is dealing with this same thing, right?

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.500
The self-centeredness right.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.480
The wrong attitude towards
what God wants them to do.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.480
And so let's jump into the text so
we can see this a little bit more.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.710
So we're going to start in verse six.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.370
I know last week, verse six, we
read, but it's going to be key in

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.650
our transition into verse seven.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.730
So it says this can Jonah chapter one,
verse six, it says the captain approached.

00:04:45.555 --> 00:04:48.165
Speaking of Jonah and
said, what are you doing?

00:04:48.165 --> 00:04:51.375
Sound asleep, get up and
call out to your God.

00:04:51.405 --> 00:04:53.595
Maybe this God will consider us.

00:04:54.015 --> 00:04:55.245
And we won't perish.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.460
And the next verse says,
come on, the sellers said to

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.620
each other, let's cast lots.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.219
Then we'll know who is to blame
for this trouble we're in.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.950
So they cast lots and the
lot singled out, Jonah.

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:11.130
And then they said to him, tell us
who is to blame for this trouble.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.490
We're in, what is your business
and where are you from?

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.670
And what is your country
and the people are you from.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.870
And so he answered them.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.350
I'm a Hebrew and I worship
the Lord, the God of heaven

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.150
who made the sea and the dry.

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:28.025
Then the men were seized with
great fear and said to him, what

00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:29.765
is it this that you've done?

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:33.635
And the men knew he was fleeing from the
Lord's presence because he had told them.

00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:38.105
And so they said to him, what,
or what should we do so that

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:39.485
the sea will calm down for us.

00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:41.555
And for the sea was
getting worse and worse.

00:05:42.005 --> 00:05:42.815
And he answered them.

00:05:42.815 --> 00:05:46.865
He said, pick me up and throw me into the
sea so that it will calm down for you.

00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:50.735
Brian know that I am to blame for
this is a great storm that is against.

00:05:51.855 --> 00:05:55.845
Nevertheless, the men rode harder
and harder to get back to dry land,

00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:59.025
but they couldn't because the sea was
raging against them more and more.

00:05:59.505 --> 00:06:01.725
And so they called out to the
Lord, please, Lord, don't let us

00:06:01.725 --> 00:06:03.285
perish because of this man's life.

00:06:03.645 --> 00:06:07.185
And don't charge us with his
innocent blood for the Lord.

00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:09.165
You have done just as you please.

00:06:09.465 --> 00:06:12.975
And then they picked him up and threw
him into the sea and the sea stopped

00:06:12.975 --> 00:06:17.775
raging and the men were seized with
great fear and the Lord of the Lord.

00:06:17.775 --> 00:06:20.415
And they offered a sacrifice
to the Lord and made.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.640
So, where do we see Jonah
living a self-centered life?

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.690
It really comes to this
picture in verse six to seven.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.610
The starts this idea of this.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.720
Self-centeredness see self-centeredness
will always catch up to us.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.690
So just so you know, whenever I'm
talking about this, Jonah would be

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.640
somebody who would be characterized as
someone who served the Lord, anybody

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.430
that has given their life to Jesus
that says I'm a follower of Jesus.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.230
You have given your life to the Lord.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.005
And so in this picture, Anybody
that is a follower of Jesus

00:06:53.034 --> 00:06:54.685
that lives a self-centered life.

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:56.335
It will catch up to you.

00:06:57.025 --> 00:06:59.875
It will always catch up to you
meaning this, that, that will not

00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:01.405
cut it as a follower of Jesus.

00:07:01.675 --> 00:07:02.245
It just won't.

00:07:02.275 --> 00:07:05.425
And there's some reasons why
maybe you'll understand why we

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.525
shouldn't be okay with that.

00:07:07.525 --> 00:07:07.855
Right.

00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:11.275
And so we'll, we'll find that
everything doesn't revolve around.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.940
And when I even say this is when it
comes to our relationship with Jesus

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.230
too many times, we come to faith in
Jesus and we spend the rest of our lives

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.980
focused on only our relationship, rather
than on the relationships that he's

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.530
called us to go live with other people.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.400
And so that's even part of the selfishness
that I would say are self centered living,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.030
I would say with this, but we see this,
it says, as Jonah woke up the captain

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.210
or the, by the captain, he realized that
he was caught running from the Lord.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.840
Anybody ever had a kid come in
with chocolate on his face after

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.090
you told him not to get into the
chocolate, maybe that was you.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.140
And the parent asks you, did
you get in the chocolate that

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.159
I told you not to get into?

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:53.039
And the kid said, see, it's that moment
where God called out Jonah through.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.080
The captain and says, Hey,
get up, call out to your God.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.090
Maybe he will hear us.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.200
And the storm will stop.

00:08:01.799 --> 00:08:06.810
And Jonah had been caught it's that moment
that he had the opportunity to repent and

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:11.969
turn back to the Lord and you know what
he said, and well, how do you know that?

00:08:11.969 --> 00:08:16.140
Well, if you look, if you go from verse
six to verse seven, the captain's asking

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.000
him to get up and call out to his God.

00:08:18.929 --> 00:08:21.299
But then in the next first you
see the seller say, come on,

00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:22.590
let's cast lots to figure out who.

00:08:23.385 --> 00:08:23.775
Problem.

00:08:23.775 --> 00:08:26.594
This is there's something missing here.

00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:29.294
Jonah's response that we
would expect from him, right?

00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:33.465
He had been caught if he knows it's
his fault, this storm is there and

00:08:33.465 --> 00:08:36.164
he refuses to take ownership of it.

00:08:36.225 --> 00:08:37.875
He refuses to take ownership of it.

00:08:38.655 --> 00:08:42.885
And I think that's so important to
see in this is he was confronted

00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:46.064
and even just, he refused to do it.

00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:47.055
He knew.

00:08:47.085 --> 00:08:48.105
Did he ever call it to God?

00:08:48.105 --> 00:08:48.495
We don't even know.

00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:51.120
And so let me ask this question.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.500
I love asking questions to you guys.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.849
Why do you believe Jonah?

00:08:53.849 --> 00:08:57.390
Didn't call out to God from
verse six, he had the opportunity

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.670
to, he had been called out God.

00:08:59.699 --> 00:09:01.620
I mean, I'm telling you just
the same way as we call it.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.829
The kids that have the chocolate on
their face, they know they're wrong.

00:09:04.859 --> 00:09:05.729
Jonah knew he was wrong.

00:09:05.729 --> 00:09:08.010
Why do you think he didn't
call out to his God?

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.660
I didn't feel like he could
approach gun or Ascot.

00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:14.900
Okay.

00:09:16.525 --> 00:09:17.305
Didn't want the answer.

00:09:17.305 --> 00:09:18.235
That's another good one.

00:09:18.595 --> 00:09:19.194
What else?

00:09:21.805 --> 00:09:22.555
He didn't want to acknowledge.

00:09:22.555 --> 00:09:23.155
He was hearing him.

00:09:23.935 --> 00:09:24.415
That's good.

00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:25.975
Anybody else?

00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:30.855
Yeah.

00:09:31.635 --> 00:09:32.505
That's the other thing, right?

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:34.185
He didn't want to be thrown
into the ocean maybe.

00:09:34.185 --> 00:09:34.454
Right?

00:09:34.454 --> 00:09:37.334
So he, maybe he understood that it
was his punishment would be that.

00:09:37.964 --> 00:09:41.775
See, I go back to, why do kids
dismiss certain circumstance?

00:09:41.805 --> 00:09:42.105
Why is it.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.560
Say, huh?

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.590
Because of the consequences
of what they did.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:52.120
And it's, it's, it's interesting
at times as a follower of Jesus and

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.350
we, maybe we lived our lifestyle for
Jesus for a time and maybe we gave

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.990
her life to Jesus at one point in
our lives, but then we have walked

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.450
away and the Lord confronts our sin.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.130
And rather than admitting and turning
back to the Lord, we deny because

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.630
we're afraid of maybe consequences.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.620
We're afraid of the.

00:10:08.505 --> 00:10:11.775
I don't know what it is, but I know
that at times we wrestle with this and

00:10:11.775 --> 00:10:13.995
obviously Jonah wrestle with this as well.

00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:18.495
But we do know this, that God
has placed storms people and all

00:10:18.495 --> 00:10:21.735
different circumstances in our
lives to lead us back to him.

00:10:22.005 --> 00:10:25.575
Again, lead us back to the first rate
life that God has planned for each one

00:10:25.575 --> 00:10:30.315
of us to be used for his glory and to
be in a right relationship with him.

00:10:30.345 --> 00:10:33.595
He puts these things in our place,
not for our bad, but for our.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:37.785
But sometimes we recognize them
just like Jonah did maybe as bad.

00:10:38.685 --> 00:10:40.695
And so again, we see verse seven, right?

00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:46.845
Um, he says that they cast lots
to see who basically it was

00:10:46.845 --> 00:10:47.805
since Jonah wouldn't fess up.

00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:49.515
So you understand what casting lots was.

00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:52.215
It's something that they would
use in order to see the will

00:10:52.215 --> 00:10:53.565
of God in a circumstance.

00:10:53.895 --> 00:10:57.615
You'll actually, if you remember
in the book of acts, the

00:10:57.705 --> 00:10:58.965
apostles actually do this to.

00:10:59.835 --> 00:11:00.915
Figure out who's going to be the 12th.

00:11:00.915 --> 00:11:06.675
Apostle since Judas had obviously
had, um, rejected the Lord, but it

00:11:06.675 --> 00:11:10.185
was a form of seeking the Lord's will
before the holy spirit was present.

00:11:10.755 --> 00:11:13.245
So for us, the holy spirit is present.

00:11:13.245 --> 00:11:14.675
And so we don't necessarily
need to cast lots.

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:16.155
So if you're wondering,
where do we get those lots?

00:11:16.155 --> 00:11:17.415
So we can do this every day.

00:11:17.895 --> 00:11:18.885
Don't go find them.

00:11:18.915 --> 00:11:19.935
There's not a need.

00:11:19.935 --> 00:11:23.385
If you have a relationship with Jesus,
we have the ability to seek his word.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.390
And seek him through prayer
to get that confirmation.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.420
We don't need casting of lots, but
that's what they did in this time.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.640
So Joanie didn't need to
see the results, right.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.810
He already knew it.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.710
And so I think about this,
God gives us all opportunities

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.670
to come clean and repent.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.630
It's called conviction.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.960
It gives us all the opportunity, but.

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.824
Many times we don't take that opportunity.

00:11:45.824 --> 00:11:48.015
And so this is what I think
about, and this is what's going

00:11:48.015 --> 00:11:50.775
to happen to Jonah, with my kids.

00:11:50.925 --> 00:11:53.564
There's those times where you're like,
somebody better tell me who did this.

00:11:53.564 --> 00:11:56.025
And if you don't, there'll
be worse consequences.

00:11:56.025 --> 00:12:00.795
When I figured out anybody I've been told
that this was God's way, God gave him an

00:12:00.795 --> 00:12:03.915
opportunity to repent and he chose not to.

00:12:03.915 --> 00:12:06.104
And so they cast lots,
they figured it out.

00:12:06.194 --> 00:12:06.974
God figured it out.

00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:13.459
And the storm kept getting worse and
worse and the storms of our life.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.729
When we reject God, when we
refuse to repent turn, we'll

00:12:16.729 --> 00:12:18.170
continue to get worse and worse.

00:12:18.469 --> 00:12:19.459
Well, why would God do that?

00:12:19.459 --> 00:12:23.300
Because he loves you too much to leave
you and the condition that you're in.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.420
I think that's the picture that
we all need to consistently

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.430
hear is God loves us so much.

00:12:28.459 --> 00:12:32.120
He doesn't want us to continue to
living a second rate life, a life.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.229
That is self-centered one that
is not for his glory and for our.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.180
So I want you to just think back those
of you who were here last week, you

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.550
know, I was talking about this idea
of what is it maybe that you're living

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:47.130
in a second rate life in, I don't know
what area of your life maybe you were

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.310
thinking through last week, but thank
through last week, maybe an area that

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.750
you thought through, what is that area?

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.240
That I'm just not living
my life fully out for God.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:58.950
The question that I want to ask
you is, did you recognize it

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.510
and then walk away last week?

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.130
Or did you recognize.

00:13:03.525 --> 00:13:07.455
Repent of it and begin turning and
walking the way that God's called you.

00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:10.485
And maybe you'd say, Hey, I don't even
remember what you preached on last week.

00:13:10.515 --> 00:13:11.145
Good news.

00:13:11.775 --> 00:13:12.945
Go to inspiring hope church.com.

00:13:12.945 --> 00:13:14.355
You can go back and rewatch the message.

00:13:14.445 --> 00:13:18.225
And I would encourage you to ask God
as you've maybe rewatch this message.

00:13:18.435 --> 00:13:20.385
God, where is it that
I'm living a second rate?

00:13:21.225 --> 00:13:23.715
And as we're hearing this week, where is
it that I'm living a self-centered life

00:13:23.925 --> 00:13:28.665
and actually turn to the Lord and ask
for forgiveness and then ask people to

00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:32.355
invite them into your life, to help you
overcome that area of your life for your

00:13:32.355 --> 00:13:34.485
good and for the benefit of other people.

00:13:35.055 --> 00:13:40.365
See, if not, we're just like Jonah, we
hear God bringing up about an opportunity

00:13:40.365 --> 00:13:44.324
for repentance, but we reject God
and we continue on living without it.

00:13:44.985 --> 00:13:46.155
And I just don't want us to miss.

00:13:46.815 --> 00:13:47.385
In this.

00:13:47.775 --> 00:13:49.125
So let's, let's keep
looking at these verses.

00:13:49.125 --> 00:13:51.825
So we look at verse eight, obviously
the sellers figure out who it is.

00:13:52.185 --> 00:13:56.055
Then they ask a bunch of questions
to Jonah and let's look, let's

00:13:56.065 --> 00:13:57.075
look at these questions here.

00:13:58.035 --> 00:14:00.375
It says, I think this is so interesting.

00:14:00.375 --> 00:14:03.285
They said, so then they said to him,
tell us who is to blame for this trouble.

00:14:03.285 --> 00:14:03.705
We're in.

00:14:04.725 --> 00:14:06.825
Well, for one, they
just singled out Jonah.

00:14:06.825 --> 00:14:11.175
So Jonah's got to know, this says,
tell us who's to blame what your

00:14:11.175 --> 00:14:12.735
business is, where you're from.

00:14:13.425 --> 00:14:16.875
Where's your country, what people
you're in for me, I don't know.

00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:18.314
Would've asked any of those questions.

00:14:18.314 --> 00:14:22.395
I would've just been like you idiot, like,
but they didn't ask all these questions.

00:14:22.395 --> 00:14:27.314
So what did he do rather than
responding in humility and asking for

00:14:27.314 --> 00:14:31.125
them to forgive him for putting them
in this storm, he responds a little

00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:34.905
bit prideful and if you don't catch
it the first time I didn't either.

00:14:34.964 --> 00:14:36.675
And so I started studying
this a little bit more.

00:14:37.244 --> 00:14:40.244
When you look at this, he really responded
in a very prideful way, and I could just

00:14:40.244 --> 00:14:41.895
see him kind of boasting about this.

00:14:41.895 --> 00:14:46.440
He says, I'm a Hebrew and I worship
the Lord, the God of the heavens

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.750
who made the sea and the dry land.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.260
See, he didn't say, Hey, I'm, I'm the
one responsible now later on, he does.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.450
But he doesn't say, Hey, I'm
the one responsible cause they

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.100
asked whose whose fault is this?

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.120
It doesn't say that.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.770
But he begins to boast about that.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:01.170
He's a Hebrew, which again, they
asked that question was a Hebrew,

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.490
but I'm, I'm worship the God of the
heavens and the sea and the land.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.850
It's funny how he wants to claim
God now in front of people who.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.750
Look at him, maybe more like as though
he's something special rather than

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.770
being humble about, I did worship
the Lord and I'm running from him.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.699
That's not what he said.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.589
So I look at this instance as is he had
the opportunity to really be humble, but

00:15:25.589 --> 00:15:30.600
he wasn't, he was worried more about how
he was perceived in front of these guys.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.689
And so let's look a little
bit deeper at this, right?

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.439
When we think about it, we
think about when pride and

00:15:37.439 --> 00:15:39.300
selfishness comes up in our life.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:39.780
Right?

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:40.730
What does it lead us?

00:15:41.865 --> 00:15:45.825
It leads us to become numb to
what's important to God and become

00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:47.295
focused on what's important to us.

00:15:47.325 --> 00:15:47.985
What is that?

00:15:48.255 --> 00:15:54.045
It's selfishness at times we want to
look better than we are rather than.

00:15:55.095 --> 00:15:57.915
Be humble in front of
people and actually broken.

00:15:58.515 --> 00:16:01.455
One of the conversations that
we had yesterday with the w with

00:16:01.455 --> 00:16:05.535
the lady was this idea behind
everybody is broken in some form.

00:16:05.535 --> 00:16:08.085
We're all dealing with
brokenness and struggle, and

00:16:08.085 --> 00:16:09.285
we're here to help one another.

00:16:09.315 --> 00:16:11.475
We're not here to look like
we have it all together.

00:16:11.475 --> 00:16:14.085
We're here to say that we are in
a desperate need for the Lord.

00:16:14.685 --> 00:16:18.285
And yet Jonah refused to
show that the he needed help.

00:16:19.065 --> 00:16:20.295
And so how do we respond?

00:16:20.295 --> 00:16:21.105
Let me ask this question.

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:22.185
How do you respond?

00:16:23.219 --> 00:16:24.420
Um, and be honest with this.

00:16:24.449 --> 00:16:27.449
When somebody calls you out for
maybe a sin in your life or for

00:16:27.449 --> 00:16:29.250
a fault, how do you respond?

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:35.569
Cause I know how I respond,
anger being defensive.

00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:36.349
I don't ever do that.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.579
I don't ever do that.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.630
What else?

00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:42.709
Anybody else respond?

00:16:42.859 --> 00:16:44.150
Somebody respond with grace.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.930
Like thank you.

00:16:48.229 --> 00:16:50.910
Why, why don't we respond with.

00:16:55.855 --> 00:16:56.454
What was that?

00:16:57.775 --> 00:17:02.185
We don't want to admit our faults
because we're very selfish minded.

00:17:02.185 --> 00:17:03.444
We're going to defend ourselves.

00:17:04.045 --> 00:17:05.244
It's all about us.

00:17:05.935 --> 00:17:09.474
And it's about my feelings and it's about
what, you know, and, and we begin to

00:17:09.474 --> 00:17:15.535
want to protect our image or justify our,
how we act and, and trust me guys, I am.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:20.490
The I struggled with this same
thing, but it's how we respond

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.500
though, because I think these are
the moments is there's times where

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.040
we respond in very like anger, right?

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.160
We respond in such a way that we're
wanting to just justify ourselves.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.240
But when conviction reigns over,
there is many times where, like

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.870
me and Brittany usually we'll have
this conflict within the marriage.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:37.140
Right.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:42.060
One of us will point out something else
and we have to come back and apologize.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:43.950
Hey, I hear you now.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.970
Do we do it every time?

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:46.560
We should we?

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:52.050
Yeah, but even Jonah, it just took so
long for him to recognize his faults.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.500
And even whenever he did, we're going to
see where it seemed to be limited on this.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.800
But when obviously we get called
out for things, a lot of times we

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.120
want to justify ourselves, right.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.070
We begin to attack others.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.710
If you're anything like me, you
also, if somebody calls you out

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.520
about one thing, you're going to
find whatever fault they have and

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.450
you're going to call it out on them.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.370
See, we like to attack.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.280
But God's not called us to do that.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.320
He has called us to be humble.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.430
And this is the part about church is
that we should, when I say church as

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.250
a church, we should be able to be a
part of each other's lives, right.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.650
And speak truth into each other's
lives and actually hear it.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.480
Um, and, and, and this is where I hope
we get to, as a church, we continue

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.100
to get to that place as a church.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:32.550
Right.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.850
So as we see this really Jay Jonah just
kind of finished up these couple verses.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.970
Jonah seemed to be claiming, you
know, Hey, I'm, I'm a Christian.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.020
I follow God personally.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.320
Who were you?

00:18:41.685 --> 00:18:43.245
Um, and so he was prideful in that.

00:18:43.245 --> 00:18:44.145
So we see this right.

00:18:44.145 --> 00:18:48.315
Self-centered living will always catch
up to us, but self-centered living really

00:18:48.315 --> 00:18:50.925
causes us to avoid our responsibilities.

00:18:51.555 --> 00:18:56.355
Um, because we don't want to
be the one that's at fault.

00:18:56.505 --> 00:18:57.195
We don't want to be.

00:18:57.195 --> 00:18:59.145
And we're going to see
this right in verse 10.

00:18:59.475 --> 00:19:00.255
This is what Jonah says.

00:19:00.255 --> 00:19:03.915
It says in the middle men were
seized with great fear and said to

00:19:03.915 --> 00:19:06.105
him, what is this you've done for?

00:19:06.105 --> 00:19:09.015
The men knew he was fleeing the Lord's
presence because he had told them.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:14.190
Did you notice that Jonah, at that
again at, at this point Jonah's

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.900
still, hasn't taken responsibility.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.370
He's he's given his title is given
who he follows, you know, all these

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:24.870
things, but he has still not taken
responsibility for what they asked

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.640
whose fault it was until later.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.230
But the way that the resellers are
spawned in great fear at the moment that

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.970
he says who he follows, do you notice
that that Jonah's become numb to it?

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.250
And it doesn't say Jonah was fearful.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.280
And it says the sellers were fearful.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.230
It seems opposite, but I'll go
back to this as followers of Jesus.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.950
At times we can become numb
to the fear of the Lord.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:50.430
No.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.470
Now Ben, should we be fearful to the Lord?

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:53.130
Doesn't he love us?

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:53.880
Absolutely.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.290
The fear is the understand of his
position and control over our lives.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.830
Not as fear as though he scared.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.280
Okay.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.430
And I think that's the hard part when
we look at this and there's a, there's

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.700
a verse that talks about the fear of
the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.920
And these men obviously showed
that wisdom, but yet Jonah

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.210
did not show that wisdom.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.420
So they responded the way I believe
that Jonah would have responded.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:18.600
Right.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.649
So they said, what have you done?

00:20:19.649 --> 00:20:19.950
Right.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.050
So the moment they realized
that Jonah could have prevented

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.770
them from, um, obviously all the
destruction that they're dealing.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.640
But as we look at this, the
verse 11 is so key with this.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.700
If you look at the last part of parcel
of it, so it says, so he said to them,

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.970
or they said to him, what should we do
so that the sea will calm down for us and

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:37.590
says the sea was getting worse and worse.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.950
And so this is the moment, the
more that Jonah rejected the

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.560
Lord, the more the sea got worse.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.520
So I'm just taking life
application from the word.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.710
The more that I reject the Lord.

00:20:50.895 --> 00:20:54.165
The more storms, the more things
will come into my life that will

00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:56.355
be trying to draw me back to him.

00:20:56.504 --> 00:21:02.715
And so those are those moments where
don't wait, don't keep rejecting the Lord

00:21:03.165 --> 00:21:05.205
because he is wanting to bring you back.

00:21:05.235 --> 00:21:07.155
He's wanting to draw you back
to repentance, or maybe he's

00:21:07.155 --> 00:21:08.445
wanting to draw you to him.

00:21:09.165 --> 00:21:12.735
And so we understand based on Jonah's
story, that this is what God does, right.

00:21:12.735 --> 00:21:15.465
He allows these storms to get
worse in our life, maybe to test

00:21:15.465 --> 00:21:16.905
us or to draw us back to him.

00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:19.514
But verse 12 is really an interesting.

00:21:20.205 --> 00:21:21.375
Verse when we look at this.

00:21:21.804 --> 00:21:25.544
So J Jonah answered their question and it
says, throw me into the sea so that the

00:21:25.544 --> 00:21:27.915
storm will calm down for me or for you.

00:21:27.915 --> 00:21:30.254
Excuse me for, I know I am to blame.

00:21:30.254 --> 00:21:34.395
So finally, Jonah admits
he takes ownership.

00:21:34.455 --> 00:21:37.965
I'm the one to blame for everything
you're in, throw me into the ocean,

00:21:38.745 --> 00:21:41.024
but there's a couple of things that
I don't want you to miss on this.

00:21:41.895 --> 00:21:44.595
He said, you throw me into the ocean.

00:21:45.735 --> 00:21:47.264
Somebody tell me what he could have been.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.250
I get a jumped in the ocean.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.150
Why do you think he wanted them to throw
now again, we can go with the fear side

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.750
because he was afraid scared to throw,
but why else do you think maybe he

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:00.090
didn't want to be thrown off into the
air, throw himself off in the ocean.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.310
Just jump off anybody.

00:22:07.265 --> 00:22:11.195
So think about this for Jonah to
throw himself off and to kill himself,

00:22:11.195 --> 00:22:14.495
especially from a believer standpoint
would be a negative thing, right?

00:22:14.495 --> 00:22:17.555
He killed himself, but if somebody
throws me off, they murdered me.

00:22:18.125 --> 00:22:18.995
It's going to seem better.

00:22:18.995 --> 00:22:19.385
It's going to look.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:20.820
Right.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.340
He's he's passing the buck
is what he's really doing.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:24.780
And here's the thing.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:29.190
When we think about this he's
avoiding responsibility yet again,

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.140
he has the ability to repent.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.070
He has the ability to jump off himself
and he refuses to take responsibility

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:36.720
and the places on somebody else to do it.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.360
Oh man, that's tough.

00:22:40.825 --> 00:22:42.865
I don't know if you've ever
placed responsibility on somebody

00:22:42.865 --> 00:22:44.515
else to step up to the plate.

00:22:45.055 --> 00:22:48.415
Um, but when you do that, maybe if it's
in your home, whenever you're, you're put

00:22:48.415 --> 00:22:51.445
place in your spouse in that situation,
maybe it's somebody at work where you're,

00:22:51.575 --> 00:22:54.475
you're forgetting your responsibilities
and you're just letting them take it on.

00:22:54.505 --> 00:22:58.495
It is a bad position to be in,
especially as a believer to do that.

00:22:59.125 --> 00:23:00.205
Here's what I would say.

00:23:00.625 --> 00:23:02.755
When we look at this, there's a
couple of things when I think about

00:23:02.755 --> 00:23:08.155
this thrown off, right, is that he
definitely could have just jumped off.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.909
But when we think about him
asking him to throw an off, he

00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:13.740
didn't care for the sellers.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.620
Again, he didn't care when he got
on the boat to invite them into the

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.090
storms that God had in his life.

00:23:18.449 --> 00:23:20.399
And he didn't help them.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.490
He was actually saying, Hey, if
you throw me off, it'd be murder.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.340
Maybe the Lord will punish
them for throwing them off.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.860
Now you'll see them later, ask the Lord
not to punish them, but he was willing

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.949
to risk their lives so that his life.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.330
Would be saved or his life would
not go out the way that maybe

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.139
he thought it was negative.

00:23:40.139 --> 00:23:42.840
And it's interesting how we
invite people in to some of

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.580
our crazy situations like that.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.840
But there's a second thing.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.080
Right?

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.399
The great storm said, he says the
storm had calmed down for you store.

00:23:50.699 --> 00:23:53.159
That was interesting with
Jonah, Jonah understood.

00:23:53.219 --> 00:23:54.149
At least at this moment.

00:23:54.945 --> 00:23:58.065
He was not saying the storm will slow
down for me or to come down for me.

00:23:58.335 --> 00:24:03.345
He didn't care about his situation,
anybody or anybody ever got to a point

00:24:03.345 --> 00:24:05.715
in your life where you really just
feel like that you're not worthy.

00:24:06.765 --> 00:24:07.935
You're just like, you're no good.

00:24:08.265 --> 00:24:10.665
You can't be, you can't
come back from this.

00:24:11.055 --> 00:24:13.455
Maybe that was the moment
that Jonah was at, right.

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:16.155
Maybe Jonah just felt like
he can't come back from this.

00:24:16.155 --> 00:24:20.775
Maybe he had ran too far from God
and that he knew that there was

00:24:20.775 --> 00:24:22.035
no way this storm would interrupt.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.640
See, I, I think about this as this is
an important part for us, because I

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.870
had to kind of stop and think through
this, we are God's greatest creation.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.170
And when God is bringing us
through a storm, if we wonder if

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.880
God loves us and if God would ever
take us back, the answer is 100%.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.390
Yes.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.590
He already said yes, that he would
forgive you of your sins and it

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.220
would bring you back in and he would
use you to give you that first rate

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.290
life that God has planned for you.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.300
He would guide you in.

00:24:51.105 --> 00:24:53.325
But too many times, we're
like Jonah, we've given up,

00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:54.705
just throw me into the ocean.

00:24:55.035 --> 00:24:56.055
Your life will be saved.

00:24:56.085 --> 00:24:57.195
I don't know about mine.

00:24:57.255 --> 00:24:58.335
I don't know what God will do.

00:24:59.025 --> 00:25:02.655
We can have the confidence to know our
God loves us and that he will always

00:25:02.655 --> 00:25:04.725
forgive us if we'll just admit it.

00:25:05.115 --> 00:25:07.125
And that was the one
thing that Jonah refused.

00:25:07.665 --> 00:25:11.085
He refused to take responsibility
for this circumstance.

00:25:11.625 --> 00:25:13.065
And I think that is so tough.

00:25:16.415 --> 00:25:17.615
So, let me ask this question.

00:25:17.615 --> 00:25:21.275
So whenever we're in the storms of our
life, maybe we're struggling with St.

00:25:21.275 --> 00:25:24.995
Things maybe we're struggling with, with
maybe God's trying to change our minds

00:25:24.995 --> 00:25:26.915
and some different areas of our lives.

00:25:27.365 --> 00:25:32.495
Um, and you just want to give up what
are some things that we can do to

00:25:32.705 --> 00:25:35.795
overcome this way that we feel, what
are some things that we can do to

00:25:35.795 --> 00:25:41.105
overcome the ways that we feel about
maybe being too far out, too far away

00:25:41.105 --> 00:25:42.555
from God that we can't be forgiven.

00:25:46.895 --> 00:25:47.375
Repin.

00:25:47.435 --> 00:25:47.764
Okay.

00:25:47.794 --> 00:25:48.635
Yes, absolutely.

00:25:48.635 --> 00:25:49.565
That's a great start.

00:25:51.615 --> 00:25:53.655
What if you don't feel like you're
strong enough to figure it out?

00:25:53.655 --> 00:25:54.315
What should you do?

00:25:59.875 --> 00:26:03.235
Ask for help too many times.

00:26:03.235 --> 00:26:04.135
We're too prideful.

00:26:05.605 --> 00:26:09.024
We don't want to admit that we're broken
and we don't know how to figure it out.

00:26:09.745 --> 00:26:12.385
Your greatest response should be.

00:26:13.754 --> 00:26:17.385
And the cool part is who we
are as a church is to say,

00:26:17.385 --> 00:26:19.004
this is a place to say help.

00:26:19.935 --> 00:26:20.925
I don't know what to do.

00:26:21.435 --> 00:26:22.844
I don't know how to repent.

00:26:23.115 --> 00:26:24.945
I don't know how to overcome my pride.

00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:26.804
I don't know how to take responsibility.

00:26:26.834 --> 00:26:27.524
It's okay.

00:26:27.735 --> 00:26:30.584
And then you can have somebody come
alongside you and say, I've been there.

00:26:31.365 --> 00:26:32.054
Let me help you.

00:26:32.054 --> 00:26:33.195
Let's take the word of God.

00:26:33.195 --> 00:26:34.485
Let's take the grace of God.

00:26:34.844 --> 00:26:37.365
Let's take the prayer that we
have and the encouragement that

00:26:37.365 --> 00:26:39.375
we have to help you overcome this.

00:26:39.584 --> 00:26:41.115
Don't fight your battles.

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:43.450
I don't find them alone.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.140
And in this whole story, you're
going to see Jonah obviously had the

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.870
presence of God, but yet he rejected
that, but he didn't have the presence

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.670
of people around him to support him.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:56.170
And that's what I love is that when
we are dealing with maybe times where

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:58.840
we're rejecting, what the Lord's
called us to do, we have people

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.670
around us to encourage us back to it.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:02.560
Don't miss that part.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.530
So self centered living will
always catch up to us, right.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.900
It'll causes us to avoid our
responsibilities, but this

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.960
last part I think is so.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.730
So I want you to lean in on this self
centered living will, will really cause

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:19.890
us to miss out on God's plan to save the
lost, to save those who don't know Jesus.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:25.290
When we live a self-centered life, we
miss out on being a part of God's big

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.950
story of redeeming people, bringing people
back to him, to relationship with him.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.780
And you may say, well, gotta use somebody
else, any, he will because that's

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.400
who God is because he has a plan, but
he's also had a plan that you would.

00:27:38.885 --> 00:27:42.515
But we reject it because we're
just, we're too uncomfortable.

00:27:42.545 --> 00:27:44.525
You know, I think about what
the coders are doing, right?

00:27:44.525 --> 00:27:47.075
They're going with the business to start
this group and they could have easily

00:27:47.075 --> 00:27:50.555
said, you know, what's more comfortable
to come and just be more of a participant

00:27:50.555 --> 00:27:55.385
than more of a leader of a group, but
they're like, no, we want to step out of

00:27:55.385 --> 00:28:00.365
our comfort zone and be a part of this
first rate life that God has for us.

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:02.765
See, God's inviting us
all into those stories.

00:28:02.765 --> 00:28:04.805
And so where do we see
this with Jonah's story?

00:28:04.805 --> 00:28:05.675
Let's look at verse 30.

00:28:07.419 --> 00:28:12.010
Um, and so it says this, nevertheless,
the men rode harder to get back to dry

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:15.219
land, but they couldn't because the sea
was raging against them more and more.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.040
There's something missing here.

00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:24.489
These men, the sellers, people who
didn't know God at all, because they had

00:28:24.489 --> 00:28:26.199
gods, they worshiped were not one true.

00:28:26.199 --> 00:28:29.199
God had more compassion than Jonah.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.229
See, they were rowing as hard as
they could to save Jonah's life

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.090
because they knew if we throw them
off the ship, there's a good chance.

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:34.270
He's got.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.030
But, you know, one things I don't see in
here, I don't see Jonah grabbing a, an

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.310
Oren rowing to try to save their lives.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.980
Jonah missed out on an opportunity
to save, to, to really show

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.960
the true colors of who God is.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.110
It's amazing that they did that.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.440
Right.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.180
But, but Jonah could've and so he
was supposed to be the one trying

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.560
to save them from eternal death.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.170
And he's sitting on the
sidelines avoiding this.

00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:05.745
Anybody ever had that moment where you
saw God moment to be able to speak truth

00:29:05.745 --> 00:29:09.794
into someone's life or share the love
of Jesus and you walked away, anybody

00:29:09.794 --> 00:29:11.235
ever feel defeated when you walked away?

00:29:11.865 --> 00:29:12.375
I've been there.

00:29:13.125 --> 00:29:13.995
I have been there.

00:29:14.264 --> 00:29:16.725
And it's that moment where I
think like, I w like, why did,

00:29:16.845 --> 00:29:19.034
is did Jonah fill that to Jonah?

00:29:19.034 --> 00:29:22.215
Feel like, man, I'm really
missed the boat literally, but

00:29:22.215 --> 00:29:23.685
like, did he miss the wrong way?

00:29:23.715 --> 00:29:24.435
Like, what did he do?

00:29:26.169 --> 00:29:26.929
I don't know.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:30.620
And I see this, if we look at the end
of this verse, as well as the, and the

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:34.310
sea was raging against them, more and
more what's happening, somebody give

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:35.870
me the what's happening to the storm.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.030
It's getting worse.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:44.600
So, you know, as you begin to continually
reject the Lord, he will bring more

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.709
and more things into your life.

00:29:45.739 --> 00:29:48.919
As a child of God, he will do this
more and more things in your life to

00:29:48.919 --> 00:29:52.879
bring you back to him, to recognize
that's not the place he has.

00:29:54.675 --> 00:29:57.075
And, you know, you may be asking
the question, how, what does he use?

00:29:57.075 --> 00:30:00.285
He uses people, circumstances and storms.

00:30:00.735 --> 00:30:02.115
If you're here today.

00:30:02.115 --> 00:30:04.665
And you're wondering, man, God, I
actually, my life's pretty good right now.

00:30:04.665 --> 00:30:05.865
What, what storm could it be?

00:30:06.165 --> 00:30:09.555
You know, maybe it's just this message
that God's given you the ability to

00:30:09.555 --> 00:30:13.515
hear this message today, the word of
God today that you needed to hear.

00:30:13.754 --> 00:30:14.835
Don't wait on the storm.

00:30:15.254 --> 00:30:16.125
I keep saying this.

00:30:16.635 --> 00:30:20.565
I don't want to wait on the fish
to have to swallow me to get

00:30:20.565 --> 00:30:21.465
the point of what God speaks.

00:30:22.125 --> 00:30:22.965
That sounds scary.

00:30:22.965 --> 00:30:23.445
I don't want it.

00:30:24.135 --> 00:30:26.535
I want to deal with whatever
God's called me to do today.

00:30:27.555 --> 00:30:32.835
And so as we look at this, um, verse
14, let's just continue on verse 14.

00:30:32.835 --> 00:30:36.525
It says, um, so they called out to
the Lord, please, Lord, don't let us

00:30:36.525 --> 00:30:38.115
perish because of this man's life.

00:30:38.145 --> 00:30:40.575
And don't charge us for
as innocent blood for you.

00:30:40.575 --> 00:30:42.345
Lord have done just as you please.

00:30:43.095 --> 00:30:47.535
So now we see an opportunity
for Jonah to step up and.

00:30:49.405 --> 00:30:50.335
But who does it first?

00:30:50.335 --> 00:30:51.235
It's the sailors.

00:30:51.475 --> 00:30:56.065
They recognize their need for God's to
forgive them and to not judge them for

00:30:56.065 --> 00:30:57.415
the sin that they're getting ready.

00:30:57.415 --> 00:30:59.905
They feel like that maybe they're
committing by throwing them off there.

00:31:00.025 --> 00:31:03.355
So they're asking God to forgive them.

00:31:03.415 --> 00:31:05.185
Don't cause this to go against them.

00:31:05.185 --> 00:31:05.395
Right.

00:31:05.395 --> 00:31:07.495
They recognize the
significance of this moment.

00:31:08.575 --> 00:31:10.975
And Jonah was too
prideful to ask for help.

00:31:11.305 --> 00:31:12.405
He missed an opportunity.

00:31:13.665 --> 00:31:14.685
So I made that statement.

00:31:14.685 --> 00:31:17.055
Proverbs 16, 18 pride comes
before the destruction and

00:31:17.055 --> 00:31:18.405
arrogant spirit before the fall.

00:31:18.615 --> 00:31:21.345
If you're sitting in this room right
now, and you're having a prideful moment

00:31:21.345 --> 00:31:26.835
because you don't want to be called out,
you don't want to admit that you need God.

00:31:28.034 --> 00:31:31.455
Be clear that the word says the
F uh, that, that we understand

00:31:31.455 --> 00:31:33.135
that pride comes before the fall.

00:31:33.465 --> 00:31:37.305
When we are too prideful
to ask God to forgive us.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.870
And so they came to the conclusion, right?

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.760
That it was the will of
God to, to throw them off.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.750
And so they threw them off, right.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:45.870
They finally threw them off, throw
them off and the storm stops.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:46.740
And here here's the thing.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.580
I would assume this, this thought
somebody who doesn't follow the Lord,

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.050
obviously they saw a lot of God moments
in this, but the storm stops when

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.430
they just go back to the normal life.

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:57.000
I'm great.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:57.720
The storm stopped.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.950
Let's just keep on going.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:02.220
You know, we're going to keep on going
on a better life, but they didn't,

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.920
again, they recognize that the Lord.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.790
Was was who he was and
that they feared him.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.630
And it says that they, if you look
at verse 15, it says, then they

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:16.530
picked up, Jonah threw him into
the sea and the sea stopped raging.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.520
And the men were seized with great fear
and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:26.280
So they did not miss the opportunity
to really worship the Lord.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.180
That was that sacrifice.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.110
They worshiped the Lord.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:32.190
They thank the Lord for saving
them and to not casting that

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:33.600
judgment, a thrown donut off again.

00:32:34.985 --> 00:32:36.665
C Jonah could have been
a part of their story.

00:32:37.565 --> 00:32:38.705
Jonah could have been
a part of their story.

00:32:38.705 --> 00:32:42.035
So let me share a different
version of this story that I

00:32:42.035 --> 00:32:43.355
think could have been Jonah story.

00:32:43.505 --> 00:32:46.355
The book of Jonah would have been
a lot shorter, but here's what I

00:32:46.355 --> 00:32:47.405
think the story could have been.

00:32:47.675 --> 00:32:49.115
You get to verse six, right?

00:32:49.295 --> 00:32:53.075
The captain comes into Jonah, Jonah,
Jonah, get up, call out to your God.

00:32:53.075 --> 00:32:56.315
Maybe he will basically save us.

00:32:57.365 --> 00:32:58.505
And here's what Jonah did again.

00:32:58.505 --> 00:32:59.675
I'm giving you the alternate version.

00:33:00.125 --> 00:33:02.165
Jonah gets up and he gets on his knees.

00:33:02.195 --> 00:33:03.395
God forgive me of my sin.

00:33:04.515 --> 00:33:07.035
I recognize I shouldn't have ran from you.

00:33:07.035 --> 00:33:08.595
I'll go to the people of Nineveh.

00:33:08.655 --> 00:33:09.645
Please save us.

00:33:10.365 --> 00:33:14.565
And the storm stops and those
sellers and that captain goes Jonah.

00:33:14.565 --> 00:33:14.895
Jonah.

00:33:14.925 --> 00:33:15.975
Thank you so much.

00:33:16.575 --> 00:33:19.575
We know that the God you
serve is the one true God.

00:33:20.385 --> 00:33:21.765
Let's worship him together.

00:33:21.945 --> 00:33:25.575
Let's offer sacrifices of Thanksgiving
to the Lord and let's turn the ship

00:33:25.575 --> 00:33:27.405
around to get you back to Nineveh.

00:33:27.945 --> 00:33:29.205
See that could have been the story of.

00:33:30.504 --> 00:33:32.695
But there's so much more of
the story because of Jonah's

00:33:32.695 --> 00:33:37.524
rejection, wrong attitude, second
rate, living, selfish mentality.

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:40.495
And I don't know if any of this
reigns in your heart or mind at

00:33:40.495 --> 00:33:46.105
times, and you struggle with this,
but God had a better path for Jonah

00:33:46.135 --> 00:33:48.115
and he chose the wrong direction.

00:33:48.264 --> 00:33:51.835
Now we'll get into the story where
Jonah now is eaten by this big fish.

00:33:51.835 --> 00:33:55.195
And there's a big, long list of
repentance and things like that.

00:33:55.195 --> 00:33:57.625
That we'll see that finally
led Jonas to repentance.

00:33:58.514 --> 00:34:01.875
But man, guys, I don't think we need
to wait for a fish to swallow us.

00:34:02.084 --> 00:34:03.254
I know that's just a relative term.

00:34:03.284 --> 00:34:04.365
Just don't go to the ocean I guess.

00:34:04.365 --> 00:34:10.154
But you know, there's something that
maybe God will use to, to, to bring

00:34:10.154 --> 00:34:13.545
you back to him onto the life and the
path that he's called you to live.

00:34:14.665 --> 00:34:17.804
I, one of the things that I, as I
become a believer and I feel like I've

00:34:17.804 --> 00:34:21.194
lived this, this, this way since I
become a believer and maybe it's just

00:34:21.194 --> 00:34:25.364
everything that I was saved out of,
I keep praying God don't let me miss.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:31.139
What you have designed me for
like, don't let me miss out on

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.540
your God designed opportunities.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:34.290
Have I at times?

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:35.130
Absolutely.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:39.330
But it seems like every time I ask that
the Lord gives me another opportunity

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:41.790
to say yes, in a tough situation.

00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:46.800
And I know this, I've got to see
so many people come to faith in

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:52.740
Christ, start following Jesus because
I've chose his ways over my way.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:55.520
Now there's going to be a
little bit more of this.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.420
So let's look at this.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:56.600
Right?

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:01.279
So instead of Jonah being a part of
right, the salvation stories of these

00:35:01.279 --> 00:35:02.569
sellers, he wasn't a part of that.

00:35:02.569 --> 00:35:02.899
Right?

00:35:03.859 --> 00:35:06.830
So instead of living, maybe the story that
I shared with you, the alternate story,

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.379
he's now going to be swallowed by a fish.

00:35:10.009 --> 00:35:15.230
So Jonah chose a self-centered life,
which caught up to him because he avoided

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:19.399
taking responsibility because he missed
out on the God's plan to say the law.

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:21.420
At least on this boat.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.760
And I know you guys are gonna be like,
Hey, down the road, he actually goes

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.900
and preaches and innovate repents, but
he still missed out on celebrating.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.500
He still missed out on
a huge part of that.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:31.080
So I thought I started thinking
about this Ephesians five.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:31.920
One says this.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:37.500
He says, imitate God, therefore as
dearly loved children, does anybody

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.740
know if you've studied enough
about Jesus that did Jesus lives?

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:43.050
Self-centered no.

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.710
He said lifts selfless so
much so that he gave his life.

00:35:47.865 --> 00:35:52.395
And for me, and he gave his
life for us so that we could

00:35:52.395 --> 00:35:55.995
have life to go live for him.

00:35:57.315 --> 00:36:00.315
And I think about that, that,
that God has given us each the

00:36:00.315 --> 00:36:03.135
opportunity to live a life for him.

00:36:03.945 --> 00:36:05.085
And what's good for us.

00:36:05.505 --> 00:36:05.805
Right.

00:36:06.585 --> 00:36:10.605
And so I, you know, one of my favorite
verses it says, you know, pick up your

00:36:10.605 --> 00:36:13.725
cross daily, deny yourself and follow him.

00:36:14.775 --> 00:36:16.815
And it's that idea that
every day it's a choice.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.490
To say no to self and say yes to
Jesus to be a part of his plan.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:22.200
So now this is the question.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.660
Does my life have to suck?

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.890
I remember thinking this, I know this
may be straightforward, but I remember

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.500
thinking this when I was going to give
my life to Jesus, I was like, but now

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.640
I'm going to go live a boring life.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.650
And you know, it's not
going to be fun anymore.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.190
I don't get to do this and
I don't get to do that.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.930
And I'll get to do that.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:39.780
And I walked through that for a solid
year until I came to a realization.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.870
That alive, lived out a first rate.

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:45.030
Life lived out a selfless
life, lived out for Jesus.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:51.120
Jesus's way better than a selfish life
lived out from me, way better, guaranteed.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.740
And so I want you to know this, that we
are choosing to live a second rate life.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.960
When we choose to live a selfish life.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.740
When we start living, how
God has called us, we start

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.540
experiencing fulfilling moments.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:07.800
We start seeing life change, not only in
ourselves, but in other people, we start,

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.330
start liking ourselves a little bit more.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:13.470
We start really understanding how much
control we don't have in situations

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.000
and how much control God does have.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:21.330
We begin to have more peace, hope, faith,
love more grace and mercy in our lives.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.570
We begin to see God at
work in everything we do.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.260
Wow.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.690
I'm telling you the first rate
life's way better than a selfish.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:30.700
Here's the question what's stopping you.

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.520
I mean, is it, is it a self-centered life?

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.090
Is it a wrong attitude like
Jonah was dealing with?

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:41.420
Um, I don't know what it is for you.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.670
Maybe you just, haven't
given your life to Jesus.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.340
Maybe you haven't fully
surrendered your life and said,

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.950
Lord, I'm yours, no conditions.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:51.080
And maybe that's you today.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:55.730
And if that is you today, I don't want
to extend this to you that you can

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:56.870
know the Lord before you leave today.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.080
There's no, there's nothing
stopping you from knowing the

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.460
Lord and giving your life to him.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:06.750
And now beginning to live the life that
he's called you to live outside of the

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:11.520
same thing that Jonah had, the opportunity
you lay down your pride and you recognize

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.570
your need and you repent and you ask
God to live inside you and help you

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:16.620
live the life he's called you to live.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:17.010
That's it.

00:38:20.375 --> 00:38:21.695
So during this time of invitation.

00:38:21.695 --> 00:38:22.775
So here's what we have every week.

00:38:22.775 --> 00:38:23.735
I was talking about invitation.

00:38:23.735 --> 00:38:27.095
What is invitation, invitations,
and opportunity to consider all

00:38:27.095 --> 00:38:28.955
that God shared with you today.

00:38:28.985 --> 00:38:33.395
And so I've found this in most
settings, whenever a pastor preaches,

00:38:34.355 --> 00:38:36.815
every person in the room could go
out and write down what they heard.

00:38:36.815 --> 00:38:40.715
And God told those 10 people, 10
different things, because God spoke

00:38:40.715 --> 00:38:42.245
to you directly through this message.

00:38:43.135 --> 00:38:45.335
So I just would encourage you this
during this time of invitation.

00:38:46.424 --> 00:38:48.225
Maybe God has called you to do something.

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:51.225
I don't know if it's to, to, to
change something in your life, to

00:38:51.225 --> 00:38:52.545
repent in an area of your life.

00:38:52.545 --> 00:38:54.105
And to begin to walk in faith.

00:38:54.705 --> 00:38:59.145
I don't know if it is to give your
life to him and if it is, what is your

00:38:59.145 --> 00:39:01.845
next step, everybody has a next step
in this room, but what is your next

00:39:01.845 --> 00:39:03.585
step and giving your life to Jesus.

00:39:04.904 --> 00:39:06.615
It is just admitting that you need him.

00:39:06.795 --> 00:39:08.745
And so during time of
invitation, this is what I do.

00:39:08.745 --> 00:39:09.734
I stayed in the back.

00:39:09.795 --> 00:39:12.645
I don't have my mic on, so, you
know, but I stayed in the back and I.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:16.440
Counsel with people, anybody that
has conversation questions about

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.310
the, the message to questions
about salvation, to questions about

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:23.580
what does it mean to overcome some
storms in your life, whatever it

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.560
is, I'm here to walk alongside you.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.339
And really honestly, all of us are,
but I want to be there for you.

00:39:29.339 --> 00:39:30.900
So during time of
invitation, come talk to me.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:31.980
Maybe it's right after service.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.290
You come talk to me,
but don't leave today.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:37.500
If the Lord is leading you to consider
what it means to follow him and to

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.790
live the life that he's called for you.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:41.609
But if you've given your life
to Jesus, this is my last point.

00:39:41.609 --> 00:39:42.330
If you've given your life to.

00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:48.540
Don't miss the opportunity today to
lay down, whatever is holding you back

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:52.680
from living the life he's called you
to, maybe it is a self-centered life.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:53.790
You've just got to give it up.

00:39:53.819 --> 00:39:54.630
It's not about you.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:56.279
It's not about me now.

00:39:56.549 --> 00:39:57.180
Here's the thing.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.910
You could lay it down today and
tomorrow you can pick it back up

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.799
and that's what too many of us do.

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:03.390
Lay it down today.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.509
And then when you wake up tomorrow,
ask the Lord to help you lay

00:40:06.509 --> 00:40:10.200
down again, invite somebody into
your life to help you later.

00:40:11.835 --> 00:40:14.055
And then you get to begin to
see God move in your life.

00:40:14.085 --> 00:40:15.465
Like you've never seen before.

00:40:16.485 --> 00:40:18.765
So I'm going to pray and
we'll stand in worship.

00:40:19.275 --> 00:40:22.575
And then, um, just take some time
to consider what God's taught you.

00:40:22.585 --> 00:40:23.925
Lord Jesus, we love you.

00:40:24.585 --> 00:40:28.965
And Lord, we're thankful for
you that your word is truth.

00:40:28.995 --> 00:40:33.495
And that Lord today, I pray Lord
that the, the example of Jonah

00:40:33.495 --> 00:40:37.545
Lord, maybe in a negative way,
Lord is maybe teaching us, um, Lord

00:40:37.545 --> 00:40:38.654
that maybe we're seeing ourselves.

00:40:39.705 --> 00:40:44.145
And this story way too much, Lord, we're
seeing ourselves live a self-centered

00:40:44.145 --> 00:40:50.925
life, a life that only worries about
us and not even about your will and

00:40:50.925 --> 00:40:55.035
your, your purpose in our lives to
help others experience your hope.

00:40:57.585 --> 00:41:02.445
So, Lord, I just pray that today, each one
of us considers maybe what you're drawing

00:41:02.445 --> 00:41:05.015
out of us Lord to change about our lives.

00:41:05.025 --> 00:41:05.175
Lord.

00:41:06.675 --> 00:41:09.945
Or the, the thing that I worry so much
about, and I guess I shouldn't worry Lori,

00:41:09.945 --> 00:41:13.755
because you're in control, but that too
many of us are working for our salvation.

00:41:14.595 --> 00:41:19.545
And what that means, Lord, I just know
that is, is that you would never have

00:41:19.545 --> 00:41:23.835
us work for our salvation because it's
already been done on the cross Lord.

00:41:23.835 --> 00:41:29.865
You gave your life so that we could live
a life full of freedom and forgiveness.

00:41:31.245 --> 00:41:34.785
So Lord help us know today, Lord, that
the weight maybe that we feel of not

00:41:34.785 --> 00:41:38.745
living the life that you've called us
to Lord is not ours to be, to really

00:41:38.745 --> 00:41:40.424
carry Lord, but it's yours to carry.

00:41:41.085 --> 00:41:44.055
And Lord that today, as we surrender
Lord, that you will pick us up,

00:41:44.595 --> 00:41:50.475
dust us off and use us to help reach
those in our lives to know you.

00:41:52.245 --> 00:41:54.795
And so Lord, we love you and we
pray this in your heavenly name.
