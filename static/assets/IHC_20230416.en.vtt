00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640
But in the midst of seeking the Lord about what series we would do next, God brought


00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.720
this to my heart to talk about, and it's this idea of perfect peace.


00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.720
Perfect peace.


00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.160
And if you study this a little bit, I think it's in the Hebrew language, it's shalom shalom.


00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.200
And when you begin to study a little bit more of God's perfect peace, it's amazing to see


00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.200
how God provides that perfect peace.


00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.380
When I started even diving a little more into that,


00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.320
I started diving into the idea behind,


00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.820
just the idea of the struggle in the world


00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.120
and in our lives with mental health,


00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.380
dealing with anxiety, depression, worry,


00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.920
negative thoughts, trauma, you name it,


00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.260
things like that that we have dealt with in our society


00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.180
that we may deal with in the church.


00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.980
And one of the things that I've learned is,


00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.000
even as I have personally experienced this,


00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.120
as you'll hear some of my story today,


00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.280
it's what we call is it's hard to talk about these subjects,


00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.760
especially as believers, because this is what we assume.


00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.860
Should we have these struggles if we're a follower of Jesus?


00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.040
Should we have mental struggles if we're a follower of Jesus?


00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.440
And I hope to answer that question today for you


00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.960
if that helps you at all.


00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.120
And so we're going to dive off into this,


00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.040
not by my personal gifting, if that makes sense.


00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.640
I'm gonna give you the spiritual side of it,


00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.520
but I have been following for a while


00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.520
a church that walked through a series similar to this,


00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.660
and they have shared resources to give me


00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.640
the side of the things that I don't have, right?


00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.300
It's the, what I would say, the medical,


00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.680
the psychological side of the things


00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.800
that can help us in the process of figuring out


00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.160
how to walk through this also as well as spiritual.


00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.080
So it's not only on me, don't just look at this


00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.920
and say, "Hey, Ben should know what he's talking about."


00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.260
I don't fully know what I'm talking about,


00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.040
but I do know the Lord and I know people who are,


00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.160
and so I'm using their resources to kind of guide me


00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.760
alongside this series as well.


00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.120
So today is all about setting up the series.


00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.120
So if you're wondering, "Where's all the content?"


00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.720
come next week, there's gonna be more of it.


00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.880
But today's more setting up,


00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.120
and so it's gonna be a little bit more unique.


00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.500
But again, I'll ask the question,


00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.560
maybe answer this question,


00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.200
why are we going to talk about this series?


00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.260
I'm felt led of the Lord to talk about this series


00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.920
because personally, I have dealt with mental struggles


00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.920
over the last three to five, 10, 15 years


00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.960
as I begin to look back.


00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.600
And that may be surprising to you as a pastor,


00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.600
somebody that leads you each and every week


00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.640
could struggle with depression,


00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.640
could struggle with anxiety,


00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.780
can struggle with, burnout, worry,


00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.120
where it so consumes you and you wonder,


00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.900
can I even honestly share this with people around me?


00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.840
Is that okay?


00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.920
That's what I used to ask myself.


00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.020
Is that okay for me as a pastor to have those things?


00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.980
And that was a burden to carry for so long


00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.860
until I realized, you know what?


00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.760
I don't care if it's okay.


00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.760
It's not okay for me.


00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.640
And so if this is the first time you've heard me


00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.160
communicate that to you, hey, that's true.


00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.000
I deal with those things.


00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.400
There's some of you that I've shared with this before.


00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.340
But so that was one of the reasons


00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.180
why I wanted to tackle this,


00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.660
because I'm still trying to process how to do this


00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.460
as a pastor, as a follower of Jesus.


00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.240
But number two, I've actually talked to a couple people


00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.220
within our church and several within our community


00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.460
that struggle with these things.


00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.100
So this is something that's happening in our whole world,


00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.140
and so why do we just ignore it in the church?


00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.740
Let's address it, right?


00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.500
Let's not ignore it in the church, let's address it.


00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.500
And so then, again, I came upon some content


00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.160
in this past fall that really could help guide me in this,


00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.420
and I felt, okay, this is something


00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.180
I could probably tackle as a pastor.


00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.960
So again, knowing that, that's one of the reasons why.


00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.760
So I wanna kinda start a little bit with my story


00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.840
and then we'll kinda jump in.


00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.360
But my story is I begin to think back


00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.240
and the things that I've dealt with mentally as a kid.


00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.960
One of the things I realized early on in my life,


00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.800
most of you may have this as well, is trauma as a child.


00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.320
That we may not realize that trauma actually


00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.240
ends up happening where we have a reaction mentally,


00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.520
socially, to things that have happened in our lives.


00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.760
And I can't go into the details of it,


00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.120
but it may be a part of this series.


00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.600
But when I was about 12 or 13,


00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.400
we had some major issues within the home church


00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.120
that we had and a lot of trauma within our family.


00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.840
And I know my mom and dad are watching this


00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.800
and they know all about it,


00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.040
but that trauma led me to hate God,


00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.960
hate anybody that dealt with the church.


00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.040
I had a lot of anger issues,


00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.360
a lot of unforgiveness issues that were with me


00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.840
for eight to 10 years that controlled my life


00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.360
and was in and through my life.


00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.200
And the only time that I actually ended up being


00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.000
to able to overcome those was because of what Christ did


00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.880
in my life to help me learn how to forgive,


00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.160
help me learn how to deal with my anger.


00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.760
And that was when I started realizing this,


00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.040
is that that really affected me for 10 years,


00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.080
10 years it controlled me that much.


00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.880
Well it didn't stop then, as I got into college


00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.560
I ended up dealing with worry and anxiety and stress.


00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.280
And I remember early on in my ministry


00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.880
whenever I started serving on staff at a church,


00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.120
I dealt with a lot of, one, burnout,


00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.560
and then also with a little bit of anxiety.


00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.080
And I remember one Sunday driving into church,


00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.840
I'm going to serve the church,


00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.820
I've gotta be the person that's greeting at the door,


00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.800
the smile on the face, I've gotta be the person


00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.560
in the group, or small group, to lead and be the person


00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.640
that says everything's gonna be okay,


00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.160
and I'm literally screaming out in my car,


00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.760
asking God, why do I feel this way?


00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.840
Why am I so frustrated?


00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.280
Why do I feel so anxious?


00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.520
And you know what I heard in that car?


00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.120
Nothing.


00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.940
I heard nothing.


00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.080
And I was broken going to church, trying to serve.


00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.480
And I remember going into my small group,


00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.600
and luckily that week I wasn't leading my small group,


00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.680
and they asked this question, how can we pray for you?


00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.080
And then in that moment, I had to make the decision.


00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.600
Am I gonna be real or am I gonna say, I'm good?


00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.640
Y'all know that, right?


00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.440
When people say, hey, can I pray for you?


00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.260
And you know inside you have something


00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.720
that you wanna share, but you're like,


00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.820
can I share this in this group?


00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.460
And they not judge me.


00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.600
That was where I was.


00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.200
And it was that moment that I just let go.


00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.760
And I said, I'm struggling.


00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.680
And you know what that group did?


00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.840
They didn't say, man, how dare you?


00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.320
You Christian, you pastor, how dare you?


00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.160
You know what they said?


00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.960
Oh man, you know, I've been struggling with this lately.


00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.280
and I was trying to figure out how to figure this out.


00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.080
And so they surrounded me and they prayed for me.


00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.080
And that was the first part where I started seeing


00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.240
that it was okay, that God still loves us


00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.560
in the midst of our brokenness


00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.920
and still uses us in the midst of our brokenness.


00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.900
And so there's still more and more of our story,


00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.720
but even recently, and this is the last part of it


00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.160
before we jump in, even recently as a pastor


00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.480
leading this church, in 2021, I hit a wall.


00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.960
Just straight up hit a wall.


00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.880
You may have not known it.


00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.360
I may have covered it up well if you're around here.


00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.660
maybe you did know it and you just didn't say anything to me.


00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.820
But I hit a wall, and it was the moment where I decided,


00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.820
if I don't address this, I'll never make it.


00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.620
Like, this church is gonna fall apart,


00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.940
my marriage is gonna fall apart,


00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.260
everything's gonna fall apart.


00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.460
So I went and saw a counselor.


00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.580
I talked with the counselor.


00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.840
I invited mentors into my life to hold me accountable,


00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.060
to begin to talk to me and to walk with me


00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.880
through these things.


00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.720
And has it been easy?


00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.540
No, but what I've found, and this is where we're heading,


00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.340
what I have found is when I sought Jesus,


00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.040
knowing that Jesus didn't love me any less


00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.660
because of how I was, when I sought Jesus,


00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.380
I found shalom, shalom, perfect peace.


00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.380
And when I find myself going back towards anxiety


00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.780
and I going back towards worry and burnout,


00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.600
you know what happens?


00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.220
It's when I'm not seeking Jesus.


00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.180
Jesus is perfect peace is always present, always welcome.


00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.900
He's there, He never leaves us nor forsakes us,


00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.860
but it's whenever I chose to not seek Jesus.


00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.500
So I also wanna clarify this, that also,


00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.420
sometimes we do need to seek help,


00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.420
just like I sought a counselor.


00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.060
Sometimes, as I've learned lately,


00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.260
sometimes I just need to sleep.


00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.820
Sometimes I just need to eat the right foods.


00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.740
Those are all spiritual things, by the way.


00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.980
But sometimes we don't think about that,


00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.740
we think, well, no, I don't need to change this,


00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.580
I don't need to change this,


00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.340
but those things is what also helped me cope,


00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.540
because I was just learning that I wasn't sleeping enough.


00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.540
And when you don't sleep enough,


00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.900
everything seems to be bigger.


00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.900
Just let me give you a great example.


00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.140
Last night at 9 p.m., Brittany started talking to me


00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.460
about family stuff that has big decisions,


00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.780
and I'm not responding really well.


00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.860
And you know what she said?


00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.700
Go to sleep.


00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.700
You wanna know what she knew?


00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.980
In that moment, I wasn't thinking right.


00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.380
And I wanted to push through and fight about it,


00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.480
and she said, "No, we're not gonna fight."


00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.140
But by the morning, I was great.


00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.260
I was like, "Hey, let's talk about these things."


00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.500
She's like, "Yeah, I see sleep's what you needed."


00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.700
So again, as we jump into this, I'm not the only one.


00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.540
And one of the things we're gonna learn


00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.380
as we dive into the word of God,


00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.300
you're gonna see many characters in the Bible


00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.540
that dealt with very similar things, right?


00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.700
And so my guess is in a room this size


00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.620
that some of you have dealt with the same thing.


00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.500
Outwardly, maybe you're holding it together,


00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.180
but inwardly, you're falling apart,


00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.480
and you're wondering, how can I keep doing this?


00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.120
You're wondering, who can I tell without them judging me?


00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.320
Is it okay?


00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.460
And just wanna let you know that I hear you,


00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.260
God hears you, and God cares for you.


00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.100
And if it's not you now, it may be you in the future.


00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.380
And if it's not you now, it may be your friend,


00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.700
your coworker that need you to be present


00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.400
and know that you can be a safe place to be honest with.


00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.780
I really don't wanna miss people in this


00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.860
'cause I could see some of y'all saying,


00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.180
I don't share with any of that.


00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.900
And what's this message series do for me?


00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.900
God is preparing you for a future season


00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.760
or God is preparing you to minister to someone


00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.100
who is going through that season.


00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:00.940
Do you hear me?


00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.080
I hope you don't miss that part.


00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.020
So as we talk about the foundation of this series,


00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.540
I wanna pray for us.


00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.200
And it's really the series starting off with today


00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.600
is the most dangerous myths of our mental health


00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.540
when we talk about the church.


00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.900
And so I'm gonna pray with my eyes open this time.


00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.180
You guys may think that's really weird,


00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.260
but I'm gonna pray a verse over you.


00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.720
So you don't have to close your eyes either.


00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.460
But this is the verse that I wanna pray over you,


00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.060
pray over us as a church.


00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:27.260
Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you


00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.220
or set you apart completely.


00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.140
All right, may the God of peace sanctify you completely.


00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:37.140
And may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept sound


00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.220
and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus.


00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.900
He who calls you as faithful, he will do it.


00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.100
God is faithful.


00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.500
So I pray that over you and I pray that God


00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.980
moves in our lives and hearts today.


00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:48.820
So what I want you to do,


00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.540
I want you to look to the person next to you,


00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.400
if you have a person around you, say, God is my peace.


00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.320
Okay, now I want you to turn to the other person


00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.580
that you just told is not your favorite,


00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.940
and I want you to do to tell them


00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.960
that God is my perfect peace.


00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.960
I want you guys to remember this,


00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.740
that God is your perfect peace.


00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.380
God is your perfect peace.


00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.280
And so I'm so glad that as I've learned over the years


00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.940
that this is a safe place to share about these things.


00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.580
Again, going back to my church in Oklahoma,


00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.160
I never felt like I was comfortable enough


00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.100
to tell my pastor I struggle with these things.


00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.100
And I had barely gotten confident enough


00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.580
to be able to share with my small group.


00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.320
And I know in the church, this could be a little bit unique


00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.580
for you to talk about these things,


00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.080
but I know that it is important for us to do this.


00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.580
But have you ever had a well-meaning Christian say,


00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.260
You shouldn't struggle with this because you're a Christian.


00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.580
And it may not be mental health.


00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.240
You fill in the blank.


00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.540
Christians shouldn't struggle with this.


00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.740
Anybody had a well-meaning Christian say that to you?


00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.020
I mean, you're a Christian.


00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.980
Basically, you shouldn't struggle with anything.


00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.960
I know I've had that before.


00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.300
I've been told a couple of times


00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.820
whenever I've said I'm worrying about something


00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.540
that I've had a well-meaning Christian tell me,


00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.260
"Worry, that's sinful.


00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.780
"You need to repent right now and give it all over to God."


00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.140
And I'm like, "Well, I know I need to give it to God,


00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.660
"but right now I'm worrying.


00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.020
"Can you be a little bit more encouraging?"


00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.100
Of course I didn't say that to them,


00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.740
I just said, "Hey, thanks for the encouragement,"


00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.460
and walked away defeated.


00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.020
I'm just being honest, I walked away completely defeated


00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.580
because these would be Christians in my life


00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.900
that I would respect.


00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.820
And nothing against them,


00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.020
because that's probably what they were taught


00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.860
and that's how they figured it out.


00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.660
But I know that we need to be hearing something different.


00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.660
And so it could be true when we look at our lives


00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.920
that we need to just pursue God,


00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.580
and that is absolutely true in this.


00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.860
Maybe we do need to repent of our sins


00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.860
if there's something that's drawn us away from the Lord.


00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.900
But also I want us to know that it could just be


00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.660
that we need more sleep, we need professional help,


00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.860
we need God to guide us to those things as well.


00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.920
And so I wanna make this statement,


00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.800
just because your sins are forgiven


00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.300
doesn't mean that you don't struggle with these things.


00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.500
Just because our sins are forgiven


00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.900
doesn't mean we don't struggle with these things.


00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.060
And I also want you to know this,


00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.660
just because you come to God


00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.620
doesn't mean God's gonna perfectly fix everything.


00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.160
And I'll just give you a great example.


00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.660
The moment that I got saved,


00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.500
I would love to have a six pack of abs,


00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.660
but the Lord didn't say, "Hey, you're saved.


00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.980
"Glory to God, let's get those six-pack abs right now."


00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.660
He also, my bank account didn't go up.


00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.260
My wife didn't submit, like I promised


00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.580
that God would do that if I gave my life to him.


00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.340
And really, she probably taught me to submit more.


00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.420
So all those things that I'd hoped to get out


00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.460
of a relationship sometimes,


00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.380
I learned that that doesn't happen


00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.280
at the moment of salvation.


00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.740
What I learned, well, later,


00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.740
my wife's not submitting either, so that's later.


00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.620
We're not talking about that.


00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.320
That's not always a promise, okay?


00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.880
That's another sermon series for another day,


00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.840
and Brittany's not in here,


00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.200
she would probably be slapping me right now.


00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.840
But basically what I would say is that we can't claim


00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.600
that as we give our lives to Christ that we'll be perfect.


00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.360
This is a battle, and this is a challenge in our lives,


00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.720
that as we are followers of Jesus,


00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.680
we continually wrestle with the flesh,


00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.240
we wrestle with these things in our lives,


00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.760
and as we wrestle with them,


00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.040
God is our perfect peace in the midst of 'em.


00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.800
So I'm gonna focus on the spiritual aspects today,


00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.960
but I wanna read this to you,


00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.800
and I wanna kinda define a few things for us


00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.400
of what mental health is.


00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.440
Mental health would include at least three things,


00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.760
our emotional, psychological, and social well-being.


00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.360
And it's very important because our mental health


00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.280
is actually not static, which means this,


00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.040
it doesn't just stay the same the rest of our lives.


00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.280
Meaning this, that we can be really healthy


00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.440
for a little while, and then something happens,


00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.000
our body changes, we go through trauma,


00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.160
and we're healthy one moment,


00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.500
and the next, we're in a bad place.


00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.960
So our mental health actually impacts everything we do,


00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.300
right, it acts how we feel and how we determine


00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.460
how we handle stress and how we treat people


00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.740
and how we handle difficult situations.


00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.220
And there's so many misunderstandings


00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.540
when it comes to mental health.


00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.740
And we wanna build on that foundation today


00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.740
through God's word.


00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.020
And so the first myth that we find


00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.640
is that Christians shouldn't struggle


00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.020
with mental health, right?


00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.500
And so I want you to know this,


00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.560
that God loves you even though you may fight depression.


00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.400
God loves you even though you may be in the word every day


00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.080
and you still struggle with these things.


00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.700
Even though you have anxiety, God still loves you,


00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.200
even in the midst of your struggle.


00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.000
And when we look into the Bible,


00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.580
and we're gonna start with Elijah in 1 Kings 19,


00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.720
we're gonna see a prophet of God.


00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.760
And I wanna kind of set this up,


00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.880
a prophet of God who was great.


00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.440
This prophet of God had just got done


00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.120
basically killing all of these prophets of Baal,


00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.520
or Baal, whatever you wanna call him,


00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.960
where they went up on a mountain


00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.040
and they laid out all this wood


00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.440
and they put this sacrifice on the altar


00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.360
and this is what Elijah said to these prophets.


00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.280
He says, "Hey, why don't you call on your God


00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.760
"and see if he'll rain down fire and consume this offering."


00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.560
And these guys, I mean there's like hundreds of them,


00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.200
they begin to dance around and scream


00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.240
and call on their God and they were even crazy.


00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.080
They cut themselves.


00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.360
That's not the type of religion I wanna be a part of.


00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.440
But they did that for hours and nothing to avail.


00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.780
And Elijah called down one prayer,


00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.680
God, basically, will you move?


00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.160
and God rained down fire and consumed the offering.


00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.520
Right after that was whenever Elijah and many others


00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.280
killed those prophets because they were false prophets.


00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.240
And then you see Elijah go on the run.


00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.540
And you go, God just used Elijah mightily,


00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.640
and then he goes on the run.


00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.960
So let's read here in 1 Kings chapter 19,


00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.360
starting in verse one, it says,


00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.360
Ahab, which was the king at that time,


00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.680
told his wife Jezebel everything that Elijah had done


00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.080
and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.


00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.760
So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah and said,


00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.100
"May the gods punish me and do so severely


00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.600
"if I don't make your life like the one of them


00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.520
"by this time tomorrow."


00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.000
So like the prophets that he just got in killing.


00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.520
And then Elijah became very afraid.


00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.280
That is crazy.


00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.680
God just worked for Elijah.


00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.600
He is the godly man.


00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.280
And he was very afraid.


00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.000
And immediately ran for his life.


00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.600
And when he came to Beersheba,


00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.280
and that belonged to Judah, he left his servant there,


00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.880
but then went on a day's journey into the wilderness.


00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.320
And he sat down under a broom tree


00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.520
and prayed that he might die.


00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.720
And he said, "I have had enough, Lord.


00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.200
"Take my life, for I am no better than my father's."


00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.680
Then he lay down and he slept under the broom tree.


00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.760
And suddenly an angel touched him


00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.600
and the angel told him, "Get up and eat."


00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.240
And then he looked and there at his head


00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.360
was a loaf of bread over hot stones and a jug of water.


00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.240
And he ate and he drank and he laid down again.


00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.280
And then the angel of the Lord


00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.580
returned for a second time and touched him.


00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.860
and he said, "Get up and eat,


00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.080
"so the journey will be too much for you."


00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.580
And so he got up and ate and drank,


00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.680
and in the strength from the food,


00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.160
and he walked 40 days and 40 nights to Horeb,


00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.000
and the mountain of God,


00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.520
and he entered the cave there and spent the night.


00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.560
And so as we look at this prophet of God,


00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.360
he struggled, right?


00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.040
He struggled, and one of the things that we see


00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.280
right after God mightily used him,


00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.240
was he wished he would die,


00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.560
he slept all the time, and he lost his motivation.


00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.200
As you begin to even dive into this,


00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.280
When you look at symptoms of depression and anxiety,


00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.040
sometimes they lead to overwhelming exhaustion.


00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.080
And what he had just got done doing, obviously,


00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.640
is traveling was that as well.


00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.880
But this is a guy who struggled with some


00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.560
of the similar things that we may struggle with


00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.220
when it comes to mental health.


00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.400
But you know one of the things I want us to see with this?


00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.240
What did God provide Elijah in his time of need?


00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.960
His presence was one of them.


00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.800
Don't wanna miss that one.


00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.560
But what is the couple of things that he provided?


00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.400
Sleep, water, and food.


00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.340
The basics and necessities of life to overcome some of this.


00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.560
Now there's more to the story


00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.640
and I don't wanna miss all of that


00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.160
and I don't have time to go through all of that,


00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.000
but I would just say this,


00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.960
God provided some of the most essential things


00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.040
to help some of his worry and concern,


00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.600
to build him up physically,


00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.760
but then one of the coolest parts that I see in all of it


00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.600
was his presence.


00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.600
God never left him, even though he was worrying.


00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.200
I mean, this is a guy who God just mightily used


00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.140
and he can worry and God still shows his presence.


00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.700
This is a reminder that God meets you where you're at,


00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.840
No matter what you've done, no matter where you're at,


00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.480
God is always present.


00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.260
And so we are not immune to these things


00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.600
as followers of Jesus.


00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.200
God promises his presence in the midst of these struggles.


00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.160
So I wanna give just two quick other examples.


00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.200
David, and I'm not gonna go into any verses for it,


00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.000
but David, as we know a little bit more about David,


00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.320
if you read in the Psalms,


00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.400
David's the one who killed Goliath, right?


00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.200
Ah, man, this guy's gotta be perfect with the Lord.


00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.640
He never struggles with anything.


00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.960
Well, the majority of his Psalms talk about his despair


00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.240
and how he wondered if the Lord even heard him


00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.820
and if the Lord was even present.


00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.560
There was constantly David who was questioning God


00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.400
and then God would show up.


00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.080
We also know the prophet Jeremiah


00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.080
was known as the weeping prophet.


00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.400
And so I would say some of you may be known as that as well


00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.700
but that's not a bad thing, right?


00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.640
God was still present in his loneliness and his insecurity.


00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.080
He even cursed the day that he was born


00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.400
but God still used him.


00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.180
So if we find ourselves like many of other people


00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.800
in the world, that we do struggle with these things,


00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.140
what do we do?


00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.740
We go to God.


00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:54.520
We go to God and we know that God cares for us


00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.560
no matter what we're going through.


00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.640
And my encouragement, this is such an encouragement to you,


00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.600
go to your church family,


00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.480
because we can bear those burdens alongside you.


00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.400
If there's something we don't miss from this,


00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.360
I want, no matter what you're struggling with,


00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.640
if it's not mental health, if it's something else,


00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.520
You need to know that this church family


00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.900
is a place to come to without judgment,


00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.420
but to bring hope and to bring encouragement,


00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.540
to bring prayer and support.


00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.620
And we need to remember that God has provided


00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.900
those people there for such a time as this.


00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.940
So myth number two that we're gonna talk about


00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.240
is that God doesn't care about our mental health, right?


00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.720
We see a little bit in this Elijah story


00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.740
that God does care, right?


00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.220
But you may say this, why would God care about me


00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.020
when there's so many other things going on in the world?


00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.940
You guys know if you read any of the news,


00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.220
maybe that's why you have anxiety.


00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.260
But if you read any of the news,


00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.340
you know there's a lot going on.


00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.580
Doesn't God care more about those things?


00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.700
Like, doesn't he have more,


00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.420
like he needs to focus on those things, right?


00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.140
But this is the cool part.


00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.860
God has given us a individual relationship with him


00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:02.180
to care for you individually, 24/7, seven days a week.


00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.540
So does God care?


00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.380
Absolutely, 100% God cares about everything.


00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.100
the small things and the big things.


00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.320
No matter what you're going through, God cares.


00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.240
And so here's just some highlights from Psalms


00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.560
that shows us that God cares.


00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.040
And a lot of these will even come from David.


00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.560
Yeah, so the Lord is my light and my salvation.


00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.520
Whom shall I fear?


00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.480
Again, I don't have the verse references up here,


00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.380
but I'm just giving you a couple of clips from it.


00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.160
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted.


00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.920
He saves those who are crushed in the spirit.


00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.380
God is our refuge and our strength.


00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.640
He is our ever-present help in time of need.


00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.600
The Lord is my shepherd.


00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.040
I shall not want, he makes me lie down in green pastures,


00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.400
he restores my soul.


00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.800
Even though I walk through the valley


00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.160
of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,


00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.340
for thou art with me, your rod and your staff,


00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.680
they comfort me.


00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.560
So, I think it's so important for you to know today


00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.640
that God cares for you.


00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.020
And he says to cast every care, not just the small ones,


00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.560
not just the ones you feel confident about,


00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.520
it's every single thing you are going through,


00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.280
God 100% cares for you.


00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.140
And I wanna share a Psalm that maybe


00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.060
will be encouraging to you,


00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.900
because I'll go back to that day in the car


00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.740
where I felt like God wasn't present,


00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.160
and I wondered where God was,


00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.080
and I got out of my car,


00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.260
and when I went into my small group,


00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.060
and God prompted me to share in that small group,


00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.360
and that small group prayed for me.


00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.200
You know what God said?


00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.080
"Here I am."


00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.980
Because the people of God had the Spirit of God inside them


00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.240
to surround me in that moment.


00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.600
So you may be that person that says,


00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.440
"Where's God at?"


00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.900
Well, there's also a couple of Psalms.


00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.580
There's two Psalms where there's not a happy ending,


00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.880
and I wanna share one of them with you,


00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.300
because I'm that glass half empty guy.


00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.940
I want you to see the negative of it


00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.960
because some of you may be a lot like me.


00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.380
So in Psalm 88, it should be up on the screen here.


00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.380
Here's what a guy named Heman,


00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.020
so you know it's not He-man, but it's Heman,


00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:47.920
okay, whatever you wanna call it,


00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.140
but it's not the character here.


00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.160
This guy was good at a couple things.


00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.000
You'll see this here.


00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.380
He had a lot of music ability.


00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.700
He had great wisdom.


00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.640
He was a committed parent.


00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.220
He had great service to the king.


00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.320
This would be a man of God,


00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.260
somebody you would say is a deacon in the church,


00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.860
somebody who was well-known by God.


00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.040
And here's what he says, "I am overwhelmed with troubles


00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.580
and my life draws near to death.


00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.340
I'm counted among those who go down to the pit


00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.960
and I'm like one without strength.


00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.480
I'm set apart with the dead,


00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.260
like the slain who lie in the grave,


00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.140
who remember no more, who are cut off from your care.


00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.780
But I cry to you for help, Lord.


00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.060
In the morning, my prayer comes before you.


00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.220
Why, Lord, do you reject me and hide your face from me?


00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.020
You have taken from me friend and neighbor


00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.500
and darkness is my closest friend."


00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.880
See, in this Psalm you would think as you continue to read,


00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.420
there's more of this Psalm as you read through this,


00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.980
like where's the good ending, right?


00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.180
Where's the good ending, where's the good ending?


00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.940
And it ends and you're like,


00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.820
he sought the Lord, which is great,


00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.460
but sometimes in the seeking,


00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.340
we can still feel like God is absent.


00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.540
Absent.


00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:56.520
And I know that I have felt that way many times,


00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.060
but what sticks out to me is that he kept going to God


00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.940
despite how he felt.


00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.900
And I want you to take this.


00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.000
God wants you to be real.


00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.840
Don't, I mean, it's so funny,


00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.700
'cause again, maybe I'm the only one that does this.


00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.500
There's sometimes I won't share something with the Lord


00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:18.020
'cause I think he can't handle it, or he doesn't care.


00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.940
And it's so funny because God knows the thoughts


00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.180
of our heart and our mind.


00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.600
God already knows, he's waiting on you to cast it on him.


00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.660
So God wants us to be real.


00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.740
And here's the cool part.


00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.340
Today, if you're here and you're this person in the Psalm


00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.300
and you're showing your presence here,


00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.900
saying you care, God, I'm crying out to you


00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.180
and I'm wanting you to answer,


00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.460
and you're wondering where God is,


00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.100
here's what I promise you,


00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.740
that God is here present with you today.


00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.520
God cares for you.


00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.260
God sees your struggle.


00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.420
And you're not the only one.


00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:52.820
Do not let the enemy think and control those thoughts


00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.280
to where you're the only one.


00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.060
And I want you to know this,


00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.460
whenever we think about getting help


00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.920
and asking and inviting people in,


00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.420
maybe it's a counselor, maybe it is a small group


00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.260
that you share these things with.


00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.860
This is such a key statement.


00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.520
Getting help is not a sign of weakness,


00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.720
it's a sign of wisdom and strength.


00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.460
Getting help is not a sign of weakness,


00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.100
it's a sign of strength and wisdom.


00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:20.240
Over and over again, we have to humble ourselves


00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.240
before God, before our friends, and be real.


00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.660
You wanna know the hardest parts for me


00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.140
to be real with my mental struggles?


00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.960
There was one person that I struggled to share with.


00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.020
Wanna know who it is?


00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.760
My wife.


00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.460
She knows me.


00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.780
She loves me for who I am,


00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.060
but we had to sit down and have a long conversation,


00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.720
and I had to communicate why I felt the way I felt,


00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.600
and I didn't know why, and I hated it,


00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.320
just as much as she hated the way I was


00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.560
when I felt that way.


00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.400
And you know what it did?


00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.880
It brought us together


00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.720
where the enemy was trying to divide us,


00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.200
'cause you know what the enemy told me?


00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.680
Don't tell her.


00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.520
You know, you just need to be strong.


00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.420
you seem to suck it up, figure it out.


00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.660
And it didn't work, and it only made things more difficult.


00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.480
And I had to just get honest with her and be real.


00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.420
And once I did, and I want you to see this,


00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.260
when we are honest, when we share with others,


00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.420
there is power in sharing our struggles in the open.


00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.340
Wanna know why?


00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.500
What does the enemy do?


00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.460
He wants you alone.


00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.140
He wants you to think you're the only one going through it.


00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.100
He wants you to continually think on it


00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.260
and think on it and think on it


00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.940
and separate yourself from people


00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.820
who can remind you of God's hope.


00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.100
And so why do we share these things with people?


00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.740
Why am I today sharing this?


00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:35.660
'Cause you may walk out saying,


00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.900
"This pastor's not strong enough.


00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.980
"If he's got mental struggles, I don't wanna follow him."


00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.420
If you don't, every pastor you do follow


00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.420
is just not honestly telling you what he's struggling with.


00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.860
But you may walk out of this room and think,


00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.400
"You know what, this is crazy."


00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.780
But I want you to know that getting things out in the open


00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.260
and being honest before people


00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.700
Being honest for God is one of the most freeing things


00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.520
because the burden's not on you anymore.


00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.440
It's on God and it's on the people of God


00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.880
that he has placed around you.


00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.120
And thank God that he has given us this group


00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.640
to surround one another, to encourage one another,


00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.520
to say, I hear you and I see you


00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.740
and I know you're struggling and you just be you.


00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.400
If you gotta step back, if you gotta sit down,


00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.000
if you need to do whatever you need to do,


00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.680
we're there to support you.


00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.720
I would say this, if you need a mill,


00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.580
if you need to get off your feet and you need to go away,


00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.560
we'll figure out some way to send you away to get help.


00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.920
If you need counseling and you can't financially afford it,


00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.020
you come tell us as a church, we'll help you.


00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.220
That's what we're here for.


00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:38.220
We're here as a family of God, seeking God's face,


00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.080
and there's power in being open and honest.


00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.520
I was reminded in Matthew 22, 37,


00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.640
where it says, "Love the Lord your God


00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.060
"with all your heart, mind, and soul."


00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.400
And when I think about that with your mind,


00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.400
And some of the hardest things is where we defeat ourselves


00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.920
in our mind, and I've quoted this to you guys before,


00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:58.900
what we think on most is what we tend to be consumed by.


00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.640
And so our lives are heading in the direction


00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.500
of our strongest thoughts.


00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.440
Our strongest thoughts need to be on God


00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.100
and on the people of God that He's provided around us.


00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.240
And so Isaiah 26, three, this is what I've been sharing,


00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.840
this key verse here, it says,


00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.560
"You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you."


00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.680
I wanna say that again.


00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.040
"You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you,


00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.080
and all whose thoughts are fixed on you.


00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.320
Shalom, shalom, perfect peace.


00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.080
When we are dealing with these things,


00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.160
and as we go through this series,


00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.480
and as we break them down into individual pieces,


00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.640
I want you to know that every answer is to give it to God.


00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.560
But I just wanna promise you this,


00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.480
when you give it to God, God may say,


00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.080
the body of Christ needs to support you in this,


00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.840
which means maybe you do need a counselor.


00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.960
Maybe you do, and again, a Christian counselor,


00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.320
I know some, I can send you to a Christian counselor


00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.880
that's guiding you through the word of God


00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.240
and through our mental struggles


00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.840
and understanding how that works.


00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.720
You could just need to go to the doctor


00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.880
and learn that maybe you have thyroid issues.


00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.460
Maybe you have, I mean, I'm serious,


00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.200
I went and had a battery of tests this last fall


00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.220
because I was just struggling again.


00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.400
I said, "There's gotta be something wrong with me."


00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.400
You know what the doctor said?


00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.320
"You need vitamin D."


00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.280
That was like really the it,


00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.920
and I'm like, "There's gotta be something wrong.


00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.680
"I've got high blood pressure or something."


00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.520
She's like, "No."


00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.340
I was like, "Well, I'm just struggling


00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.180
"'cause there's just some days


00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.020
"need to sleep?"


00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.180
And she's like, "Well, sleep."


00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.080
And I'm like, "Oh, that's really cool.


00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.660
(audience laughing)


00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.340
"Is that easy?"


00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.040
And so, I say this, all this,


00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.460
is that it is give it to God.


00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.900
And sometimes God points you back to the people


00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.260
that he's provided in this world to help us in this journey.


00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.640
Don't let the enemy fool you


00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.380
that you can't be honest and open.


00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.140
And so, I'll just be honest with you.


00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.500
Was all these things that I've walked through


00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.820
and some of the things that I've learned


00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.380
have been an instant fix?


00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:49.460
No, like, if you've known me, I still struggle.


00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.820
And you know, but you know what the cool part is?


00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.740
Is I actually now have some things in place


00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.700
that when I'm struggling, I go back to God's presence.


00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.180
I go back to, I'm calling the people


00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.440
that I put in my life to say, hey, can you encourage me?


00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.800
Can you speak into my life?


00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.940
I still have access to the counselor in which I need.


00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.580
That's okay, because that's maybe what I need


00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.660
in order to keep going and do what I need to do,


00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.420
but I'm not gonna let it defeat me.


00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.660
I'm not gonna let the enemy defeat me and say


00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.940
that I've gotta figure it out on my own.


00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.060
So this is how I wanna end here.


00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.180
We have to just kind of remember,


00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.020
we have to reject these myths today


00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.300
that Christians shouldn't struggle with mental health


00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.740
and we need to reject the idea that God doesn't care


00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.740
because God absolutely, 100% does care.


00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.380
We're gonna spend some time over the next couple weeks


00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.380
and that's why this is just a set up series.


00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.420
We're gonna spend some time over the next couple weeks


00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:36.640
and I'm telling you next week,


00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.100
I've already been studying next week,


00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.820
I'm super excited about this.


00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.620
The three things that I taught you in our prayer time,


00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.060
we're literally gonna dive into.


00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:47.900
where the word of God talks about how a king prayed,


00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:52.220
his people prayed, and they paused, and they worshipped,


00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.660
and God won the battle for them.


00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.380
That's all they did, that's all they did.


00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.020
They had an enemy that was attacking them,


00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.620
and they didn't know what to do.


00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.900
I may have already just told you next week's message,


00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.800
but I'm just telling you, come back next week,


00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.720
because God reminds us that he is the one


00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.560
that defeats our enemies,


00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.380
and for me, it could be mental health.


00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.300
For you, it could be fear,


00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.380
and it could be an anxiety,


00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.820
and it could be other things


00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.040
that are going on in your life,


00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.700
but God defeats them through prayer,


00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.600
and pausing, and praise.


00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.420
God is so good, and I wanna lead you to his feet.


00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.980
Not a perfect plan that we can figure out outside of God,


00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.860
but God is the center of the plan.


00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.260
God gives us perfect peace.


00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.460
So as we move into invitation,


00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.600
I just really wanna encourage you guys to be honest.


00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.500
To be honest with yourselves,


00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.100
because you know what,


00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.540
I'm gonna try to share in this way as we end.


00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:49.480
One of the things that I struggle with


00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.980
even going through this series


00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.900
was what if I preach this series


00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:57.300
and everybody sitting listening is going,


00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.380
well, we don't struggle with that.


00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.580
What do we do with this?


00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:03.400
And I don't know if you do.


00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.560
I have no clue if you have any of these struggles.


00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.280
And so I pray today, not that you do,


00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.840
I pray that you don't.


00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.540
Don't hear what I'm saying.


00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.420
I pray that if you do, if it's three of you,


00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.660
the rest of y'all just suck it up


00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.200
over the next six weeks, okay?


00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.660
We're ministering to three people.


00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.540
I think there's somebody else that needs to hear this.


00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.000
Not only me, but there's somebody else in this room


00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.020
that needs to hear this.


00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.680
There's somebody that isn't here today


00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.840
that's gonna come next week that needs to hear this.


00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.260
And in all reality, you may know a friend, a neighbor,


00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:41.540
a parent, a sibling that needs to come to this series,


00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:44.620
and they need to hear that God is the one


00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.560
that can help them get through these things.


00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.080
I want you to begin to ask God that


00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.240
during this time of invitation.


00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.120
Who is it else that needs to hear this?


00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.820
It may be you, but it also may be somebody else


00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.080
in your life.


00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.720
But I'm praying that I am ministering


00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.080
to somebody outside myself.


00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.840
And so today during invitation,


00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.800
I want you to be honest before God.


00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.960
I want you to be honest before God,


00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.680
and I want you to admit if you are struggling with anything.


00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.320
And then I want you to just lay at his feet and say,


00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.400
"Lord, I still don't know how to quite pick this up


00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.800
"and figure this out, but it's yours, not mine,


00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.160
"it's yours, Lord."


00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.160
So dear invitation, I really am challenging you to do that.


00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.720
So I'm gonna pray for us,


00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.900
and we're gonna continue to talk a little bit more,


00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.700
and then we're gonna worship.


00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.260
So Lord Jesus, as I pray for those who are in this room,


00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.980
Lord, that are struggling, Lord, with,


00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.060
maybe it's anxiety or depression or burnout,


00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.300
or maybe it's worry,


00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.720
maybe it's trauma from some past experience, Lord,


00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.940
I don't know what it is, Lord,


00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.300
that they may be struggling with.


00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.720
But Lord, I pray for the person in this room today


00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.420
that they leave here heard.


00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.340
They leave here, Lord, reminded of the body of Christ


00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.580
that, Lord, you provided them to be around


00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.660
to get support and encouragement.


00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.460
Lord, I pray that if there's a person in this room, Lord,


00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.220
is not close to you,


00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.000
maybe they've been walking away from you,


00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.620
maybe they don't have a relationship with you, Lord,


00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:11.940
I pray that maybe today they experience true,


00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.540
lasting hope through a relationship with you


00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.620
and they begin to experience the perfect peace


00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:20.340
as they pursue you and not themselves and not the world.


00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:26.180
As we continue to pray, I really, I'm telling you,


00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.200
This is something I wanna get more direct with


00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.400
because I think when we come in on a Sunday morning,


00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.680
it's so easy to just watch the worship team


00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.800
and kind of sing along, to connect with some friends,


00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.360
listen to a message and go,


00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.460
"Okay, that sounds great," and then leave.


00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:46.260
But we are a church that's leading people to Jesus,


00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.200
that wants people to experience Jesus.


00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.400
And I know a room like this,


00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.700
there may be somebody that doesn't know Jesus.


00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.440
And I am at this point as a pastor


00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.100
that I don't wanna play it safe.


00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.480
I don't wanna play it safe.


00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.160
So here's what I want to challenge you with.


00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.840
If you want to experience a God


00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.000
that you've never experienced before,


00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.280
a relationship with Jesus


00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.080
that you've never experienced before,


00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.880
today is the day.


00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.880
Stop letting the enemy defeat you that it's not today.


00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.580
It is today.


00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.480
And so if you wanna experience hope and peace


00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.320
and a God who cares for you where you are,


00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.840
I want you to raise your hand right now.


00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.340
I want you to lift up your hand


00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.960
and admit that you have a need for Jesus,


00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.340
that we can pray for you and we can lead you to Jesus


00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.400
and that we can encourage you


00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.200
and walk alongside you in your faith.


00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.580
But the more and more that we sit here every week


00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:35.940
and we reject that, the more and more


00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.140
you're gonna miss out on the perfect peace.


00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:40.800
And so if you're in this room and you need Jesus,


00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.180
just lift up your hand.


00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.300
There's no one that is looking around laughing.


00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.500
There's actually gonna be people


00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.800
that are actually celebrating with you.


00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.260
And so if you need Jesus, I challenge you to do that now.


00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.180
And if you do, we'll pray with you and we'll encourage you.


00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.380
We're not here to embarrass you,


00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.280
but we're here to support you in this.


00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.900
And so I just wanna encourage you,


00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.840
those who haven't raised your hand,


00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.640
that during this time of invitation,


00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.820
that you ask the Lord to move in your life,


00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.440
to meet your needs, if it is that you need perfect peace,


00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:14.820
to meet your needs, if you need help in any of these areas,


00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.740
and then come back next week with a friend who does as well.


00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.220
So let's pray, Lord Jesus.


00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.140
Thank you again for your word, 'cause your word is truth.


00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.420
Thank you again, Lord, for the opportunity


00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:29.040
to remind myself and this church, Lord, that you do care.


00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.360
You see us where we are,


00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.000
no matter what we're struggling with,


00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.600
no matter what we're going through, Lord, you see us


00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:39.200
and you are here to guide us and to show your support


00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.120
and to show your love and to provide mercy and peace


00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.480
and to give us, Lord, what we need


00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.400
in order to experience you more and more


00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.280
and more and more and more.


00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.840
But God, I am so burdened over this thought


00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:57.840
that we don't seek you enough when we are worshiping


00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.720
and when we live out our lives, Lord,


00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.780
and I'm just praying, Lord,


00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.880
that every person in this room has conviction today.


00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.440
Lord, that they need to seek you first in all they do.


00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.840
And Lord, let that guide and direct their lives.


00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.640
So Lord, give this room a heart of worship today.


00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.840
Lord, give them a heart to call out to you


00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.680
and ask for help in these areas.


00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.020
And Lord, I pray that if there's any way that I can help,


00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.000
if somebody has questions about how to follow Jesus,


00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.520
they'll find me in the back,


00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.800
they'll come and ask questions, and I can pray with them.


00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.020
And so we pray this in your heavenly name, amen.


00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.420
I wanna mention this real quick for you,


00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.620
if you do need prayer, just individually,


00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.500
I'm gonna be in the back,


00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.120
I would love to be able to pray with you,


00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.080
even if it's just something


00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.340
that you have going on in your life.


00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.980
And so, Matt, you can lead us.


00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:50.980
