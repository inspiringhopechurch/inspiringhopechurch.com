00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.840
Hey there. Justin here and I wanted to show you
one of the easiest ways for you to give to your church.

00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:10.553
All you gotta do, send a text message.
Here I'll show you how I set it up.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:17.393
All I need to do is text an amount to 84321
and a link will be sent back to me.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:24.066
 I'll tap on that link, select my church, 
add an email address for the receipt, 

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.861
enter in my payment information, 
and that's it!

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:32.866
From now on when I want to give I just 
grab my phone and text an amount. 

00:00:33.117 --> 00:00:34.960
All right let's donate ten dollars now.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.913
And that's it. 

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:41.041
Ooh! Oh! I added an extra zero.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:45.420
Yeah, I'm gonna need to fix that. Um. 
Luckily I can.

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:51.840
Since it's been less than 30 minutes, I just send the word
REFUND and that last donation will be refunded.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.840
I'm gonna try it again.
And there we go.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.064
And that my friends is how you can
give with a text message. Happy giving.
