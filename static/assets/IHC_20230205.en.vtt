00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.090
Paul is in Rome.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.340
He's in prison, and he knows
that his life is almost over.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.310
That's the context now in which we read.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.570
He looks back on God's goodness
to him, and he looks forward

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.400
to the dangers and the hope.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.290
The Lord stood by me, gave me strength
to proclaim the message fully.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.280
Well, it is, um, awesome to
get the opportunity to, to

00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:40.470
come up and preach God's word.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.610
Um, you know, it's something that I, I,
I think it's easy to take for granted as

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:47.940
a, as a pastor of a church, this is what
you're expected to do every single week

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.090
is just come up and preach another message
and come up and preach another message.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.750
And Mondays are always us unusual
because Mondays it's kind of like

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.840
taking a deep breath and going,
man, that was a great weekend.

00:00:58.574 --> 00:01:00.375
What am I gonna speak about this week?

00:01:00.824 --> 00:01:03.795
Good news is that as a church,
we really value going through

00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:06.495
books of the Bible, and that's
what we're in the midst of today.

00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:09.285
Uh, we've been walking through the
book of second Timothy, and I say we've

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:11.745
been walking through it because we
kind of took a break during Christmas.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.965
Then we kind of came back in January
and did a few different things, but

00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:19.305
we're back in second Timothy chapter
three, uh, starting in verse 10.

00:01:20.024 --> 00:01:23.475
And, uh, we've really just enjoyed, um,
over the last year, probably year and a

00:01:23.475 --> 00:01:26.565
half, we've actually walked through the
book of First Timothy and we're working

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:27.824
through the book of second Timothy.

00:01:28.095 --> 00:01:30.945
And by the end of this month, God willing,
we will be done with the book of second

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:33.195
Timothy and then we'll go somewhere
else and we'll do something different.

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:35.565
But, um, this book has really been great.

00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:39.914
As we've been walking through it,
we've really been listening, um, from

00:01:39.914 --> 00:01:41.865
a wise person called Paul the Apostle.

00:01:41.865 --> 00:01:45.554
Paul has been speaking to, we,
we kind of quoted this way, his

00:01:45.554 --> 00:01:46.995
true son in the faith, Timothy.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.200
And when you look at Paul and Timothy's
relationship, Paul and Timothy's

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.600
relationship was really close.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.300
Like I would even say this, that the
Paul was Timothy's spiritual father, and

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.610
Timothy was, um, Paul's spiritual son.

00:02:02.325 --> 00:02:06.645
They were truly connected and Paul
truly cared about Timothy and he

00:02:06.645 --> 00:02:09.375
had brought Timothy along with him
in all of his missionary journeys

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:10.395
and all the things that he did.

00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:12.795
And Paul knew that he was
coming to the end of his life.

00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:14.085
And this is where he
is pinning this letter.

00:02:14.085 --> 00:02:16.905
He's coming to the end of his life
and he's got a few more things that

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.615
he wants to impart wisdom to Timothy,
um, and even to Timothy's church, you

00:02:21.615 --> 00:02:24.765
know, esis and, and when I begin to
think about this letter, you know, a

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:26.894
lot of times we can read these letters
and we can go, oh, that's great for

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.275
Timothy, but what does this mean for us?

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:28.515
And I.

00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:30.615
The God's word is timeless.

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:31.095
I dunno if you do.

00:02:31.095 --> 00:02:34.275
I believe God's word is timeless,
which means this is, as Paul

00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:36.045
speaking, he can speak to this.

00:02:36.975 --> 00:02:37.965
Inspiring Hope Church.

00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:38.265
Right.

00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:40.695
And I believe that he's
continued to do that today.

00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:44.525
But some of the themes that
we've seen is Paul is encouraging

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.095
Timothy to not be timid.

00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:46.335
Right.

00:02:46.335 --> 00:02:50.655
To, to stand up and to remember his faith
and to remember the foundation in which

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.845
he had built it on, which was on Christ.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.175
And to, to join him in the suffering
even though it was difficult and to,

00:02:56.505 --> 00:03:00.165
to, to pour into other people who,
so who can bear the burdens with him.

00:03:00.165 --> 00:03:03.525
And, and even lately we've been learning
this, that Timothy has been learning.

00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:08.835
And we're being reminded of all
of the, the false teachers, and we

00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:13.575
didn't say this, the imitators that
are trying to be godly people, but

00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:15.645
these godly people are actually.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.460
Ungodly people that are representing God
in, in, in a way that doesn't honor him.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.460
In this past week, when we talked
about in chapter three, and I just

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.190
kinda wanna catch you up on this, in
chapter three we talked about these

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.050
18 different characteristics, 18,
that, that Paul listed of all these

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.600
people that are living ungodly lives.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.950
But claim to be spiritual and they're
influencing the church in a negative way.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.410
They're drawing people
away from the faith.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.380
And so he basically says,
beware of these people.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.359
And so we learned about these
18 characteristics and we

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.590
dove deep into them last week.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.840
And it was interesting, uh, that many,
if not all of them, were factored

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.090
and focused in on selfishness.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.650
And I've really been challenged all of
us to consider this idea as, we don't

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.330
need to look at these 18 characteristics
as those people out there, but to really

00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:07.020
consider, could it be these people
in here that are actually living out

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.670
these characteristics that are ungodly?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.510
And it was really a challenge to
repentance and to evaluation and, and

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.270
to, to make sure that we're avoiding
these things in our lives so that they

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.500
don't distract us from the mission.

00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:20.235
But now Paul's going to transition
and finish up this chapter three

00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:24.675
to remind Timothy of a couple of
things, and he's gonna remind him

00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:27.495
of really what Paul did, right?

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:28.755
Timothy followed Paul.

00:04:28.755 --> 00:04:32.935
So he is saying, Hey, remember everything
that you saw me do, and he's gonna rem

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.305
remind him again of the false teachers.

00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:38.115
And then he's gonna re tell him to
remember the foundation of his faith.

00:04:38.535 --> 00:04:40.605
And, and in all of this, I
want you to see this today.

00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:44.775
All of this is, is in
this idea of Paul value.

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:49.715
the word of God so much that he
lived it out and he was challenging

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:53.534
Timothy to value the word of God
so that he could live it out.

00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:54.945
And that's our challenge today.

00:04:54.945 --> 00:04:57.675
And so I, I, I love being able to
engage everybody that's in the room.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.065
So I wanna ask this question, what
do you value most in your life?

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:04.635
When you, when you think about your
day-to-day life, what are some of the top

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.844
maybe five things that you value the most?

00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:08.655
You ready?

00:05:08.685 --> 00:05:09.705
You got something in your mind?

00:05:10.245 --> 00:05:10.695
All right, go.

00:05:10.695 --> 00:05:11.805
What, what do you value the most?

00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:12.945
Family?

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:13.995
And, okay, what else?

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.560
What God.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.510
See, see, you're the, you're
the Christian in the room.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.530
Good job.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.280
You did it.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.600
What'd you say?

00:05:21.605 --> 00:05:22.060
Sleep.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.650
Sleep.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.670
I knew that was gonna be on there.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.480
Let's get two more.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.000
What do you value the most in life?

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.240
Safety, health.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.450
See, these are, these are all things
that we would say we value so much

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.630
that they are a priority in our lives.

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.950
But here's what I begin to think about
that word value before we, we really dive.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.230
When I think about value means, it means
so much to me that I will prioritize it.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.520
That if I focus on, if I put
it as a top priority in my

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.910
life, it adds value to my life.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.350
Now, the challenge and the question
that I want you to begin to answer now,

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.530
and I pray that if, if you answer in
a different way, that by the end of

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.760
the day you'll value it differently.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.670
Do you value the word of God that way?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.120
Do you value the word of
God as one of your top?

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.719
That it is the word of God that speaks
to you, that guides and directs you, that

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:21.750
corrects you and teaches you and rebukes
you, and trains you for righteousness.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.620
And we're gonna read this today.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.450
I, I, I, I don't know if, if it, if you do
value the word of God, but I pray that by

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.920
the end of today, that you will value the
word of God as the most valuable thing.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.511
And that through that
God will transform you.

00:06:34.516 --> 00:06:38.700
That God will use you to grow
you to know him more and more.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.030
And.

00:06:40.034 --> 00:06:43.724
So let's read the word of God
today, second Timothy chapter

00:06:43.724 --> 00:06:45.284
three, starting in verse 10.

00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:48.825
Again, this is coming off after Paul
shared all the 18 characteristics

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:51.554
of these false teachers that
were leading people astray.

00:06:51.614 --> 00:06:57.344
Here's what he says, but you, Timothy,
you have followed my teaching, my

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:03.825
conduct, my purpose, my faith, my
patience, my love, my endurance, along

00:07:03.825 --> 00:07:05.294
with the persecutions and suffer.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.280
That came to me in Antioch.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.510
I iconium and lira what
pur persecutions I endured.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.230
Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:22.140
In fact, all who want to live a godly
life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.450
evil people and imposters will become
worse, deceiving and being deceived.

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:32.099
But as for you, you, Timothy, you
continue in what you've learned

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:33.599
firmly and firmly believed.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.280
You know those who taught?

00:07:35.925 --> 00:07:41.415
And you know that from infancy, infancy,
that you have known the sacred scriptures,

00:07:41.775 --> 00:07:45.915
which are able to give you wisdom for
salvation through faith and Christ Jesus.

00:07:46.275 --> 00:07:51.315
All scripture is inspired by God and is
profitable for teaching and for rebuking,

00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:55.695
and for correcting, and for training and
righteousness so that the man of God may

00:07:55.965 --> 00:07:59.805
be complete equipped for every good work.

00:07:59.865 --> 00:08:00.284
Let's pray.

00:08:00.284 --> 00:08:04.446
Lord Jesus, we pray that your words
speak to our hearts and transforms our.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:05.970
In Jesus name.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:06.510
Amen.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.180
So whenever I look at this, and just so
you know, I continue to preach from a

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.960
practical standpoint and the fact that
I, I am pretty dumb when it comes to

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.030
like studying things and doing things.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.860
And so I kind of go at this very basic.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.550
So I'm gonna walk through it again the
way that I think through scripture.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.870
And so the first thing that I see in this
scripture is Paul just reminding Timothy

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.900
that he has seen him live out his purpose.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.710
This is Paul saying, you've seen
me live out my purpose, Timothy.

00:08:34.439 --> 00:08:36.929
You've seen me do this
despite all these things.

00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:39.630
And so when we walk through these
first couple of verses, we're gonna

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:45.660
see what Timothy followed Paul
in what Timothy saw Paul live.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.459
Like, let me, let me ask this question.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.520
Is there there people in your
life that have influenced you

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.689
by the way that they've lived?

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.760
In a good way, hopefully.

00:08:53.819 --> 00:08:54.270
Right?

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.380
If you can think of those people, number
one, I encourage you to go tell them.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:58.859
Thank you.

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:01.709
I really, I really do.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:07.410
There's people that are influencing you
every day that are modeling for you how

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.300
to follow Jesus and live for Christ.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.920
They need to know that you see them.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.880
But see, that was the same thing for
Timothy, is he's looking at this.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.319
He's saying, man, you have made a
difference and, and I have made a

00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:20.430
difference in your life, Timothy.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:21.390
So look at these things.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:21.840
Right?

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.040
So Paul was that person for Timothy,
and, and when we think about.

00:09:27.555 --> 00:09:30.735
When he ended his life, Paul, he, he
wanted to finish with this statement,

00:09:30.735 --> 00:09:33.525
and we'll even talk about this next
week in sim, second Timothy four seven.

00:09:33.855 --> 00:09:35.775
Paul says this, I have
fought the good fight.

00:09:36.225 --> 00:09:38.355
I have finished the race,
I have kept the faith.

00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:42.405
And this is why Timothy need to be right
minded of these things because he need

00:09:42.405 --> 00:09:43.905
to be challenged with those same things.

00:09:44.204 --> 00:09:47.790
So as we look at this in, in verse
10, . He's saying, Timothy, don't get

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.319
distracted by all those false teachers.

00:09:49.319 --> 00:09:49.650
Right?

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.449
That we're living in a worldly way.

00:09:51.689 --> 00:09:53.189
But remember how you followed me?

00:09:53.189 --> 00:09:54.090
So how did he follow him?

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.699
He followed his teaching.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.120
What did Paul teach about?

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.270
The only way you'll know what Paul
taught about is if you're in the word

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.160
of God, and you see how Paul taught.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.420
Paul taught that Jesus
Christ came to save sinner.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.580
Paul taught that Jesus Christ
came to die in your place.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.840
He came to serve not to be.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.430
He came because we could
not save ourselves.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.340
Paul consistently and continually
suffered for the sake of Christ.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.550
You don't have to wonder what Paul taught.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.620
So when we think, what did Timothy learn?

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.460
Paul teaching.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.080
He taught about Jesus.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.460
And then he says this.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.140
He says, he followed my conduct.

00:10:34.145 --> 00:10:35.640
So Timothy followed Paul's conduct.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.800
Here is the critical piece.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.090
Paul, before Christ
taught a lot of things.

00:10:42.765 --> 00:10:48.795
Paul after Christ lived his life in
such a way that modeled what he taught.

00:10:48.795 --> 00:10:49.905
Does that make sense what I'm saying?

00:10:49.965 --> 00:10:52.305
His conduct backed up what he taught.

00:10:52.515 --> 00:10:54.345
Paul was really smart before Christ.

00:10:54.525 --> 00:10:57.225
He knew the scriptures, but
he didn't live the scriptures.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.165
He did not understand them so
much so that he lived them.

00:11:00.735 --> 00:11:06.705
See, that's so critical that the people in
which we follow don't just talk the talk.

00:11:07.005 --> 00:11:07.935
They walk the walk.

00:11:08.355 --> 00:11:09.645
You know what I'm talking about, right?

00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:13.770
You ever heard anybody ever seem like
they always had this really like,

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.860
big story about all these things that
they do and you're like, yeah, right.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.000
You know, and the reason why is
they wanna become that, but they,

00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:22.290
they don't know how to become that.

00:11:22.295 --> 00:11:23.970
And, and Paul wasn't that person.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.030
Paul spoke it and then he lived it.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.839
He backed it up.

00:11:27.845 --> 00:11:31.000
And so just some examples, he
didn't teach about sacrifice.

00:11:31.005 --> 00:11:33.540
Paul lived it, right?

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.589
He didn't live in luxury.

00:11:35.115 --> 00:11:37.125
Paul gave more than he ever received.

00:11:37.425 --> 00:11:42.465
He worked so that he would not be
a burden to someone else, and he

00:11:42.465 --> 00:11:44.235
was a servant, not a celebrity.

00:11:44.715 --> 00:11:48.285
You look at Paul, he consistently
lived out what he taught.

00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:50.115
Then he says this, and I love this.

00:11:50.235 --> 00:11:53.385
He said, Timothy, you
have followed my purpose.

00:11:53.385 --> 00:11:55.275
You have seen me live out my purpose.

00:11:55.545 --> 00:11:57.285
I, I, I want you to hear this.

00:11:57.285 --> 00:12:01.365
Our church is here to help you
discover your purpose through

00:12:01.365 --> 00:12:02.655
a relationship with Jesus.

00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:03.315
Just like.

00:12:04.215 --> 00:12:09.255
It's simple that we have all
been called to a purpose so

00:12:09.255 --> 00:12:10.305
much greater than ourselves.

00:12:10.305 --> 00:12:11.535
And I love this here.

00:12:11.535 --> 00:12:12.525
What was Paul's purpose?

00:12:12.525 --> 00:12:17.295
Acts 2024 says this, but I consider,
and this is, this is Paul basically

00:12:17.295 --> 00:12:22.725
saying this, I have considered my
life of no value to myself for my

00:12:22.725 --> 00:12:26.655
purpose is the finish my course and
the ministry I received from the Lord

00:12:26.655 --> 00:12:29.805
Jesus to testify to the gospel of God's.

00:12:31.455 --> 00:12:35.295
Paul went so far in Romans 1520 to
say this, it is my ambition to preach

00:12:35.295 --> 00:12:37.965
the gospel where Christ was not known.

00:12:38.895 --> 00:12:42.915
So when we look at Paul's purpose, Paul's
purpose was not for himself anymore.

00:12:43.545 --> 00:12:47.145
I, I don't want you to miss this
after he gave his life to Christ.

00:12:47.865 --> 00:12:51.885
Paul understood in his first part here,
but I consider my life of no value.

00:12:53.235 --> 00:12:57.675
Timothy Saul, Paul modeled that
and he didn't just model it.

00:12:57.675 --> 00:12:59.325
So Timothy would just say, Hey, great job.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:05.100
He modeled it for Timothy to follow
after, and then I'm, we're not even

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:09.300
just getting started here, but in that
idea as a follower of Jesus, do you

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:15.900
live in such a way that is sacrificial
for others, not just about yourself?

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.430
And it's kind of that idea are, are you
coming into church and making sure you

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:25.110
get your seat because it's all about
your seat and your place And I don't,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.600
no, we don't have that cuz we're in a new
spot, so you don't really have a seat.

00:13:27.605 --> 00:13:29.160
So you're probably figuring,
so this is a challenge.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.460
Do you move.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.050
So that you don't have a seat.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.410
Okay.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:35.700
Um, so Paul didn't waiver on his purpose
despite what was happening to him.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.030
Right?

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.270
Then he says this, he said,
you have followed my faith.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:46.380
See, Romans 10 17 says this faith comes
by hearing and by hearing the word of God.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.550
Let, let me just ask this quick
question here, if that scripture is

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.910
true, how valuable is the word of God
to you in order for you to have faith?

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:54.390
Anybody?

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.990
Faith comes by hearing.

00:13:58.319 --> 00:14:00.089
And hearing by the word of God.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.109
And so we understand the word of
God is wrote down in the Bible,

00:14:04.439 --> 00:14:06.810
but it is God speaking to you.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.719
That is wow.

00:14:10.229 --> 00:14:10.709
Wow.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.400
Faith comes by hearing,
hearing by the word of God.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.010
I remember quoting this several years
ago and I continued to quote it.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.580
Faith is seeing what God sees,
even though I can't see it.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.900
There's many times when we were reading
God's word and we say, God, I can't

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.880
physically see this, but God, you are
doing something amazing and, and what

00:14:29.885 --> 00:14:32.970
I've learned over and over again when I
understand that faith is seeing what God

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.400
sees, even though I can't see it today.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:40.650
I actually have gotten to see my faith
three years ago of this church planting.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:41.699
That's the cool part.

00:14:41.699 --> 00:14:43.920
In those days when I had
faith, even though I couldn't

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.970
see it, God could see it Now.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.110
My trust was in him.

00:14:46.319 --> 00:14:47.550
Today I get to experience it.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.030
That's true.

00:14:48.035 --> 00:14:48.510
Faith.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.949
Faith in God.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.410
Then he says this, right?

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.550
Follow my, you followed my
patience, and then I'll even

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:57.390
kind of jump down a little bit.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.189
He said, you also followed my endurance.

00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.370
Really?

00:14:59.370 --> 00:14:59.880
What does that mean?

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.380
He says, you followed my long suffering.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.060
I, I really want you to lean into this.

00:15:04.275 --> 00:15:09.525
. Paul endured suffering and persecution,
yet he was patient for God to work.

00:15:10.074 --> 00:15:11.685
I, I think I need to hear that today.

00:15:12.165 --> 00:15:13.964
Just can I, can I sit
with you a little bit?

00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:14.805
I'm gonna sit down.

00:15:18.105 --> 00:15:24.105
I need some patience so you guys
know I haven't perfected this.

00:15:24.855 --> 00:15:25.995
I'm listening with you.

00:15:26.865 --> 00:15:27.975
God is speaking to me.

00:15:28.545 --> 00:15:29.385
I'm gonna say this again.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.120
He said, Timothy, you followed
my patience and my endurance.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.990
This long suffering.

00:15:34.709 --> 00:15:37.410
Why would Paul do that?

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:38.430
Why?

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.030
Because Paul showed patience
to people so that he could

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.500
demonstrate the gospel to them.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.290
Patience.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.689
It's not about us, it's about others.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.610
He wasn't quick to write them off.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.949
And when you think about
Paul, he talks about this.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.790
Paul actually said what was
happening to him was the benefit of

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.300
the advancement of the gospel when
he was chained to a prison guard.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.350
He says, this is great.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.089
The prison guard can't go anywhere.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.670
I get to preach Jesus
to him and they change.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.810
These guys like have to rotate out
and I get to preach Jesus again.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.040
Why unchain me?

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:15.150
The gospel's actually
spreading perspective.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.160
Guys, our perspective is.

00:16:18.075 --> 00:16:22.065
But God's perspective is not, remember
that our perspective is limited,

00:16:22.455 --> 00:16:27.615
but God's perspective is not DePaul
loved people despite the hatred

00:16:27.615 --> 00:16:29.475
and persecution they had given him.

00:16:29.595 --> 00:16:34.185
He followed Jesus' example, and even
in Ephesians 4 32, he says this, be

00:16:34.365 --> 00:16:39.135
kind and compassionate to one another,
forgiving one another just as Christ, um,

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:41.625
or just as God has also forgave you in.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:45.075
So Paul modeled that to Timothy
and he modeled that to us.

00:16:45.225 --> 00:16:47.985
And the last one, he says, you
followed by persecutions and suffering.

00:16:48.255 --> 00:16:50.325
Here's just some examples
of what Paul went through.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:51.405
Paul went into prison.

00:16:51.495 --> 00:16:54.015
He was whipped, he was
beaten, he was stoned.

00:16:54.135 --> 00:16:58.575
And there was many, many, many, many
harsh things said to him, he suffered

00:16:58.575 --> 00:17:01.965
for our benefit so that we could
see his example of following Christ.

00:17:03.165 --> 00:17:04.395
And so what is persecution?

00:17:04.395 --> 00:17:07.125
It's when we suffer for the sake of
Christ, and it can be different things

00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:08.565
and it's hard for us to understand.

00:17:09.825 --> 00:17:12.015
Imprisonment for our faith
looks like in the United States.

00:17:12.015 --> 00:17:14.805
It's hard for us to understand
what persecution looks like

00:17:15.105 --> 00:17:16.964
in in the example to Paul.

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.905
But if we think about this, there's
going to be times in which you stand up

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:24.345
for your faith when your friends, your
family, and your community question why.

00:17:25.005 --> 00:17:26.835
Why do you live in such a way that you do?

00:17:27.194 --> 00:17:31.185
And Paul said he did it for the sake of
the gospel so that it could be spread.

00:17:32.865 --> 00:17:36.285
And what I love about all of this,
it almost sounds like Timothy, you

00:17:36.285 --> 00:17:38.595
remember I've had a pretty rough life.

00:17:39.555 --> 00:17:45.105
But then he says this and he says, and
yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:47.805
See, God is faithful.

00:17:47.895 --> 00:17:49.035
God is always present.

00:17:49.155 --> 00:17:51.495
He will always help us
in our times of need.

00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:56.055
So Timothy followed and
saw Paul do all of this.

00:17:56.595 --> 00:17:59.835
So why would Paul remind Timothy
about all that he saw him go

00:17:59.835 --> 00:18:01.305
through and how he lived his life?

00:18:01.815 --> 00:18:02.745
Why would we need to remember?

00:18:03.855 --> 00:18:06.345
Verse 12 tells us that answer.

00:18:06.645 --> 00:18:07.665
Here's what he says.

00:18:07.905 --> 00:18:12.375
He says, in fact, all who want
to live a God life in Christ

00:18:12.375 --> 00:18:13.784
Jesus will be persecuted.

00:18:15.044 --> 00:18:18.554
Just so you know, not many of us
wanted to show up to church today

00:18:18.554 --> 00:18:22.274
to hear that question, that that
statement, all who want to live a godly

00:18:22.274 --> 00:18:27.794
life in Christ will be persecuted,
not if maybe sometimes it you.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.030
What does this mean?

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.550
Am am I a godly person if
I've given my life to Jesus?

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:32.940
Yes.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.420
If you are a follower of Jesus,
you will suffer persecution.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.210
Paul knew this for Timothy
and he knew this for us.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.080
And here's what he's saying.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.340
You've saw my life.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.970
You saw how I've suffered persecution
and how the Lord has sustained me.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.320
And really what he would even say,
and this is the picture Paul's

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.470
saying to Timothy, you've saw
all the people that I've impact.

00:18:53.324 --> 00:18:55.905
Who have given their lives to
Jesus, who have been forgiven of

00:18:55.905 --> 00:18:57.405
their sins, have been transformed.

00:18:57.405 --> 00:19:01.155
You've seen all this happen
and the Lord sustained me.

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:03.165
Now you go and do likewise.

00:19:04.094 --> 00:19:05.355
He wanted to prepare him.

00:19:05.475 --> 00:19:10.935
I'll just tell you this, if I know what
I'm going into, I'm better equipped

00:19:11.084 --> 00:19:15.284
and more likely to succeed than if
I'm shocked than what I'm going into.

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:20.264
We are going into, just so you
know, we have been as a church,

00:19:20.445 --> 00:19:22.425
we've been going into a city.

00:19:23.475 --> 00:19:28.965
Into our communities, into our jobs,
into our lives, to fight the world will

00:19:28.965 --> 00:19:33.105
be times that we suffer persecution,
yes, but the Lord will sustain us.

00:19:34.035 --> 00:19:39.195
And so we should be challenged and
inspired by Timothy or Paul's life.

00:19:39.285 --> 00:19:44.475
And I believe Timothy, Saul, Paul value
the word of God and value following

00:19:44.655 --> 00:19:48.675
the living God and how he would rescue
him, and he could do that for us.

00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:51.585
So then he takes just verse 13, and
this is what the fun part of it.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.195
He's been consistently talking about
these false teachers, but he, he brings

00:19:54.195 --> 00:19:58.725
it up again in verse 13 and he says This
evil people and imposters will become

00:19:58.725 --> 00:20:00.795
worse deceiving and being deceived.

00:20:01.455 --> 00:20:04.815
So it's like, hey, just, just so
you know, those evil people that

00:20:04.815 --> 00:20:08.055
I just got done talking about,
they're gonna get worse in your day.

00:20:09.135 --> 00:20:10.875
That's like almost 2000 years ago.

00:20:10.875 --> 00:20:14.235
He's telling Timothy they're gonna
get worse for you than they were for.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.360
What do you think is
gonna be worse for us?

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.990
You think it's gonna be worse
than Timothy I I think it can be.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:23.730
I think it can be.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.780
Now this is maybe taking us
a little bit of a side note.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:32.670
I think it can be if we don't just
learn the word, but we live the word.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.200
Because if we don't live the word,
what are they gonna persecute us about?

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.040
We may have a lot of knowledge about
what it means to follow Jesus, but as

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.660
we live, the word persecution will.

00:20:43.705 --> 00:20:44.475
and so we know that.

00:20:44.804 --> 00:20:47.715
And so these evil people and
imposters will always be there, is

00:20:47.715 --> 00:20:48.735
basically what he's saying, right?

00:20:48.945 --> 00:20:51.794
He explained all the characteristics
in verses one through nine, and

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.725
I think this is so critical.

00:20:52.725 --> 00:20:53.774
Don't miss this piece.

00:20:54.524 --> 00:20:57.135
I wanna go back and read verse
five of, of chapter three here,

00:20:57.585 --> 00:21:01.245
and he says, holding to the form
of godliness but denying its power.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.175
Avoid these people.

00:21:02.235 --> 00:21:06.945
There are people that will claim
godliness, but will be teaching the truth.

00:21:07.544 --> 00:21:10.365
And these are people that we
have to avoid their imposters.

00:21:10.365 --> 00:21:12.764
They're trying to act
like they are spiritual.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.130
. And so I think that is difficult to
know that it won't get easier, right?

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.420
Even he's saying this,
it won't get easier.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:22.650
Easier, but he says they're gonna
deceive people because they're deceived.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.730
And I think the challenge to us is
the only way we'll know if we're gonna

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.590
be deceived is to know the truth.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:33.120
I've said this over and over
again before, but how do they know

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.830
when we talk about counterfeit.

00:21:35.985 --> 00:21:38.324
They don't study all the
different counterfeit money.

00:21:38.324 --> 00:21:41.534
They studied the real thing so
that when the counterfeit comes,

00:21:41.745 --> 00:21:43.064
bam, I know it's not real.

00:21:44.985 --> 00:21:48.584
Paul is prioritizing the word of
God because it is valuable to him.

00:21:48.885 --> 00:21:52.574
He's challenging Timothy to value the word
of God because it is valuable for him.

00:21:52.574 --> 00:21:55.215
And, and, and so I, I know many of
us in this room probably haven't

00:21:55.215 --> 00:21:57.885
rock climbed before, but as I begin
to just think about some different

00:21:57.885 --> 00:21:59.175
things, I think about rock climbing.

00:21:59.564 --> 00:22:02.385
Our anchoring points when we rock
climb are important because guess what?

00:22:02.385 --> 00:22:04.225
If one slip without an
anchoring point were.

00:22:05.205 --> 00:22:07.395
Unless you're like one foot off the
ground, maybe you're not, but you

00:22:07.395 --> 00:22:09.675
know, more or less it's a disaster.

00:22:09.675 --> 00:22:11.955
We'd be crazy for not putting
in these anchoring points.

00:22:12.075 --> 00:22:12.825
Here's what I would say.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:18.315
Living a life without having the
word of God as an anchor to secure us

00:22:18.375 --> 00:22:21.165
alongside the way would be pretty stupid.

00:22:22.095 --> 00:22:25.514
Whenever I say the statement, is
the word of God valuable to you, I

00:22:25.514 --> 00:22:30.555
hope you're beginning to say, yeah,
the word of God is valuable because

00:22:30.555 --> 00:22:33.014
it's gonna protect me and it's gonna
guide me, and it's gonna encourage.

00:22:33.584 --> 00:22:34.605
It's gonna give me wisdom.

00:22:34.995 --> 00:22:36.735
So then he goes back to this, right?

00:22:37.304 --> 00:22:39.855
He says, now, Timothy, continue
in what you have learned.

00:22:40.034 --> 00:22:42.044
Continue in what you have learned.

00:22:42.344 --> 00:22:45.344
So we see here in verse 14, he says,
but as for you, continue in what

00:22:45.344 --> 00:22:47.024
you've learned and firmly believed.

00:22:47.475 --> 00:22:50.445
You know those who taught you,
and you know that from infancy.

00:22:51.015 --> 00:22:54.105
You have known the sacred
script scriptures from salvation

00:22:54.105 --> 00:22:55.455
through faith in Jesus Christ.

00:22:55.725 --> 00:22:59.505
All scripture is inspired by God and
is profitable for teaching, rebuking,

00:22:59.565 --> 00:23:04.065
correcting, training righteousness so that
the man of God may be complete equipped

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:07.455
for every good work despite all the evil.

00:23:07.575 --> 00:23:08.085
Here's what he's saying.

00:23:08.085 --> 00:23:12.629
Despite all the evil Timothy
that is around you, You continue

00:23:12.899 --> 00:23:14.070
in what you firmly believed.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.720
Now, as I was listening to this, and
again, I love looking at scripture

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.169
and, and, and saying, okay, he's
speaking to Timothy as he's speaking

00:23:22.169 --> 00:23:27.720
to me, and I stopped when I read this
because if I read this, Hey, Ben,

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.129
continuing what you have learned,
what if what I've learned is wrong?

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:38.460
I can't take this scripture literal
to me for Paul to say, Hey, Ben,

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.270
continue what you've learned.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:39.600
If.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:44.550
Learning my knowledge, my wisdom
that I have received is not a

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.590
godly wisdom from the word of God.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.700
So I wanna caution us from Paul
saying directly to you, continue

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.720
on living how you're living.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:56.820
So what I want us to do is I
wanna say, how did Timothy grow up

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.990
living and what is Paul challenging
him to continue living in?

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.480
And now let's apply that
to continue living in.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.260
Does that make sense?

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.940
I wanna make sure, cuz I even challenged.

00:24:07.054 --> 00:24:09.195
. So now get ahead of myself and go, oh, I'm
just gonna continue the way I'm living.

00:24:09.195 --> 00:24:12.584
No, I'm gonna see how Timothy lived
and then I'm gonna continue in that.

00:24:13.064 --> 00:24:15.074
So it's important when we look at this.

00:24:15.284 --> 00:24:18.254
So how did Timothy continue to live?

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.824
So first thing I want us to see here
is he says, remember who taught you,

00:24:22.125 --> 00:24:24.915
remember who taught you Well, we
know that Paul taught him, right?

00:24:24.945 --> 00:24:25.485
Paul taught him.

00:24:25.514 --> 00:24:26.595
That was a simple one.

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:30.705
But if you go back to verses four
and five, in second Timothy, it says

00:24:30.705 --> 00:24:34.905
that his grandmother and his mother
taught him since he was a baby.

00:24:36.135 --> 00:24:38.625
They were godly people in his life.

00:24:38.895 --> 00:24:40.064
They taught him the scriptures.

00:24:40.304 --> 00:24:41.054
As it says.

00:24:41.354 --> 00:24:42.284
They poured into him.

00:24:42.284 --> 00:24:44.864
They prayed for him, they brought him.

00:24:44.985 --> 00:24:48.614
Whenever Paul was coming around and
speaking, whenever Paul invited him to go

00:24:48.614 --> 00:24:50.054
on a missionary journey, they sent him.

00:24:50.564 --> 00:24:57.225
This was something that Paul was saying,
continue in this continuing living the

00:24:57.225 --> 00:24:59.235
way in which you had been grown up.

00:24:59.235 --> 00:24:59.504
Right?

00:24:59.745 --> 00:25:01.155
So what truth did they teach him?

00:25:01.155 --> 00:25:01.364
Right?

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.885
The word of God, which gave
him, and I think this is so.

00:25:05.055 --> 00:25:08.115
The word of God gives us
wisdom and knowledge of the

00:25:08.115 --> 00:25:09.615
salvation through Jesus Christ.

00:25:10.254 --> 00:25:15.465
I, I, I think it's sometimes we get this,
just so you know, I, I, I love the deeper

00:25:15.465 --> 00:25:19.695
works of the scripture where we learn like
about ourselves and how God's designed

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.965
us and all these different things,
and just about creation and the fall.

00:25:22.965 --> 00:25:28.125
I love all those things, but if
we miss the most critical piece

00:25:28.395 --> 00:25:33.045
of the word of God, it is to
reveal salvation in Jesus Christ.

00:25:34.305 --> 00:25:37.785
If we don't give our lives to Christ,
if we don't experience that first, the

00:25:37.785 --> 00:25:41.145
rest of it is, is almost meaningless
because we'll just begin to try to

00:25:41.145 --> 00:25:42.495
change ourselves to become better people.

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:46.455
The really, it's to know Christ
and so he was pointing him, and I

00:25:46.455 --> 00:25:49.875
love this, even Timothy, he knows,
has given his life to Christ.

00:25:49.875 --> 00:25:54.075
He points him back to his
salvation, and, and I guys don't

00:25:54.075 --> 00:25:55.845
miss that foundation of Christ.

00:25:56.504 --> 00:26:01.965
When he says, remember that it brings
salvation, so without the truth of the.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:04.650
, no one would know how to be saved.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.630
That's why it's important, right?

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.800
The Bible was reading one day
is the Bible is like a mirror.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.750
It reminds us of our condition.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.060
And so it's like waking up
just like I did this morning.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.560
My hair was a mess.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.210
My hair was a mess.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:19.500
I did take a shower, right?

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:23.100
But, and I'm like, man, if I went out in
this condition, it looks pretty rough.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.680
So when we're in the word
of God, it reminds us of our

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.420
condition and our need for Christ.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:28.190
And so he.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:31.530
Timothy to say, Hey, look,
in the word of God, remind,

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.410
remember, of your need for Jesus.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.240
But then in verse 16, he now begins
to even expand this even more.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.670
He says, all scripture is inspired by God.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:43.890
See, that's why we call ourselves
inspiring Hope Church, because we're

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.210
inspired by the word of God, right?

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.530
I've said this over and over again.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.580
As we are inspired by the word
of God, we will inspire others.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.970
We will have nothing to inspire
others by without the word of God,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.380
without the inspiration of the holy.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.620
And that's why we say we
prioritize the word of God.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.420
So it is inspired by God.

00:27:00.425 --> 00:27:01.200
And so this means this.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.190
It is God breathed.

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:07.080
When we read the word, it
is God speaking to you.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.420
I heard somebody say this once.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.310
I wish God would just speak to me.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.800
You know what somebody
said he already did.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.990
Open up your Bible and begin to read and
you'll hear him speak loud and clear.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.150
I'm gonna say that again.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.310
If you're ever wondering, God, speak to.

00:27:24.465 --> 00:27:27.929
open up the word of God and he
will speak because he already did.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.970
That's the beautiful picture.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.159
I mean, I, that's cool.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:33.899
I mean, that's just me.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:34.860
I mean, that's just me.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.840
I, I, I think that's
really, really cool, right?

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.220
So Paul says this, and this is
where, um, I like things that are

00:27:41.225 --> 00:27:42.449
profitable and valuable for me.

00:27:42.449 --> 00:27:44.129
I ask that question,
what's valuable to you?

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.765
And so he says,  it inspired
by God, and it is profitable.

00:27:48.765 --> 00:27:51.555
For you, Timothy, this
is valuable for you.

00:27:51.555 --> 00:27:52.875
It adds value.

00:27:53.055 --> 00:27:54.285
I heard people say, sleep.

00:27:54.555 --> 00:27:55.335
I'll just tell you.

00:27:55.335 --> 00:27:57.615
If I don't eat and I don't
sleep, I'm pretty hangry.

00:27:57.945 --> 00:28:01.365
So I think that those two
things are valuable for me.

00:28:02.235 --> 00:28:02.895
So I do them.

00:28:03.675 --> 00:28:04.965
I eat, I sleep.

00:28:05.985 --> 00:28:07.875
When I think about the word of
God, I wanna think of it in this.

00:28:08.685 --> 00:28:10.064
It is so valuable for me.

00:28:10.274 --> 00:28:12.405
And so what is the word
of God valuable for?

00:28:12.435 --> 00:28:14.925
Let's just walk through this
pretty quickly for teaching.

00:28:14.929 --> 00:28:15.945
This makes sense, Doug.

00:28:15.945 --> 00:28:19.574
The word of God's gonna teach us
who God is, what God has done for

00:28:19.574 --> 00:28:21.074
us and what God has called us to do.

00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:21.705
I'm gonna say this again.

00:28:22.004 --> 00:28:27.405
God's word is there for teaching
about who God is, what God has

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:31.574
done for us, and who God has called
us to be, to fulfill our purpose.

00:28:31.965 --> 00:28:32.774
Here's the fun part.

00:28:32.774 --> 00:28:34.004
I know nobody wants to see this one.

00:28:34.304 --> 00:28:35.594
The word of God's there for rebuke.

00:28:38.805 --> 00:28:40.575
You ever rebuked someone in your life?

00:28:41.055 --> 00:28:45.855
Maybe your child, your dog,
family member, friend, you maybe.

00:28:45.855 --> 00:28:46.485
I don't know that stuff.

00:28:46.695 --> 00:28:49.635
Um, so rebuking, let me, let me give
this, I like to be able to kind of,

00:28:49.875 --> 00:28:52.275
those things scare people, but I wanna
kind of dive in a little bit here.

00:28:52.695 --> 00:28:54.075
You know what rebuking really is?

00:28:54.825 --> 00:28:58.575
It's for pointing out in your
life where you've fallen short.

00:28:59.595 --> 00:29:01.125
Let me just go a little bit, step further.

00:29:01.605 --> 00:29:05.055
It's pointing out where you've
missed God's best in your.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.620
That's valuable to me when I read
it that way, when I read it, that

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:14.490
rebuking is about really pointing
out where I'm missing God's best.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.780
I want God's best.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:16.950
You guys want God's best.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:24.360
See, that makes me wanna get in the word
cuz I don't mind being rebuked cuz I wanna

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.920
be told I'm missing out on God's best.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.070
Then he says this, it is for correcting.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:29.910
Here's the great part.

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:34.290
God doesn't disappoint out where
you're lacking and say figured.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:35.940
Sucks for you.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.750
No, he says Now here it is.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.710
It's for correcting.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:41.790
It's for correcting.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:45.390
And he says this to point you in the right
direction, to experience God's best for

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:47.760
your life, to get back on the right track.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.350
And then he goes into for
training and righteousness, right?

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.000
To put a plan together.

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:58.740
God's word is a plan to help us
follow in order to become who God

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:03.510
has truly designed us to be in a
perfect relationship with Jesus.

00:30:04.455 --> 00:30:07.485
To fulfill our purpose,
to discover hope in Jesus.

00:30:07.995 --> 00:30:10.995
And after you've discovered that
hope in Jesus to continue to

00:30:10.995 --> 00:30:12.285
discover it day in and day out.

00:30:12.345 --> 00:30:20.205
And then as you have to be an inspiration,
a light to the world who hasn't I, I

00:30:20.205 --> 00:30:26.235
don't know if that motivates you to
value the word of God like it makes

00:30:26.235 --> 00:30:31.255
me, and here's the thing, just so you
know, I've been reading through the old.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.220
And I've been on Leviticus
lately, and I get it.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.620
Some things just don't make sense.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.530
So if you're telling me,
but what about that text?

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:44.520
I go, just ask the Lord when you
get to heaven, why Leviticus?

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:50.910
But there's so much value in the word of
God to give encouragement and direction

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:57.450
to rebuke in a way that is good for us
to correct in a way that is valuable for.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:02.550
To train us for righteousness, for
right living to to not just live

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.250
right so that we can be justified
before God, because that's not it.

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:08.460
We're justified before God because of what
Jesus did, but to live right so that we

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.810
can experience God's best for our life
and so that we can make a difference.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.270
This side of heaven, I
tell people this all along.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:19.500
If you give your life to Jesus
just to experience heaven, you've

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.690
missed out on some of the greatest
things that God's given you.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.860
Heaven this side of.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.560
I dearly love people of God.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:37.530
I dearly love people who are far from God
because I was there once and the burdens

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:42.930
that I felt and the life that I was living
was not God's best, and it's not their

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:45.780
best, and I want them to experience God.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.400
How do I do that?

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:51.510
By training in righteousness,
by training in righteousness.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.180
I don't know about you, but
I wanna make a difference.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.670
In my life, I wanna fulfill my purpose.

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:58.950
Paul came to fulfill his purpose.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.590
He's challenging Timothy
to fulfill his purpose.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:02.910
And he said this value God's word.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.010
It's simple value, God's word.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.690
So if you look at 17, right?

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.770
17 sets it all up.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:08.910
So that why?

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:10.260
Why do we value God's word?

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:12.180
Why is it profitable?

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:15.030
So that the man, woman as well.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:15.990
So I'm not leaving you ladies out.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.710
So the people of God, okay, so you
understand this, the people of God may

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:22.980
be complete equipped for every good.

00:32:24.435 --> 00:32:27.825
I tell you this, I don't like going
anywhere that I'm not prepared for.

00:32:28.245 --> 00:32:28.784
Wanna know why?

00:32:28.814 --> 00:32:29.865
Cause I wanna be well-equipped.

00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:30.855
I wanna be well aware.

00:32:30.975 --> 00:32:36.254
I wanna bring my A game and my best
as a follower of Jesus if we're

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:37.875
looking at being the light of Christ.

00:32:38.594 --> 00:32:41.205
And experiencing what God has for us.

00:32:41.564 --> 00:32:45.104
It will be through the word of
God and we will bring our best.

00:32:45.104 --> 00:32:48.314
And he says this, to be complete
is really to be perfect and know

00:32:48.314 --> 00:32:51.044
we're not gonna be perfect this
side of heaven, but to be perfect.

00:32:51.044 --> 00:32:57.044
The idea is, is to be ready
for what God has for us.

00:32:57.584 --> 00:33:01.875
So Timothy, Saul, through Paul,
that the word of God was profitable.

00:33:03.495 --> 00:33:06.395
We see through Timothy and Paul
that the word of God was profit.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.700
. He just needed to remember.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.810
There is power in remembering
cuz it's easy to forget.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.070
It's easy to forget.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:18.540
It's easy to forget, especially
when we're facing persecutions,

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.280
just like Timothy was about to face.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.940
I know this as we kind of finish up
today, what we value in our life.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.530
Most matters, I'm gonna
say you this again.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.520
What you value in your life, most matters.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.700
It will change the tra trajectory of your.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:42.990
Today, you have the choice to walk outta
here, forget everything that was said,

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:50.610
and continue living the way you were, or,
or there's another option to take what

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:52.950
you heard today and say, you know what?

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:58.530
No more today, I wanna
experience God in a new way.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:01.890
You still may be a believer in Jesus,
and you haven't experienced value

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:04.860
in God's word as much as you should
because it, you just missed this.

00:34:05.805 --> 00:34:07.065
Today, you can be transformed.

00:34:07.185 --> 00:34:09.675
You may even be the person that
has valued God's word lately,

00:34:09.675 --> 00:34:13.605
and I'm hoping that you have been
spurred on to continue valuing him.

00:34:15.615 --> 00:34:19.695
But what we value will change
the trajectory of our life.

00:34:20.505 --> 00:34:25.005
I think Paul made a case for us today to
value God's word above all else, right?

00:34:25.455 --> 00:34:32.415
His life was an example to us or us, and
it was valuable because he showed us that

00:34:32.415 --> 00:34:35.115
God rescued him from all of his trials.

00:34:35.715 --> 00:34:36.525
Now just think about this.

00:34:36.525 --> 00:34:40.065
I wanna read this to you, Timothy,
watching from a distance saw his

00:34:40.065 --> 00:34:43.875
spiritual father, father getting ready
to pass on the baton of leadership

00:34:43.875 --> 00:34:50.215
to him, and he saw this, the teacher
review, correct him, provide training.

00:34:56.025 --> 00:35:01.065
Do you know the work that
God has for you ahead of you?

00:35:01.515 --> 00:35:02.935
He's ready to use you.

00:35:03.479 --> 00:35:04.529
To do great in mighty things.

00:35:04.529 --> 00:35:07.319
He's ready to transform your life so
that you know him in personal way.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:08.700
Oh man.

00:35:08.729 --> 00:35:11.609
Like, I want us to be ready.

00:35:12.149 --> 00:35:14.459
So during this time of invitation, there's
a couple of things that I want you to do.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.220
I, I want you to remember this, and
this is something that I talk about

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.479
a lot when it comes to invitation.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:20.609
If you've been a part of a
traditional church, a lot of times

00:35:20.615 --> 00:35:23.921
we talk about invitation and we
place in music and you're kind of

00:35:23.926 --> 00:35:25.049
sitting there going, what do I do?

00:35:26.399 --> 00:35:28.140
That was, I did that many years.

00:35:28.439 --> 00:35:32.819
I always wanna communicate invitations and
opportunity to reflect, say, God, I heard.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.940
What is it that I need to do?

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:39.480
What is it that you are calling me to do?

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.910
What is it that you've
revealed to me today?

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.800
And then you ask God, because
only God can do it, to transform

00:35:45.805 --> 00:35:50.320
you, to let that sink in, to help
you take those next steps, right?

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.140
So it's the time of evaluation.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.350
So have you valued God's
word as you should?

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:59.640
Have you allowed those around you to
influence you that have been positive,

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.960
to encourage you and spur you on?

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.660
Have you ever truly let the
word of God seek deep into your

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.790
heart for salvation in Jesus?

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.060
Today is the day where I would
say, it's time to get real.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:14.040
It's time to get real.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.530
So let's take some time to pray.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.740
Lord Jesus, we just thank
you, Lord, for today.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.330
God, we know that your word is truth.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:26.850
As John 1717 says, your word is truth.

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:31.845
And Lord, as we read today, I
believe these words pop off of,

00:36:31.965 --> 00:36:33.465
uh, the, the, the text here.

00:36:33.465 --> 00:36:37.665
And, and Lord, I pray that they are
filtering into our hearts today that

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:42.735
has, Paul not only taught the word of
God, but he lived it, and as Timothy

00:36:42.735 --> 00:36:48.825
followed after him, may we see a
call today due to that same thing.

00:36:49.515 --> 00:36:53.415
May we see the value of the
word of God in our lives?

00:36:53.925 --> 00:36:58.185
May we not miss the opportunity
to experience you in a.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.980
As we continue to pray, I, I want you to
continue to just be an attitude of prayer.

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.440
I want those in this room
to be thinking about this.

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.050
There's never been a time that
you've given your life to Christ,

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:14.820
that you've truly heard the word
of God and responded in salvation.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.030
I want you to know that today
is the day of salvation.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.650
You can give your life to Christ.

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:24.630
There's nothing stopping you
except for you surrendering to the.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.020
So if that's you today,
here's what I want you to do.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.690
I want you to recognize
a couple of things.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.610
First, that you're a sinner.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.040
That you need Jesus to forgive you.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.760
I want you to recognize that apart
from him, you can't be saved.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.040
And then to accept what God has given
you through this forgiveness of sin

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:45.990
and a transformed life in a new way.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.290
If you do those things, you've
given your life to Christ.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.510
So as we continue to
pray and as we continue.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:55.980
Go into invitation.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.410
I challenge you if you've given your
life to Christ, if you've repented up

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:04.200
your sins, if you've chosen to follow
Jesus, to do one of two things today to

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.990
either take one of those cards, fill it
out, and check Mark that you've given

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.950
your life to Jesus, or two, I'm gonna be
standing in the back during an invitation

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:12.300
that you come back and you talk with me.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:15.000
I would love to talk to you more about
how you can give your life to Jesus,

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:20.280
but as we continue in this invitation,
everyone, I'm challenging you to seek the.

00:38:21.165 --> 00:38:24.135
And ask the Lord, what is your response?

00:38:24.375 --> 00:38:26.535
Lord Jesus, move in a mighty way.

00:38:27.195 --> 00:38:33.315
Lord, I pray that those who heard how
to be saved, Lord, that they turn to you

00:38:33.675 --> 00:38:34.785
and that they give their lives to you.

00:38:35.085 --> 00:38:37.755
Lord, I pray that they are bold
today, that they don't miss out

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:42.465
on the opportunity to experience a
true personal relationship with you.

00:38:43.335 --> 00:38:47.265
God, I pray that they have boldness
to fill out a card or come talk.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:51.390
Lord, I also pray for those in
this room that came in and have

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.220
been neglecting the word of God.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:58.980
Lord, I pray for them today to leave out
with a pep in their step Lord, that they

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:03.090
have the word of God and they begin to
value it in such a way, Lord, that as

00:39:03.095 --> 00:39:06.900
they begin to value it, it transforms
not only their life, but their friend's

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.940
life, and those that they live around.

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.680
God, thank you for your word.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.720
We pray all this in your heavenly name.

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:17.830
Amen.
