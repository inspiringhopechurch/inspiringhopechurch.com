00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:04.750
Well, good morning.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.390
The timer went off, so I
assume we're supposed to start.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.640
It's great to be here with you.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.460
My name is Dave Ralph, for those
of you who maybe don't know me.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.020
Uh, I've been here a couple of times,
and it's just a, uh, a privilege to

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.900
be able to come back and share with
you a little bit out of this morning.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.130
I spent most of my career as a
Christian school administrator.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.720
So I was in the school system,
loved the school system.

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.259
One of the things I really loved about
it is that no two days were the same.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:37.435
You have all these layers of people
and relationships that you're trying

00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:41.105
to build, you have teachers and you've
got students and you've got parents

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:45.115
and all that, so it's, it's a, it's
a fantastic place to work and I

00:00:45.134 --> 00:00:47.084
thoroughly enjoyed my career doing that.

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:53.864
Because the school is such a complicated,
uh, organization, we developed handbooks.

00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:58.065
And so, we had a administrative handbook
so all the principals knew exactly

00:00:58.065 --> 00:00:59.795
kind of what was our expectation.

00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:01.645
We would have a, uh, parent.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.280
Student handbook so that when the kids
came, they knew what the classroom

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.580
was supposed to be all about, what
the rules were, what you're allowed

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.780
to do, what you weren't allowed to do.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.080
Uh, we had a Emergency handbook and
say in case something went wrong.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.330
We had an athletic handbook We even had
a coach's handbook so that the coaches

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.790
knew what our expectations of them would
be We had all these different handbooks

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.740
In fact in my office I had a three ring
binder about that big and I called it

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.669
the handbook of handbooks because it had
all these different handbooks all in one

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:37.414
place So as I began to read the book of
Deuteronomy, I was, I was engaged by it.

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:40.875
I thought, you know, this is like
a handbook, you know, this is like

00:01:41.054 --> 00:01:45.205
section by section by section, all the
things that if you wanted to be a good

00:01:45.295 --> 00:01:49.205
Jewish person, as you entered into
Israel, this is what you needed to do.

00:01:49.544 --> 00:01:51.864
I thought it was just really
cool and really amazing.

00:01:51.865 --> 00:01:56.325
In fact, in Deuteronomy 12 verse
one, it says this, these are the

00:01:56.325 --> 00:02:01.035
decrees and laws that you must
be careful to obey in the land.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.530
that the Lord has given to you.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.289
I said, Yes, this is a handbook.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.619
Now, the Book of Deuteronomy is the
fifth book of the Old Testament.

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.059
It's the last book of the first five, and
the first five are called the Pentateuch.

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.269
The word Deuteronomy means second law.

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.589
Now, it's not an additional
law to the law of Moses.

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.349
In fact, the original law
was given in Exodus 20.

00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:31.795
And then throughout the book of Exodus
and then into Numbers and then into, uh,

00:02:32.234 --> 00:02:33.945
into Leviticus and then into Numbers.

00:02:34.105 --> 00:02:38.045
It's kind of an explanation,
a fullness of the law.

00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:42.844
And then what happens in Deuteronomy is
that, again, he forms this handbook and he

00:02:42.974 --> 00:02:47.135
restates for a second time all the things
that the people of Israel need to keep in

00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:49.804
mind as they go into the promised land.

00:02:49.804 --> 00:02:53.464
There's lots and lots of interesting,
interesting stuff, uh, in Deuteronomy.

00:02:53.474 --> 00:02:55.564
If you haven't read that for a while,
I encourage you to go back and...

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.010
Wade through it just a little bit.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.980
It's really detailed, but, but
it's such a, a powerful book.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.900
To kind of give you a context before
we jump into, uh, Deuteronomy chapter

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.710
20, to kind of give you an idea of
this handbook, uh, it starts out kind

00:03:08.715 --> 00:03:12.250
of with, with talking about the feasts
and the festivals and how the Jews are

00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:15.700
gonna celebrate the faithfulness of
God when they get to the Promised Land.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.230
It talks about proper worship and
improper worship to make sure that

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.670
they're doing things the right way.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.290
It talks a little bit about their
judicial system, the law and the court

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.040
and how all of that fits together.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.600
Even talks about a king.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.049
They don't have a king, but
God knows that they're going

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:33.940
to have a king at some point.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.570
So he begins to give this wonderful job
description of what a king should be like.

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.129
Talks about the priests and the Levites.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.570
Talks about the prophets.

00:03:43.115 --> 00:03:45.105
Talks about cities of refuge.

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:50.235
Talks about being a good witness and the
need for witnesses in court to do justice.

00:03:50.475 --> 00:03:54.575
And then it comes to this passage
in Deuteronomy 20 about war.

00:03:55.955 --> 00:03:59.895
This is an interesting statement to
have in a handbook, you know something

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:05.215
about war So I started looking at it
and I really became very fascinated with

00:04:05.215 --> 00:04:10.175
this whole concept of war now Let me
start at the very beginning saying this

00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:14.380
is not This is not a message about the
conflict between country and country.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.170
This is not going to be a violent, at
least I hope it doesn't come across,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.950
as being a violent, uh, sermon.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.740
It's not a violent message today.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.140
This is really about the warfare that
we go through as Christians, that

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.289
spiritual warfare that we have, and I
think some of the principles that are

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.289
laid down in this handbook really, uh,
Uh, can be applied to our lives as we

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:42.270
do that same kind of, uh, conflict and
conflict resolution in our own spirits.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.919
So let me begin here and we're
going to take a look at Deuteronomy

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.940
20 kind of phrase by phrase.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.980
That's kind of the way that that I roll.

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.229
Uh, and

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.239
I had the same problem
last time I was here.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.669
Somehow it just doesn't like me.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.369
That's on.

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.979
That's on.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.749
Boom.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.140
Nothing.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.850
Okay, just hit that little
button there for me.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:16.840
Thank you very much good I have little
lines that I'm going to underline, and

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.359
we'll, we'll kind of forget about that.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.999
You'll just have to go with me as
I, uh, look at various words here.

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:23.520
But I'm a kind of a word guy.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.169
So when I look at a passage of
Scripture, I want to know exactly

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.379
what the Lord is saying to me.

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.200
So oftentimes I go by the word.

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:33.969
Sometimes I go by phrases just
to try to understand and to, and

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:35.180
to get to the bottom of things.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.810
So we can't go much further than the
first word, when, okay, when we go to war.

00:05:42.135 --> 00:05:44.465
Not if we go to war.

00:05:45.585 --> 00:05:49.045
The book of Deuteronomy was written
on this side of the Jordan River.

00:05:49.055 --> 00:05:51.164
In other words, they haven't
gone into the promised land yet.

00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:53.575
They're still kind of wandering
around in the wilderness.

00:05:53.604 --> 00:05:55.055
Remember, they did that for like 40 years.

00:05:55.294 --> 00:05:57.615
They're kind of getting close, very
close to the end of that 40 years.

00:05:57.794 --> 00:06:00.495
They're about ready to go
across the Jordan River, but

00:06:00.495 --> 00:06:01.895
they're still on this side.

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:05.555
But he says when you go across,
you're going to enter into war.

00:06:05.575 --> 00:06:07.215
It's not an if.

00:06:07.645 --> 00:06:09.265
It's a real live thing.

00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:12.165
The same thing is true of us as believers.

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:14.265
We are in a war.

00:06:14.895 --> 00:06:18.805
We fight against our enemies,
at least I do, every single day.

00:06:19.624 --> 00:06:23.304
It's a constant kind of
war that we're involved in.

00:06:23.665 --> 00:06:26.465
When you go to war, not if you go to war.

00:06:26.655 --> 00:06:32.815
And if you go to war, this word for war
is used four times in these four verses.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.520
It's translated war here.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.870
It's also translated battle.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.360
It's also translated
fight in this passage.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.260
But in the Old Testament,
war is used 323 times.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.269
So you can see that the nation
of Israel has been raised up in

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.260
a time to be God's chosen people.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.599
But it's a violent time.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.670
It's a, it's a war torn kind of time.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.630
And we're called to be believers
today in the kingdom of God.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.554
And it's a violent time in which we live.

00:07:00.135 --> 00:07:01.115
There are lots of enemies.

00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:02.625
We're going to talk about some
of those enemies in a minute.

00:07:02.775 --> 00:07:05.145
There are lots of enemies
who want to tear us down.

00:07:06.535 --> 00:07:08.245
If you go to war.

00:07:10.414 --> 00:07:13.005
And if you go to war against your enemies.

00:07:13.405 --> 00:07:16.414
Now the word for enemy, the
core word for enemy is hate.

00:07:16.934 --> 00:07:18.274
Those people who hate you.

00:07:18.575 --> 00:07:20.405
Those people who are your adversaries.

00:07:20.594 --> 00:07:23.135
Those people who want you done.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.400
And that's the physical aspect of the war.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.830
But we have enemies that are against
us, that are our adversaries.

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:31.809
They want to see us done.

00:07:33.489 --> 00:07:36.780
It says when you go to war
against your enemies and see.

00:07:37.835 --> 00:07:40.635
I gotta stop there too, because this
word, see, is a real interesting word.

00:07:40.635 --> 00:07:42.945
It's a word that has distance to it.

00:07:43.435 --> 00:07:47.435
So it's like, you're gonna see
the armies way far away, kind

00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:49.145
of in the horizon of things.

00:07:49.485 --> 00:07:52.464
Kind of reminds me of a lot of movies
I've seen where the good guys are

00:07:52.465 --> 00:07:55.354
down in the valley, and they look up
because they know the enemy's coming,

00:07:55.494 --> 00:07:57.935
and they look up and they see three
horses at the top of the mountain.

00:07:58.045 --> 00:07:58.485
They say, pshh.

00:07:59.335 --> 00:07:59.855
No problem.

00:07:59.855 --> 00:08:00.615
We can handle that.

00:08:00.895 --> 00:08:06.105
And then they begin to see wave after
wave after wave of the army coming down

00:08:06.105 --> 00:08:08.585
upon them, and it's just overwhelming.

00:08:08.685 --> 00:08:13.495
It's just intimidating as they see in
the distance in the in the distance.

00:08:13.685 --> 00:08:17.455
They're not there yet, but they can
just see this army pouring over top

00:08:17.715 --> 00:08:22.745
of their, uh, of the mountainside,
and they are indeed overwhelmed.

00:08:23.585 --> 00:08:25.215
They are intimidated.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.780
There's this intensity.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.960
Even when I watch one of those movies,
it's like there's this thing that happens

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.790
in the bottom of my stomach saying
this is not going to turn out well.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.790
The heroes aren't going to
live through this battle.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:36.829
It's impossible.

00:08:38.249 --> 00:08:42.979
So he says, when you see horses and
chariots and armies greater than yours.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.140
This is a huge thing.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.620
These people are outnumbered.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.590
When we look at our enemies, and
let's look at our enemies for

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.040
just a second, I have three that
I want to just briefly talk about.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.400
The first enemy is the world.

00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:58.489
Now I'm not talking about the planet,
you know, I'm really not talking about

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.320
global warming today or climate change.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.820
I'm talking about the world that
John first, yeah, John talks

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.350
about in 1 John 2, uh, 15, where
he says, do not love the world.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.900
The world is that
prevailing secular society.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.950
It's the whole value system
that doesn't include God.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.920
It's the worldview without God.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.350
Our secular society operates
on selfishness, selfish

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.810
principles, ungodly standards.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.910
Some of the principles that we see in our
world that attack us are things like greed

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.760
and ambition, pleasure and entitlement.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.810
I saw an interesting definition
of materialism because I think

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.500
that kind of summarizes things
in kind of in a nutshell, a

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.150
nice definition of materialism.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.709
It's we gotta get stuff and we want
to get stuff that we really don't

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:57.230
need and we buy it with money that we
really don't have in order to impress

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.560
people that we don't even like.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.930
That's kind of where we are.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.790
That's kind of the
bombardment of our society.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.340
All of advertisement has
that in their mindset.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.820
You cannot play basketball unless
you have the right kind of shoes.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.319
You will never be accepted in
your social realm unless you use

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.250
the right kind of toothpaste.

00:10:15.929 --> 00:10:17.960
You have to drive the right kind of car.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.300
You have to wear the
right kind of clothes.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.960
You have to have the right kind
of hairdo if you have hair.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.229
You know, it's those kind of things.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.990
You have to do these
things to be accepted.

00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:33.715
It is that society that's against
God that's without God in our lives.

00:10:33.715 --> 00:10:38.075
That's the enemy number one That's a
scary enemy to me The second enemy is

00:10:38.075 --> 00:10:41.855
even more scary and it's the it's the
enemy that I see when I look in my mirror.

00:10:42.304 --> 00:10:45.385
It's myself It's the sinful nature.

00:10:45.715 --> 00:10:48.885
We're born with the sinful nature and
we can't really get away from it We

00:10:48.885 --> 00:10:53.005
can try to kill it, but it's always
kind of there It'll always come up and

00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:59.165
whop you upside the head when you're
not expecting it It's that twisted,

00:10:59.195 --> 00:11:01.225
fallen nature that we struggle with.

00:11:01.225 --> 00:11:02.715
It's just bent towards sin.

00:11:02.715 --> 00:11:08.745
Galatians 5 says it this way, The
sinful nature desires what is contrary

00:11:08.745 --> 00:11:14.895
to the spirit, and the spirit what is
contrary to the, uh, the fallen nature.

00:11:15.865 --> 00:11:20.125
The sinful nature and the spirit
are in conflict with one another.

00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:22.165
They're doing war with one another.

00:11:22.185 --> 00:11:28.255
A couple of verses later in Galatians
5, 19 to 21, it begins to list

00:11:28.565 --> 00:11:32.574
the activities and the actions and
the mindset of the sinful nature.

00:11:32.675 --> 00:11:35.285
And I'm not going to read all of
it, but it includes stuff like this.

00:11:35.335 --> 00:11:41.464
Hatred, discord, jealousy,
rage, immorality, drunkenness,

00:11:41.525 --> 00:11:43.005
dissensions, and envy.

00:11:43.585 --> 00:11:48.095
It's that sinfulness that we really
can't get away from sometimes.

00:11:49.065 --> 00:11:52.985
So when you combine the world and
then our sinfulness, you can see the

00:11:52.995 --> 00:11:54.415
enemy is getting a little larger.

00:11:54.645 --> 00:11:57.035
And the third one is one that's invisible.

00:11:57.085 --> 00:11:59.435
So the world is kind of
that enemy from without.

00:11:59.745 --> 00:12:02.045
The sinful nature is kind
of the enemy from within.

00:12:02.224 --> 00:12:04.825
And the third one is an
invisible, uh, enemy.

00:12:04.835 --> 00:12:07.044
It is the powers of darkness.

00:12:07.065 --> 00:12:07.855
It's the devil.

00:12:09.035 --> 00:12:10.945
1 Peter 5, 8 says this.

00:12:10.955 --> 00:12:12.175
Be sober minded.

00:12:13.185 --> 00:12:14.115
Be watchful.

00:12:14.185 --> 00:12:17.505
Your adversary, the devil,
prowls around like a roaring

00:12:17.505 --> 00:12:19.945
lion, seeking someone to devour.

00:12:21.855 --> 00:12:26.434
And then in Ephesians 6, 11, it says,
Put on the full armor of God, that

00:12:26.434 --> 00:12:30.975
you may be able to stand against your
adversary and the schemes of the devil.

00:12:31.035 --> 00:12:32.245
He is the enemy.

00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:41.405
He's described, uh, in, in Scripture as
the deceiver, the liar, murderer, accuser.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.700
Tempter, the evil one.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:48.810
He's seen as seducing,
opposing, deceiving, hindering,

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.230
tempting, blaspheming.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.610
That's a pretty powerful enemy.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.320
So you have this enemy of darkness
and you have this sinful nature

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.340
within you and you have this world
around us in our society that's

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.130
telling that God doesn't even exist.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.050
It's a pretty heavy enemy.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.090
So when you see the horses and
the chariots and the army greater

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:14.125
than all of these, As spiritual
people, we have the same kind of

00:13:14.225 --> 00:13:17.015
overwhelming look at the enemy.

00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:19.465
And then, what does Moses say?

00:13:19.595 --> 00:13:22.685
He says, when you see all of that
happening, don't be afraid of them.

00:13:23.734 --> 00:13:25.104
When I read that, I
thought, wait, wait, wait.

00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:29.444
You just described this
incredible, uh, enemy, and

00:13:29.444 --> 00:13:30.375
we're not supposed to be afraid?

00:13:30.444 --> 00:13:33.595
I think I would be a little afraid
if I'm down in the valley and I look

00:13:33.595 --> 00:13:36.124
up and I see these waves and waves
and waves of enemy coming at me.

00:13:36.125 --> 00:13:36.935
He says, don't be afraid.

00:13:37.795 --> 00:13:42.035
This word literally means,
do not stand in awe of them.

00:13:42.984 --> 00:13:45.035
Do not stand in awe of them.

00:13:45.175 --> 00:13:49.034
And I'm thinking, I would, I think
I would be honestly, to be honest,

00:13:49.074 --> 00:13:51.905
I think if you see this, I think
I would stand a little bit in awe

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.214
of about what's gonna happen here.

00:13:55.254 --> 00:13:59.214
And so the question is, why not stand
a little bit in awe, why not be just

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:01.045
a little afraid of what's going on?

00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:07.380
And he gives the answer, because, because
the Lord your God The one who brought

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.290
you out of Egypt will be with you.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.009
I love this answer because
it's such a powerful one.

00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:19.939
He says, because the Lord, not
just a Lord, not just a king,

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.420
not just a mighty warrior.

00:14:21.459 --> 00:14:25.979
No, it is talking about the Lord,
the one who is over all things,

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.329
the one who has everything in the
palm of his hand, the almighty one.

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:35.665
This word is the word Yahweh,
and I find it so cool that, that

00:14:35.685 --> 00:14:37.595
Moses would use Yahweh here.

00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:41.505
Because Moses is the first one
who ever heard the name Yahweh.

00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:42.565
You'll remember the story.

00:14:42.805 --> 00:14:44.585
Out, he's out in the
wilderness in the burning bush.

00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:45.255
I love that story.

00:14:45.445 --> 00:14:47.515
And out of the burning bush
comes the voice of God.

00:14:47.674 --> 00:14:49.974
And he begins to dialogue
with the voice of God.

00:14:50.275 --> 00:14:53.835
And, and, uh, God tells him, Now,
Moses, you've got to go down to Pharaoh.

00:14:53.885 --> 00:14:56.004
I know he's like the king
of the world down there.

00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:57.285
But you've got to go down to Pharaoh.

00:14:57.485 --> 00:14:59.045
And you're going to go
face to face with him.

00:14:59.185 --> 00:15:00.295
You need to confront him.

00:15:00.295 --> 00:15:02.865
And you need to tell him
to let the people go.

00:15:04.465 --> 00:15:05.875
Moses is a little afraid of that.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.140
And I find it interesting because
the people are afraid here and

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.310
Moses is a little afraid of that.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.900
He says, well, who
should I say sending me?

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:18.000
And that's when out of the, out of
the fire of the fiery, uh, fiery

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:23.220
bush, it says, you tell him that
I am, that I am has sent you.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.190
And the name for Yahweh is I am that I am.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.170
So tell him that the Lord is coming.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:31.970
Okay.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.250
We need to be confident
here because it is the Lord.

00:15:36.265 --> 00:15:37.285
on our side.

00:15:38.444 --> 00:15:40.775
And notice how he flips
this very, very quickly.

00:15:40.925 --> 00:15:44.995
He goes from this transcendent
almighty God, the Lord, down to

00:15:45.295 --> 00:15:48.774
our God, not our God, your God.

00:15:49.944 --> 00:15:51.144
It's a personal God.

00:15:52.074 --> 00:15:52.984
He's gonna go with the army.

00:15:52.984 --> 00:15:54.744
Yes, but he's gonna go
with each one of you.

00:15:55.744 --> 00:15:58.074
The Lord, your God.

00:15:58.814 --> 00:16:00.685
This word for God is Elohim.

00:16:01.224 --> 00:16:05.395
And the word Elohim is the
name for God used in Genesis 1

00:16:05.395 --> 00:16:07.634
and 2 in the creation of man.

00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:11.145
I think you're going to be studying
Genesis here in a couple of weeks, maybe.

00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:16.014
Notice that when he's talking
about God the creator, it's Elohim.

00:16:16.314 --> 00:16:20.224
God is the one who's created the
world, but he also created you.

00:16:20.234 --> 00:16:21.295
He is your God.

00:16:21.454 --> 00:16:22.614
He's your creator.

00:16:22.854 --> 00:16:24.884
God knew you in the womb.

00:16:25.124 --> 00:16:27.084
He knows how many hairs
you have on your head.

00:16:27.959 --> 00:16:30.720
Not too hard to count mine, but some
people have a lot more hair than I do.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.250
He knows the hairs on your head.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.680
He knows how many days
you're going to live.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.689
He knows all of those things about you.

00:16:36.689 --> 00:16:37.380
He knows your thoughts.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.510
He knows your, your loves.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:39.400
He knows your desires.

00:16:39.439 --> 00:16:43.349
He knows you through and through
the Lord, the almighty one, your

00:16:43.349 --> 00:16:45.010
God is going to go with you.

00:16:46.119 --> 00:16:48.589
That's a pretty powerful,
pretty powerful solution.

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:52.059
Notice he has one more
explanation of who God is.

00:16:52.109 --> 00:16:54.229
It's one who brought you out of Egypt.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.340
I think he's really, uh, a
fascinating thing here is he

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.980
takes them back to the past, takes
them back to the past of Egypt.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.190
You remember when we were Egypt
now again, these people haven't

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.460
gotten in the promised land, right?

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.950
They're still wandering around out here.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.230
Do you remember Egypt?

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.690
That's when I came down, Moses came
down and, and, and, uh, I brought the,

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.770
uh, I confronted Moses and God is the
one who said I confronted Pharaoh.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.980
Uh, I am, God is the one
who brought the plagues.

00:17:23.835 --> 00:17:26.515
God is the one who plagued
all of Egypt, but he kept each

00:17:26.515 --> 00:17:28.425
one of you guys safe, okay?

00:17:28.635 --> 00:17:32.275
You were the ones, you were his people,
he kept you safe through all of that.

00:17:32.964 --> 00:17:36.295
You remember, he, Pharaoh basically
kicked us out of Egypt and we took a

00:17:36.295 --> 00:17:40.304
bunch of gold with us and plundered
the Egyptians, and then Pharaoh

00:17:40.354 --> 00:17:42.665
said, uh oh, I made a mistake.

00:17:43.085 --> 00:17:46.485
We need to get those Israelites back
here, we need to enslave them again.

00:17:46.595 --> 00:17:47.265
So what does he do?

00:17:47.375 --> 00:17:50.465
He gets all of his horses, and he gets
all of his chariots, and he has this

00:17:50.495 --> 00:17:52.815
big army, and he goes after the people.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.400
And when he gets to the people, they turn
around, said, Oh, man, we are boxed in.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:59.560
This is not going to be a good situation.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:00.820
We have the Red Sea behind us.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.620
We can't move.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.060
We're just going to get wiped out.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.960
We're either going to get killed
or we're going to take back and

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.319
we're going to be back in slavery.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.209
And then you have the wonderful
story of the parting of that Red Sea.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.360
And God parts the waters.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.620
And the Israelite people
just walk across on dry land.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.660
And then the horses and the chariots
and the big army get in there.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.839
And God, I don't know if He snaps
His finger, I don't know if He

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.040
blinks His eyes or whatever He does.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.859
And covers them up.

00:18:24.119 --> 00:18:25.530
Covers them right up with the water.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.680
By the way, Matt, thank you
for the songs you chose today.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.560
I don't know if you studied
this passage deeply or what.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.610
But man, everything we sang
today was just, it just rings

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.029
of truth of this passage.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.710
Thank you so much for doing that.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:45.480
So anyway, it is this God who brought
them out of Egypt and provided the way he

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.390
redeemed them and saved them from Egypt.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:53.670
It's that God, your God, that
Lord, who's going to go with you.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.010
And He will be with you.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.460
Notice again, the change of tenses here.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.580
Think back in the past, how
faithful God has been for you.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.140
And now He says, now you
will be, He will be with you.

00:19:05.439 --> 00:19:06.740
When is He going to be with you?

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.170
When you go to war.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.220
When you go to war, God will be with you.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.860
Powerful statement.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:17.769
If you go to the next slide, you're
probably going to have to go through just

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.120
a bunch of them to get to the next one.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.730
No, you didn't.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:22.470
Oh, technology, I love you guys.

00:19:26.629 --> 00:19:29.320
It starts out the same way, when, not if.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:31.830
Notice a little difference here.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:36.915
When you are about ready to go into
battle, Okay, this isn't seeing the the

00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:39.545
enemy from the horizon from the distance.

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.795
Now you're about ready to go into battle.

00:19:41.795 --> 00:19:44.475
I mean, you're talking about
seeing them face to face here.

00:19:44.925 --> 00:19:48.815
So when you are about ready to go
into battle, here's the protocol.

00:19:49.005 --> 00:19:49.855
Here's the handbook.

00:19:49.904 --> 00:19:51.045
This is what you're supposed to do.

00:19:51.234 --> 00:19:55.594
You shall call the priest forward
and he will address the army.

00:19:56.284 --> 00:19:58.324
When I read that, I
laughed just a little bit.

00:19:58.504 --> 00:19:58.904
Wait, wait, wait.

00:19:59.735 --> 00:20:01.275
We're about ready to go into war.

00:20:01.295 --> 00:20:03.925
I mean, this is going to be a
life and death kind of struggle

00:20:03.985 --> 00:20:06.805
that we're about ready to go into,
and you want the priest to come?

00:20:07.975 --> 00:20:09.344
No, no, I want to hear from the king.

00:20:09.385 --> 00:20:10.165
Oh, we don't have a king yet.

00:20:10.305 --> 00:20:12.234
I want to hear from
the commanding officer.

00:20:12.395 --> 00:20:15.945
I want to at least hear from the guy
who's going to tell me the strategy as

00:20:15.945 --> 00:20:18.325
to when I'm supposed to go and when I'm
supposed to move to the left and right.

00:20:18.485 --> 00:20:19.265
I want to hear that.

00:20:19.335 --> 00:20:21.335
I want to hear something
military that's going to help

00:20:21.335 --> 00:20:22.975
me when I have to go and fight.

00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:24.355
The priest?

00:20:24.355 --> 00:20:25.405
I'm not sure.

00:20:25.705 --> 00:20:26.805
That's the guy I want to hear from.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.720
Why choose the priest?

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.820
It's because God knows and Moses
knows that every battle that

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:39.720
Israelite fight, every battle that
we fight is a spiritual battle.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:45.270
We need to hear from God in order to be
successful, in order to be victorious.

00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:46.909
They're all spiritual battles.

00:20:47.049 --> 00:20:50.080
You just walk through, uh,
the, the, uh, the history of

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.460
Israel when they go and fight.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.750
It's all a spiritual battle.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:58.070
It's all trusting and obeying God when
they didn't trust, and they went to AI.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.710
They got smacked because they didn't
obey God, and they were defeated at AI.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.730
But every, every time that they are
victorious, just read the passages,

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.620
how they just rely upon God.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.210
They do crazy things, like marching
around a city like seven times, blowing

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.550
horns, and God knocks down the walls.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.600
He asks them to do crazy things.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.989
He said, okay, we want to
have a worship team next week.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.360
We want you guys to go
out in front of the army.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.150
Okay, and you're going to
sing, and when you sing, we're

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.690
going to come back after you.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.880
What military strategy is that?

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.520
It's craziness.

00:21:30.849 --> 00:21:35.010
But, when you're about ready to go
into battle, call the priest forward.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.999
And he is then going to address the army.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.110
He's going to come forward
and address the army.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:43.420
First of all, he comes forward.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.920
He becomes the leader of the army.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.320
And there are some times in your
life, in spiritual life, you

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.430
might have to be the leader.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:57.240
It might be in your family, it might
be at work, it might be in this church,

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.290
that God is going to call you to be the
priest to come forward and talk and share

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:03.949
about what God has laid on your heart.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.790
He comes forward and
He addresses the army.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.450
Now this word for address
is a very, very rare word.

00:22:12.615 --> 00:22:17.265
It is used only 1, 140
times in the Old Testament.

00:22:17.515 --> 00:22:18.875
It's a very common word.

00:22:19.145 --> 00:22:22.985
It means to speak, but it can also
have in the context a command.

00:22:23.224 --> 00:22:25.814
And so what the priest is going
to share might be a command.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.460
It can also be in the
context of giving a promise.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.690
And so there's promise that the
priest is about ready to share.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.770
It can be a warning to the soldiers.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.169
It can be a declaration of fact.

00:22:38.229 --> 00:22:41.820
And all of those things, I think, really
find some meaning in this passage.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.510
And he's going to address the
army, the people, the nation.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:53.755
And so he says this, Hear, O Israel,
Another great little word here, O Israel.

00:22:53.895 --> 00:22:56.305
It means to listen, but it
means more than just listen.

00:22:56.415 --> 00:22:58.235
It means to pay attention.

00:22:58.485 --> 00:23:00.835
It means to understand what
I'm about ready to say because

00:23:00.855 --> 00:23:02.215
this is important stuff.

00:23:02.455 --> 00:23:05.185
It means to listen so that you can obey.

00:23:05.765 --> 00:23:08.815
Reminds me a little bit of a classroom
and the bell rings and the kids don't

00:23:08.815 --> 00:23:11.434
quiet down and they're still passing
notes and they're still, uh, goofing

00:23:11.444 --> 00:23:12.605
around and all those kinds of things.

00:23:12.605 --> 00:23:14.085
And the teacher stands
up and he says, now.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:16.860
Be quiet now, did you hear the bell?

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:20.620
I have something I need to tell each
one of you in this classroom, and it's

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.559
going to impact you by the end of the
day, so you need to really listen up.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.810
Usually in the classroom,
it is dead silence.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.069
You hear a pin drop.

00:23:29.369 --> 00:23:32.349
And I have a feeling this is the
same thing that happens to this army.

00:23:32.679 --> 00:23:33.790
You can hear a pin drop.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.760
And when God is going to tell us as
believers how to live our lives, we

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:43.179
need to listen with great attention.

00:23:44.949 --> 00:23:50.889
Here, O Israel, today, right now, this
is the change here, okay, we're not

00:23:50.889 --> 00:23:53.340
looking out at the, at the enemy far away.

00:23:53.439 --> 00:23:57.299
It is like right now, it is today that
we're about ready to go into battle.

00:23:58.065 --> 00:24:00.465
We can see them eyeball to eyeball.

00:24:00.615 --> 00:24:03.405
We can see their ugly teeth compared
with our nice white shining teeth.

00:24:03.515 --> 00:24:05.764
We can see, we can even
smell their breath.

00:24:05.765 --> 00:24:06.225
Whoo hoo!

00:24:06.605 --> 00:24:07.635
Don't want to have that kind of enemy.

00:24:07.775 --> 00:24:09.875
But that's how close we are today.

00:24:10.034 --> 00:24:13.544
We are going into battle
against your enemies.

00:24:17.015 --> 00:24:19.985
Then he steps up and he gives
us four bits of information.

00:24:20.725 --> 00:24:24.315
And again, this is not what you
should do when you go into battle.

00:24:24.385 --> 00:24:25.635
This is what you shouldn't do.

00:24:26.075 --> 00:24:27.035
We need to go into battle.

00:24:27.155 --> 00:24:30.875
I think no, no, no tell me something how
to use my sword Tell me how to use my

00:24:30.895 --> 00:24:34.675
shield That's what I want to know what I'm
supposed to do not what I'm not supposed

00:24:34.685 --> 00:24:39.865
to do But he gives us what we're not
supposed to do because we are about ready

00:24:39.865 --> 00:24:43.735
to do the opposite of what he's saying
Don't do we're gonna do these things.

00:24:44.195 --> 00:24:46.005
Okay, so he's there to warn us.

00:24:46.055 --> 00:24:47.405
Don't do these things.

00:24:47.405 --> 00:24:52.575
First of all, don't be faint hearted Now,
faint hearted in the English is a compound

00:24:52.585 --> 00:24:54.825
word, and in Hebrew, it's a compound word.

00:24:55.045 --> 00:24:59.344
And the first word here is faint,
but in, in, uh, the Hebrew, the

00:24:59.345 --> 00:25:02.755
first word is timid or soft.

00:25:03.545 --> 00:25:05.875
And the second word is heart,
but it can also mean mind.

00:25:05.954 --> 00:25:07.385
It can also mean determination.

00:25:07.385 --> 00:25:09.155
It also can mean the inner man.

00:25:09.705 --> 00:25:11.765
So he said, you're about
ready to go into battle.

00:25:11.855 --> 00:25:14.165
Don't be Charlie Brown wishy washy.

00:25:14.455 --> 00:25:16.155
This is the time you need to stand up.

00:25:16.355 --> 00:25:18.374
This is the time where
you need to be courageous.

00:25:18.375 --> 00:25:21.475
This is the time where you
cannot be faint hearted.

00:25:21.475 --> 00:25:22.975
You need to be brave hearted.

00:25:23.465 --> 00:25:25.695
So if you want to put it in
a more positive, positive

00:25:25.695 --> 00:25:26.565
perspective, you can say that.

00:25:26.805 --> 00:25:29.944
Be courageous, be brave hearted.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.350
Secondly, he says, or don't be afraid.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.140
Now this is the same word that
we saw in verse one of afraid.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.240
Don't stand in awe.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.739
So don't stand in awe of this
army when it starts to come upon

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.450
you, you know, today is happening.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.080
You're going to be seeing these guys.

00:25:44.139 --> 00:25:45.590
They're probably not going to look nice.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:47.399
They're going to be really fierce looking.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.050
Don't stand in awe of them positively.

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.590
Let's say let's stand in awe
of the Lord, not the men.

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.300
Thirdly, do not panic.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.440
Don't lose perspective.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.920
Don't lose your composure.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.390
In our terminology, maybe
it's, don't freak out.

00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:09.500
Don't freak out when you see them.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.169
Rather, be confident.

00:26:13.899 --> 00:26:14.829
Don't be fainthearted.

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:15.810
Be courageous.

00:26:15.859 --> 00:26:16.650
Don't be afraid.

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:17.899
Stand in awe of God.

00:26:18.069 --> 00:26:19.440
Don't be terrified.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:20.840
Don't panic.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.220
Be confident.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.800
And then thirdly, it says,
don't be terrified by them.

00:26:26.489 --> 00:26:28.070
This word for terrified means to tremble.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:28.730
It means to shake.

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:33.310
It also can mean to flee or
to retreat or to run away.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:37.090
Don't run away when you see the enemy.

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:40.710
You're seeing them, but
don't be terrified by them.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.769
Actually move forward.

00:26:43.339 --> 00:26:45.379
Move forward with confidence.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:47.589
And it's interesting here.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.639
It does say, uh, Don't
be terrified by them.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:54.230
Literally, it means don't be
afraid on account of their face.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.350
Now we're seeing these
enemies face to face.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.830
And it's important for us as
believers in Jesus Christ to face

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.460
our, our, our enemies face to face
so that we can see what it is.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.230
We can understand what this
world is trying to pull us into.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.869
We can understand ourselves better and the
sinful nature that we're fighting against.

00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:17.310
We can understand this is a,
this is a, uh, a movement of the

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.080
holy, of the, of the dark side.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:22.830
This is a, a dark thing that we
need to just be aware of what it is.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:28.240
So we need to see it, but we do need
to not be terrified and retreat from

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.390
it, rather we need to move forward.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:34.610
And finally, he gives us the reason how we
can do that in the midst of all of this.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.159
And it starts out the same way.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:36.819
Thank you.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.460
This is verse four, by the way, not two
and three, but verse four says four.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:44.760
And whenever you see the word four,
think of it as an anachronism.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:50.040
And the F stands for following the O
stands for obvious and the R stands

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.090
for reason the following obvious reason
Why shouldn't we be terrified and run

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.520
away for the following obvious reason?

00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.430
He starts the same way as he did
in verse 1 for the Lord your God

00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:02.329
It's the Lord your God again.

00:28:02.329 --> 00:28:03.870
It's Yahweh Elohim.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.919
The Lord your God is the one I Think
that's interesting that he says he

00:28:08.919 --> 00:28:12.990
is the one Because the war that we
fight and the war that the Israelites

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:16.389
are about ready to fight it wasn't
about them It's all about God.

00:28:16.449 --> 00:28:19.240
He is the one in the
middle of this conflict.

00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:20.709
It's not us.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.030
It's not our own strength.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:24.300
When we try to do it on our own
strength and our own abilities,

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.480
our own talents, we mess up.

00:28:27.429 --> 00:28:30.350
But when it's all about Him,
when we can focus in on the

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.840
one, the Lord, the God, our God.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.020
He is the one who does three things here.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:35.480
Notice that.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.139
He's the one, first of
all, who goes with you.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.850
This word for go means to walk.

00:28:42.365 --> 00:28:45.645
I'm a hiker, so I, I interpret it
as, let's go for a hike, God, and

00:28:45.695 --> 00:28:47.284
God's gonna go with me when I hike.

00:28:47.575 --> 00:28:52.184
It could also mean to march, probably
a better suited, uh, interpretation for

00:28:52.195 --> 00:28:53.475
the army who's about ready to march.

00:28:53.695 --> 00:28:55.744
God is going to march with you.

00:28:56.145 --> 00:28:59.325
God is going to move forward as
you move forward with confidence.

00:28:59.474 --> 00:29:01.984
God is going to move with you.

00:29:03.274 --> 00:29:06.845
I, I think that these verses up here,
by the way, are, are some of the

00:29:06.845 --> 00:29:08.655
best Christmas verses you can choose.

00:29:09.555 --> 00:29:11.754
Because it talks about God being with us.

00:29:11.905 --> 00:29:15.475
And so much at Christmas time we talk
about God coming and becoming flesh and

00:29:15.475 --> 00:29:17.294
dwelling among us and being with us.

00:29:17.294 --> 00:29:19.605
In fact, it's Emmanuel, God with us.

00:29:19.715 --> 00:29:23.115
Well, this passage says God
is going to be with us when?

00:29:23.165 --> 00:29:24.284
When we go to war.

00:29:24.325 --> 00:29:25.075
When do we go to war?

00:29:25.115 --> 00:29:25.914
Every single day.

00:29:26.884 --> 00:29:30.284
God is with us every day and
every moment of what we do.

00:29:31.095 --> 00:29:32.345
God goes with us.

00:29:32.345 --> 00:29:33.725
God marches with us.

00:29:33.754 --> 00:29:35.314
That's why we can be so confident.

00:29:35.665 --> 00:29:37.514
Secondly, he goes to fight.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:38.629
For us.

00:29:38.699 --> 00:29:42.230
Notice that he's with us, but he's
also going to fight for us and he's

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.879
going to fight against our enemies.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.879
Now, I don't know if you've ever had
anybody say, Hey, I'm going to come over

00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:49.719
and I want to mow your grass for you.

00:29:51.179 --> 00:29:51.609
Sure.

00:29:51.939 --> 00:29:52.300
That's great.

00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:56.600
So he comes over and he brings his
lawnmower and he mows the grass for me.

00:29:56.629 --> 00:29:57.419
I don't do anything.

00:29:58.127 --> 00:30:00.677
I sit at home and I
drink my little diet Dr.

00:30:00.677 --> 00:30:02.797
Pepper and somebody mows my grass for me.

00:30:03.317 --> 00:30:04.437
That's what's being said here.

00:30:04.617 --> 00:30:06.257
You go into war, you can be confident.

00:30:06.267 --> 00:30:06.507
Why?

00:30:06.557 --> 00:30:07.577
Because you're not going to have to fight.

00:30:08.677 --> 00:30:10.807
God is going to fight for you.

00:30:11.047 --> 00:30:13.287
God is going to fight
against your enemies.

00:30:13.477 --> 00:30:15.707
If he's not the one who is
fighting against the enemies,

00:30:15.727 --> 00:30:16.687
you're going to get wiped out.

00:30:17.037 --> 00:30:19.147
But if he's the one who fights for you.

00:30:19.957 --> 00:30:22.717
You can send your choir out
front 'cause God is going to

00:30:22.747 --> 00:30:24.547
take care of the, the battle.

00:30:24.777 --> 00:30:27.747
You can just march around and blow some
horns and the whole wall's gonna fall down

00:30:27.747 --> 00:30:29.907
if God is the one who's fighting for you.

00:30:30.627 --> 00:30:32.967
And then it finally, it says
he's going to go with you.

00:30:32.967 --> 00:30:35.907
He's gonna fight for you, and he's
going to give you the victory.

00:30:38.487 --> 00:30:42.777
I can't think of a better Old Testament
word than this word for victory.

00:30:43.482 --> 00:30:45.362
Probably my favorite word
in the Old Testament.

00:30:45.572 --> 00:30:47.272
In the New Testament, I really love grace.

00:30:47.462 --> 00:30:50.272
But in the Old Testament, I think
victory is such a powerful word.

00:30:50.412 --> 00:30:51.852
It's the word Yeshua.

00:30:53.192 --> 00:30:56.892
And Yeshua means complete,
absolute victory.

00:30:57.572 --> 00:31:02.692
And Yeshua is the Hebrew word
that we get the, the name Joshua.

00:31:03.392 --> 00:31:04.832
And I think, how cool is that?

00:31:05.212 --> 00:31:09.052
Moses is the one who's talking, and he's
saying, you know, basically, Yeshua.

00:31:09.517 --> 00:31:13.067
It's the victory because Moses isn't going
to lead the people into the promised land.

00:31:13.077 --> 00:31:15.997
He's about ready to be done He's gonna
go up into the mountainside here in a

00:31:15.997 --> 00:31:20.327
couple chapters He's just gonna die and
yet Joshua is the one who's going to

00:31:20.477 --> 00:31:24.947
take them across into victory Joshua is
the one who comes up with the incredible

00:31:24.947 --> 00:31:26.347
plan of marching around Jericho.

00:31:26.587 --> 00:31:30.437
Okay, it's Joshua Who's the one who
is going to save them this word for

00:31:30.437 --> 00:31:33.417
victory means to deliver to rescue?

00:31:33.777 --> 00:31:39.357
To defend to bring salvation and
this hebrew word for yashua is

00:31:39.367 --> 00:31:45.457
also the root that we get the
name Jesus, isn't that cool?

00:31:46.727 --> 00:31:47.537
He's going to go with you.

00:31:47.537 --> 00:31:48.287
He's going to fight for you.

00:31:48.287 --> 00:31:48.837
And guess what?

00:31:48.837 --> 00:31:51.527
He's going to give you He's
going to give you Jesus.

00:31:52.787 --> 00:31:53.987
Jesus is the Savior.

00:31:54.387 --> 00:31:55.547
Jesus is the Redeemer.

00:31:55.877 --> 00:32:00.077
Jesus is all that we need to have
spiritual victory in our lives.

00:32:00.977 --> 00:32:03.957
So, we can go with great confidence.

00:32:04.097 --> 00:32:06.287
We can go brave hearted with courage.

00:32:06.337 --> 00:32:08.077
We can stand in awe of God.

00:32:08.207 --> 00:32:09.387
We can be confident.

00:32:09.407 --> 00:32:10.337
We can move forward.

00:32:10.407 --> 00:32:10.737
Why?

00:32:10.737 --> 00:32:13.607
Because Jesus is going with us.

00:32:14.017 --> 00:32:15.597
Jesus is walking with us.

00:32:15.727 --> 00:32:18.117
Jesus is the one who is
going to fight for us.

00:32:18.377 --> 00:32:20.407
Jesus is the one who will give us victory.

00:32:20.907 --> 00:32:21.607
Let's pray together.

00:32:24.477 --> 00:32:25.387
Father, we thank you.

00:32:26.572 --> 00:32:32.402
For this word today, Lord, all of
us are facing spiritual battles.

00:32:34.092 --> 00:32:37.922
Lord, it might be a battle we had
even getting out of bed today.

00:32:39.322 --> 00:32:43.802
It might be the spiritual battles that we
face as we as we look at our country and

00:32:44.412 --> 00:32:49.122
have such pressure at work or at school
or wherever it might be to conform to

00:32:49.122 --> 00:32:51.322
a society that doesn't believe in God.

00:32:53.222 --> 00:32:56.722
It might be that, Lord, that sin
that we struggle with so much in our

00:32:56.722 --> 00:32:58.372
lives and we just can't get past it.

00:32:59.532 --> 00:33:02.502
Lord, we, we're, we're
facing spiritual battles.

00:33:02.872 --> 00:33:07.972
Some of us are facing the, the powers
of darkness that are coming against us,

00:33:08.882 --> 00:33:10.592
and Lord, we need to have confidence.

00:33:11.542 --> 00:33:13.142
Lord, we need to depend upon you.

00:33:13.972 --> 00:33:17.902
Help us, Father, to trust in you,
to realize that we're standing

00:33:17.902 --> 00:33:19.952
in awe of no one but you.

00:33:20.622 --> 00:33:21.792
You are the Lord.

00:33:22.182 --> 00:33:23.322
You are our God.

00:33:26.152 --> 00:33:27.592
You come with us.

00:33:28.182 --> 00:33:29.562
You fight for us.

00:33:30.652 --> 00:33:31.612
And you give us victory.

00:33:32.402 --> 00:33:33.012
Thank you, Lord.

00:33:33.012 --> 00:33:33.962
We praise you today.

00:33:34.102 --> 00:33:35.812
We pray it in Jesus name.

00:33:35.812 --> 00:33:37.692
Amen.
